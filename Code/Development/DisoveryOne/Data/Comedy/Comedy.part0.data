          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
          
          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
          
          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
          
          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
          
                                 RIDER
                    Hey -- sorry.
          
          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
          
                                 KAT
                    Leave it 
          
          He persists.
          
                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
          
          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
          
          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
          
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Did you change your hair?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    No.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You might wanna think about it
          
          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
          
          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
          
                                 BOY
                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Awesome shoes.
          
          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
          
          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
          
          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I don't think so, ma'am
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
          
          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
          
          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
          
          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I missed you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    With the teeth of your zipper?
          
          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You the new guy?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So they tell me...
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
          
          They head out of the office
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    North, actually.  How'd you   ?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thirty-two.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Get out!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    How many people go here?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Couple thousand. Most of them evil
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    We've got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don't 
                    bother.
          
          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader 
          splendor.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Those 're your cowboys.
          
          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys  
          walk by.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That I'm used to.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
          
          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.  
                    Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden 
                    movements around them.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Michael continues the tour
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    And these delusionals are the White 
                    Rastae.
          
          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.  
                    Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a 
                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I 
                    mean.
          
          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    Derek - save some for after lunch, bub?
          
                                 DEREK
                           (very stoned)
                    Michael, my brother, peace
          
          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the 
          cafeteria.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So where do you fit in all this?
          
          INT.  CAFETERIA - DAY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of 
          studious-looking teens.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League, 
                    already accepted.  Someday I'll be 
                    sipping Merlot while those guys --
          
          He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various 
          passers-by.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    are fixing my Saab.  Yuppie greed is 
                    back, my friend.
          
          He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.
          
          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO 
          MO.  Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael 
          without a look.
          
          Cameron is smitten
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That girl -- I --
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You burn, you pine, you perish?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Who is she?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't 
                    even think about it
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I could start with your haircut, but it 
                    doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that's an impossibility.
          
          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?
                           (with dread)
                    Kat?
          
          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why didn't we just read the Hardy Boys?
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    I'm sorry?
          
                                 KAT
                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial 
                    topic.
          
          The other students roll their eyes.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.
          
          JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, 
          makes fun of her from his row.
          
                                 JOEY
                    As opposed to a bitter self-righteous 
                    hag who has no friends?
          
          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
          
          Really gets fired up now
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's 
                    worthy of our time
          
          She looks up at Ms. Blaise, who is now fighting with her 
          pill box.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    What about Colette?  Charlotte Bronte?  
                    Simone de Beauvoir?
          
          Patrick, lounging in his seat in the back row, elbows a 
          crusty-looking crony, identified by the name SCURVY, 
          embroidered on his workshirt.
          
                                 PATRICK

          The class titters.  Kat wears an expression of intolerance

          Kat now sits before Miss Perky.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've 
                    been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
          
                                 KAT
                    Expressing my opinion is not a 
                    terrorist action.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today's 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you're 
                    interested.
          
                                 KAT
                    I still maintain that he kicked himself 
                    in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    The point is Kat -- people perceive you 
                    as somewhat ...
          
          Kat smiles at her, daring her to say it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tempestuous?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the 
                    term used most often.
          
          She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    You might want to work on that
          
          Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the 
          counselor's.
          
                                 KAT
                    As always, thank you for your excellent 
                    guidance.

          Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in 
          big flowing handwriting.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                    I realize the language of Mr. 
                    Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, 
                    but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
          
          Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip 
          of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads:
          
          INSERT - "JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY  
          GOD!"
          
          Chastity frowns to herself.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                           (continuing)
                    Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment 
                    on what you've read so far?
          
          Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Not really.
          
          The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
          
          MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side 
          trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her 
          notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Mandella -- since you're assisting us, 
                    you might as well comment.  I'm assuming 
                    you read the assignment.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Uh, yeah, I read it all
          
                                 TEACHER
                    The whole play^
          
                                 MANDELIA
                    The whole folio.  All the plays.
          
                                 TEACHER
                           (disbelieving)
                    You've read every play by William 
                    Shakespeare?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Haven't you?
          
          She raises a challenging eyebrow.  The stunned teacher 
          doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are 
          eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
          
                                 MANDELLA
          
          Your sister is so amazingly without.  She'll never read him.  
          She has no idea.
          
          Kat attacks
          
                                 KAT
                    The fact that you're cutting gym so you 
                    can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear 
                    his name, is a little without in itself 
                    if you ask me.
          
          Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his 
          friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her 
          staring.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who's that?
          
                                 KAT
                    Patrick Verona   Random skid.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone 
                    for a year? I heard he was doing porn 
                    movies.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm sure he's completely incapable of 
                    doing anything that interesting.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    He always look so
          
                                 KAT
                    Block E?
          
          Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into 
          Mandella's hand.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a 
                    very slow way to die.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Just a little.
          
          She eats.  Kat sees her wrist
          
                                 KAT
                    What's this?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    An attempted slit.
          
          Kat stares at her, expressionless.
          
                                 KAT
                    I realize that the men of this fine 
                    institution are severely lacking, but 
                    killing yourself so you can be with 
                    William Shakespeare is beyond the scope 
                    of normal teenage obsessions.  You're 
                    venturing far past daytime talk show 
                    fodder and entering the world of those 
                    who need very expensive therapy.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    But imagine the things he'd say during 
                    sex.
          
          Thinks a minute
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, say you do it.  You kill 
                    yourself, you end up in wherever you end 
                    up and he's there.  Do you really think 
                    he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound 
                    compulsive who failed volleyball?
          
          Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
          
          ACROSS THE COURTYARD
          
          As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS   One of 
          the cohorts elbows Joey.
          
                                 COHORT
                    Virgin alert.
          
          Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' good, ladies.
          
          Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Tragic.
          
          Doesn't respond
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from 
          their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can 
          of beans linger on the grass behind them.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why do girls like that always like guys 
                    like that?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Because they're bred to.  Their mothers 
                    liked guys like that, and their 
                    grandmothers before them. Their gene 
                    pool is rarely diluted.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He always have that shit-eating grin?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish 
                    I could say he's a moron, but he's 
                    number twelve in the class.  And a 
                    model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's 
                    rumored to have a big tube sock ad 
                    coming out.
          
          The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their 
          empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries 
          to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    You know French?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You mean I'd get a chance to talk to 
                    her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You could consecrate with her, my 
                    friend.
          
          Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up 
          beside her in his Viper.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (re her dress)
                    The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't 
                    you been reading your Sassy?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of 
                    you featured in your big Kmart spread 
                    was your elbow.  Tough break.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (practically 
                           spitting)
                    They're running the rest of me next 
                    month.
          
          He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.  
          Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in 
          a convertible.
          
                                 KAT
                    The people at this school are so 
                    incredibly foul.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You could always go with me.  I'm sure 
                    William has some friends.
          
          They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and 
          Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
          
                                 JOEY
                    Need a ride, ladies?
          
          Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He 
          pulls away with a smile.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
          
          Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's a charming new development
          
          Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the 
          tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
          
          As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his 
          moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
          
                                 KAT
                           (yelling)
                    Remove head from sphincter!  Then 
                    pedal!
          
          Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry 
          at the delay.
          
          Cameron rushes over
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You all right?
          
          He slows to a stop
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, just a minor encounter with the 
                    shrew.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's her?  Bianca's sister?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
          
          Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's 
          grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint 
          jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
          - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of 
          her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds 
          several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
          
          Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she 
          types.
          
                                 KAT
                    "Undulating with desire, Adrienne 
                    removes her crimson cape, revealing her 
                    creamy --"
          
          WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type 
          obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a 
          doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
          
          I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before 
          Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
          
          He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to 
          kiss Sharon on the cheek.
          
                                 SHARON
                    In the microwave.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Kat)
                    Make anyone cry today?
          
                                 KAT
                    Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.
          
          Bianca walks in.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Where've you been?
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (eyeing Walter)
                    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
          
          She kisses him on the cheek
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hello, precious.
          
          Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
          
                                 KAT
                    How touching.
          
          Walter holds up a letter to Kat
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
          
          Snatches it away from him.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I got in
          
          Sharon looks up from her computer.
          
                                 SHARON
                    What's a synonym for throbbing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of 
                    the country.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I thought we decided you were going to 
                    school here.  At U of 0.
          
                                 KAT
                    You decided.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is there even a question that we want 
                    her to stay?
          
          Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
          
                                 KAT
                    Ask Bianca who drove her home
          
                                 SHARON
                    Swollen...turgid.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca; upset)
                    Who drove you home?
          
          Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's 
                    this boy... and I think he might ask...
          
                                 WALTER
                    No! You're not dating until your sister 
                    starts dating.  End of discussion.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What if she never starts dating?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Then neither will you.  And I'll get to 
                    sleep at night.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, 
                    Daddy!
          
                                 KAT
                    This from someone whose diary is 
                    devoted to favorite grooming tips?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Enough!
          
          He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Do you know what this is?
          
          He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from 
          the tape recorder.
          
          BIANCA AND WALTER
                           (in unison, by 
                           rote)
                    The sound of a fifteen-year-old in 
                    labor.
          
                                 WALTER
                    This is why you're not dating until 
                    your sister does.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But she doesn't want to date.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Exactly my point
          
          His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich 
                    before you women start dilating?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Tumescent!
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Sharon; as he 
                           leaves)
                    You're not helping.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.  Bianca arrives 
          in a flurry of blonde hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can we make this quick?  Roxanne 
                    Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an 
                    incredibly horrendous public break- up 
                    on the quad.  Again.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, I thought we'd start with 
                    pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
          
          BIANCA
          Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    Okay... then how 'bout we try out some 
                    French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
          
          Bianca smiles slowly
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're asking me out.  That's so cute.  
                    What's your name again?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (embarrassed)
                    Forget it.
          
          Bianca seizes an opportunity.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have 
                    a proper introduction ---
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Cameron.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the 
                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of 
                    loser.  My sister.  I can't date until 
                    she does.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Seems like she could get a date easy 
                    enough...
          
          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.
          
                                 BIANCA
          
          The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be 
                    really popular when she started high 
                    school, then it was just like she got 
                    sick of it or something.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's a shame.
          
          She reaches out and touches his arm
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a 
                    boyfriend...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Let me see what I can do.
          
          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
          
          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  
          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You're in school for one day and you 
                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you 
                    have no concept of the high school 
                    social code?
          
          Cameron grins away
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I teach her French, get to know her, 
                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in 
                    love with me.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can't 
                    go out with you.  So what's the
                    point?
          
          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What about him?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (confused)
                    You wanna go out with him?
          
          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (impatient)
                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.
          
          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What makes you think he'll do it?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He seems like he thrives on danger
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard 
                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just 
                    got out of Alcatraz...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They always let felons sit in on Honors 
                    Biology?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He 
                    sold his own liver on the black market 
                    so he could buy new speakers.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think 
                    we've got a plan or not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Did she actually say she'd go out with 
                    you?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's what I just said
          
          Michael processes this.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, 
                    you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.  
                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I thought you hated those people.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients 
                    when I get to Wall Street.
          
          A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
          
          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another 
          frog, with full-on sound effects.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'll let you handle that.
          
          INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
          
          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
          
          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his 
          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside 
          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
          
                                 PEPE
                    Some people like the Colombian, but it 
                    all depends on your acidity preference.  
                    Me?  I prefer East African and 
                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a 
                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian 
                    Sidamo in your cup, you're that much 
                    farther ahead than someone drinkin' 
                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I 
                    mean?
          
          Michael nods solemnly.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
          
          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hey, there
          
          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his 
          direction.
          
          Cameron slinks away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Later, then. 
          
          Michael watches, shaking his head.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker.
          
          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Are you lost?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Nope - just came by to chat
          
                                 JOEY
                    We don't chat.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Well, actually, I thought I'd run an 
                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if 
                    you're interested.
          
                                 JOEY
                    We're not.
          
          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (grimacing)
                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't 
                    you?
          
          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    But she can't go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her. right?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Does this conversation have a purpose?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    who'll go out with her.  Someone who's 
                    up for the job.
          
          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can, rather than in it.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but 
          the beak and the feet.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Exactly
          
          Joey turns to look at Michael.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          What's in it for you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will 
                    on my part.
          
          He rises to leave and turns to the others.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    I have a dick on my face, don't I? 
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork 
          off his face as Cameron watches.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got him involved?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when 
                    you let the enemy think he's 
                    orchestrating the battle, you're in a 
                    position of power. We let him pretend 
                    he's calling the shots, and while he's 
                    busy setting up the plan, you have time 
                    to woo Bianca.
          
          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You're one brilliant guy
          
          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
          
                                 MICHAEL
          
          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but 
          it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who 
          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
          
          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others, now watching.
          
          INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is 
          smoking.
          
                                 KAT
                    So he has this huge raging fit about 
                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to 
                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, 
                    number one golf team school. I have no 
                    say at all.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William would never have gone to a 
                    state school.
          
                                 KAT
                    William didn't even go to high school
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's never been proven
          
                                 KAT
                    Neither has his heterosexuality.
          
          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to 
          stub out Mandella's cigarette. 
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    I appreciate your efforts toward a 
                    speedy death, but I'm consuming.
                           (pointing at her 
                           food)
                    Do you mind?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Does it matter?
          
                                 KAT
                    If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any 
                    school you want, precious.  Don't forget 
                    your tiara."
          
          They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the 
          counter to place his order.
          
          Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Janice Parker told me he was a roadie 
                    for Marilyn Manson.
          
          Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Janice Parker is an idiot
          
          INT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
          
          Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (looking at chart)
                    I don't understand, Patrick.  You 
                    haven't done anything asinine this week.  
                    Are you not feeling well?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Touch of the flu.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm at a loss, then.  What should we 
                    talk about? Your year of absence?
          
          He smiles his charming smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How 'bout your sex life?
          
          She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Why don't we discuss your driving need 
                    to be a hemorrhoid?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What's to discuss?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, 
                    and as far as I can tell, you're only 
                    slightly psychotic -- so why is it that 
                    you're such a fuck-up?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Well, you know -- there's the prestige 
                    of the job title... and the benefits 
                    package is pretty good...
          
          The bell RINGS.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Fine.  Go do something repugnant and 
                    give us something to talk about next 
                    week.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various 
          desks.
          
          Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to 
          get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Look, it's really easy.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, 
                    sister.
          
          Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (rotely)
                    It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not 
                    related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a 
                    political figure.  I do not live in 
                    South Africa.  My parents just spent a 
                    few too many acid trips thinking they 
                    were revolutionaries.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                    But you freed our people
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Your "people" are white, suburban high 
                    school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I 
                    have not freed you, Trevor.
                           (grabbing his arm 
                           dramatically)
                    Only you can free yourself.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as 
          can be
          
                                 BIANCA
                    C'esc ma tete. This is my head
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Right.  See?  You're ready for the 
                    quiz.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I don't want to know how to say that 
                    though.  I want to know useful things.  
                    Like where the good stores are.  How 
                    much does champagne cost?  Stuff like 
                    Chat.  I have never in my life had to 
                    point out my head to someone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's because it's such a nice one.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Forget French.
          
          She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    How is our little Find the Wench A Date 
                    plan progressing?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, there's someone I think might be 
                    --
          
          Bianca's eyes light up
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Show me
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. 
          Bianca plays it cool.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Give me a sign when he walks by.  And 
                    don't point.
          
          The bell RINGS.  Kids flood past.  Then Patrick saunters by 
          with Scurvy.  Cameron nudges Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    There.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where?
          
          Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across 
          Patrick's path.  Patrick shoves him back against the wall 
          without a thought.  Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's 
          feet.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I guess he didn't see me 
                           (calling after 
                           Patrick) 
                                     Some other time --
          
          Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    My God, he's repulsive. He's so 
                    perfect!
          
          INT. GYM CLASS - DAY 
          
          Several volleyball games are being played.
          
          Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach 
          Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym 
          clothes.  They pull him aside roughly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (shrugging them 
                           off)
                    What?
          
          Joey points
          
          JOEY See that girl?
          
          Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the 
          ball into some poor cowboy's face.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah
          
                                 JOEY 
                    What do you think?
          
          Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared 
          of her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Two legs, nice rack...
          
                                 JOEY
                    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out 
                    with her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You just said
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need money to take a girl out
          
                                 JOEY
                    But you'd go out with her if you had 
                    the cake?
          
          Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.  His dislike for the guy 
          obvious.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had 
                    the plane.
          
          Joey smiles.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, 
                    you do the honors.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're gonna pay me to take out some 
                    girl?
          
                                 JOEY
                    I can't date her sister until that one 
                    gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.  
                    She doesn't want a boyfriend.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    How much?
          
                                 JOEY
          
          Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I can't take a girl like that out on 
                    twenty bucks.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Fine, thirty.
          
          Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it or leave it.  This isn't a 
                    negotiation.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fifty, and you've got your man.
          
          Patrick walks away with a smile
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice 
          session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over 
          the field.
          
          Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette 
          dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
          
          MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                           (proudly) 
                    Good run, Stratford.
          
          Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick 
          hops down to follow.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Hey. Girlie.
          
          Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (smiles brightly)
                    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And 
                    yourself?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    There's a way to get a guy's attention.
          
                                 KAT
                    My mission in life.
          
          She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, 
                    you see, it worked.  The world makes 
                    sense again.
          
          Patrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Pick you up Friday, then
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, right.  Friday.
          
          PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone
          
                                 PATRICK
                    The night I take you to places you've 
                    never been before.  And back.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?  
                    Do you even know my name, screwboy?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know a lot more than that
          
          Kat stares at him.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
          
          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (calling after her)
                    You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
          
          Scurvy appears at his side
          
                                 SCURVY
                    So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a 
                    new Blaupunkt.
          
          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He took the bait.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, 
          and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
          
          She wacks Bianca away.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you ever considered a new look? I 
                    mean, seriously, you could have some 
                    potential buried under all this 
                    hostility.
          
          Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
          
                                 KAT
                    I have the potential to smack the crap 
                    out of you if you don't get out of my 
                    way.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
          
          Kat SLAMS her door in response.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
          
          SCURVY You up for a burger?
          
          Patrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.  Patrick 
          appears at her side, smiling.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          Kat doesn't answer
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    You hate me don't you?
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't really think you warrant that 
                    strong an emotion.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at 
                    the track with me.
          
                                 KAT 
                    And why would I do that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, 
                    you with money in your eyes, me with my 
                    hand on your ass...
          
                                 KAT
                    You -- covered in my vomit.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Seven-thirty?
          
          She slams her locker shut and walks away
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her 
          teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.  She 
          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
          
          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her 
          car
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
          
          Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Are you following me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I was in the laundromat. I saw your 
                    car. Thought I'd say hi.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Hi
          
          She gets in and starts the car.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not a big talker, are you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Depends on the topic. My fenders don't 
                    really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
          
          She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, 
          which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
          
          Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- do you mind?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Not at all
          
          They continue on into the store.  Kat stares at them in 
          disbelief...
          
          Then BACKS UP
          
          Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious 
          Viper.
          
          Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the 
          liquor store.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing) 
                    You fucking bitch!
          
          Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.  Smiling 
          sweetly.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
          
                                 WALTER
                    My insurance does not cover PMS
          
                                 KAT
                    Then tell them I had a seizure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You 
                    punishing me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I thought you were punishing me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why can't we agree on this?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because you're making decisions for me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    As a parent, that's my right
          
                                 KAT
                    So what I want doesn't matter?
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're eighteen.  You don't know what 
                    you want.  You won't know until you're 
                    forty-five and you don't have it.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (emphatic)
                    I want to go to an East Coast school! I 
                    want you to trust me to make my own 
                    choices.  I want --
          
          Walter's BEEPER goes off
          
                                 WALTER
                    Christ!  I want a night to go by that 
                    I'm not staring a contraction in the 
                    face.
          
          He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing 
          Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
          
                                 JOEY
                    When I shell out fifty, I expect 
                    results.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm on it
          
                                 JOEY
                    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't 
                    count as a date.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I got her under control. She just acts 
                    crazed in public to keep up the image.
          
          Joey sees through the bluff
          
                                 JOEY
                    Let me put it to you this way, if you 
                    don't get any action, I don't get any 
                    action.  So get your ass on hers by the 
                    end of the week.
          
          Joey starts to walk off
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I just upped my price
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (turning)
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    A hundred bucks a date.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Forget it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget her sister, then.
          
          Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker,  
          then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing 
          scowl.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better hope you're as smooth as you 
                    think you are, Verona.
          
          Patrick takes the money with a smile.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY 
          Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?
          
          Bianca glares at him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    A "copine" is someone you can count on.  
                    An "ami" is someone who makes promises 
                    he can't keep.
          
          Cameron closes the French book
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got something on your mind?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I counted on you to help my cause. You 
                    and that thug are obviously failing.  
                    Aren't we ever going on our date?
          
          He melts
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You have my word.  As a gentleman
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're sweet.
          
          She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches 
          her toss her hair back
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (appreciative)
                    How do you get your hair to look like 
                    that?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days.  
                    And I never, ever use a blowdryer 
                    without the diffuser attachment.
          
          Cameron nods with interest.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You know, I read an article about that.
          
          Bianca looks surprised.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did?
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and 
          Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (without turning 
                           around) 
                    Say it
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (clearing his 
                           throat) 
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Whatever the hell it is you're standin' 
                    there waitin' to say.
          
          Cameron bravely steps forward
          
                                 CAMERON
                    We wanted to talk to you about the 
                    plan.
          
          Patrick turns toward them.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What plan?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The situation is, my man Cameron here 
                    has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What is it with this chick?  She have 
                    three tits?
          
          Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I think I speak correctly when I say 
                    that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than 
                    say -- Joey Dorsey's.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm 
                    just in this for the cash.
          
          Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his 
          beloved Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    That's where we can help you.  With 
                    Kat.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    So Dorsey can get the girl?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the 
                    big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set 
                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.
          
          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You two are gonna help me tame the wild 
                    beast?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (grinning) 
                    We're your guys.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    And he means that strictly in a non- 
                    prison-movie type of way.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Yeah -- we'll see.
          
          He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and 
          Cameron grinning at each other.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    We're in.

          CU on a party invitation as it gets handed out.  "Future 
          Princeton Grad Bogey Lowenstein proudly presents a Saturday 
          night bash at his abode.  Casual attire".
          
          Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    This is it.  A golden opportunity. 
                    Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In that case, we'll need to make it a 
                    school-wide blow out.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Will Bogey get bent?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself 
                    with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

          Joey stands ac his open locker with Bianca.  The locker is 
          an homage to Joey's "modeling" career.  Cheesy PRINT ADS of 
          him -- running in a field of daisies, petting a kitten, etc. 
          -- adorn the locker door.

                    I think I like the white shirt
          
          Joey nods thoughtfully.

                                 BIANCA
                    Hopefully.
          
          He gives her his best flirtatious smile
          
                                 JOEY
                    Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if 
                    you won't be there.
          
          He taps her on the nose and she giggles
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM 
          Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure have.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (pouting)
                    I really, really, really wanna go, but 
                    I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem 
                    to be goin' for him.
          
          He fishes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing) 
                    She's not a...
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of 
                    Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm 
                    pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex 
                    tendencies.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So that's the kind of guy she likes? 
                    Pretty ones?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say 
                    is that she'd dip before dating a guy 
                    that smokes.
          
          Cameron furiously takes notes
          
                                 CAMERON
                    All right.  What else is she partial 
                    to?
          
          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
          Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
          
          He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the 
          bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.
          
          Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our 
          two non-deviants pass through.
          
          Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    What've you got for me?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I've retrieved certain pieces of 
                    information on Miss Katarina Stratford I 
                    think you'll find helpful.
          
          Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Patrick)
          
          One question before we start -- should you be drinking 
          alcohol when you don't have a liver?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?!
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Good enough.
          
          Cameron looks up at Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Number one.  She hates smokers
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    It's a lung cancer issue
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Her favorite uncle
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Dead at forty-one.
          
          Patrick sits up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Are you telling me I'm a - 
                           (spits the word 
                           out)
                    "non-smoker"?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Just for now.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat 
                    likes -- pretty guys.
          
          This is met with silence.  Then:
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?  You don't think I'm pretty?
          
          Michael smacks Cameron
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He's pretty!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Okay!  I wasn't sure
          
          Cameron goes back to the list.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist 
                    prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of 
                    the indie-rock persuasion".
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what does that give me?  I'm 
                    supposed to buy her some noodles and a 
                    book and sit around listening to chicks 
                    who can't play their instruments?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ever been to Club Skunk?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow 
                    night.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Don't make me do it, man
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Assail your ears for one night.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's her favorite band.
          
          Patrick groans
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I also retrieved a list of her most 
                    recent CD purchases, courtesy of 
                    American Express.
          
          He hands it over.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Michael -- did you get this information 
                    "illegally"?
          
          Michael puts a finger to his lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I prefer to think of it simply as an 
                    alternative to what the law allows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm likin' you guys better
          
          He looks down at the list of CDs.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    This is really music?
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with 
          indie rock band posters and flyers.
          
          Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up 
          Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you turn down the Screaming 
                    Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.
          
          Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning 
          down the volume.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Don't tell me you're actually going 
                    out?  On a school night, no less.
          
          Kat shoots her a glare
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing; 
                           excited)
                    Oh my God, does this mean you're 
                    becoming normal?
          
                                 KAT
                    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at 
                    Club Skunk and we're going.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (disappointed)
                    Oh, I thought you might have a date
                           (beat)
                    I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, 
                    but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party Saturday night?
          
                                 KAT
                    What do you think?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think you're a freak.  I think you do 
                    this to torture me.  And I think you 
                    suck.
          
          She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.   Kat 
          doesn't bat an eye.  She grabs her purse and opens the door
          
                                 KAT 
                    Let's hit it.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the 
          line of kids below.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her 
          fake ID.  The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically 
          mono-syllabic.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (whispering to Kat) 
                    You think this'll work?
          
                                 KAT 
                    No fear.
          
          They approach Bruce.  Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
          
          Bruce looks the girls up and down.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    I can count.
          
          He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, 
          wearing a face that could only be described as "I AM a 
          Victoria's Secret model."
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    I'll bet you can..
          
          She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.  Bruce stares 
          at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Go ahead.
                           (to Mandella)
                    And you
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (all come hither)
                    Yes?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Take it easy on the guys in there.
          
          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy's inside pocket.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Next time, leave the Bic at home, 
                    Skippy.
          
                                 SKIPPY
                    It's a bottle opener.
          
          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Verona, my man.
          
          They shake.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Always a pleasure, Brucie.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss 
                    fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen 
                    belly-button ring for you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of 
                    minors come in?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Never
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. 
                    The other one kinda short and 
                    undersexed?
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Just sent 'em through.
          
          Patrick starts to go in
          
                                 BRUCE 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- what happened to that chick you 
                    brought last time?  The one with the 
                    snake?
          
          Patrick laughs and goes into the club
          
          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
          
          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.
          
                                 LEAD SINGER
                    Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and 
                    we're from Olympia.
          
          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.
          
                                 BOY (0.S.)
                    Pet my kitty!
          
                                 LEAD SINGER 
                    Meow
          
          They rev into their next song. 
          
          NEAR THE STAGE  
          
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be 
          having a better time.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.
          
          HIS POV
          
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.
          
          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!
          
          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
          
          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing to 
                           herself) 
                    Shit
          
          She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed.
          
          The bartender arrives
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (shouting) 
                    What can I get you?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Two waters.
          
          She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.
          
          She walks up to Patrick.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing) 
                    You're not fooling anyone.
          
          Patrick looks at her, surprised
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    hey.  Great show, huh?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
          
          If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it 
          over with.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    Excuse me?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    That's what you want, isn't it?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling; gesturing 
                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it 
                    for me.
          
          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    You're not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.
          
          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know.  I quit.
          
          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Oh, really?
          
          He motions toward the stage
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they're right up 
                    there.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know who The Raincoats are?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Why, don't you?
          
          She's completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I've never 
                    seen you look like that
          
          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.
          
          His cocky side is back in a flash
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.
          
          At that moment, the band starts another SONG
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling) 
                    What?
          
          The bartender approaches.
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (to Kat, yelling) 
                    You forgot to pay!
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    I got it, Rick.
          
          He tosses some bills on the bar
          
          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.
          
          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can't hear a word he's saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.
          
          Patrick smiles.  She didn't say no this time.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    What'd he say?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Who cares?
          
          Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Has he importun'd you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?
          
          Kat glances sharply at her.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor 
                    of romance.  You're the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.
          
          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Gigglepuss was so beyond.
          
          Mandella nods.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    They were.  I only wish William could 
                    have been here to witness the rebirth of 
                    punk rock with us.
          
          Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the 
          car.
          
                                 KAT
                    So true.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So, then she says that she almost 
                    didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing, you know, genres. And the fact 
                    that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
                    "really meant something."
          
          Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    You told me that part already.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hell, I've just been going over the 
                    whole thing in my head and -
          
          Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.  
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey.  Dingo Boingo
          
          Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around 
          slowly
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing; to 
                           Michael)
                    I hear you're helpin' Verona.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You and Verona?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What?  We took bathes together when we 
                    were kids.
          
          It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.  Joey eyes him then 
          turns to Cameron.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's your gig in all this?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm just the new guy.
          
          Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his 
          shirt and twisting it.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better not fuck this up.  I'm 
                    heavily invested.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- it's all for the higher good 
                    right?
          
          Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker 
          for good measure, as he walks away-
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Is it about me?
          
          EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and 
          annoyed.
          
          The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You're completely demented.
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (cheery)
                    See you next week!
          
          Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
          
          Miss Perky watches in horror
          
          MISS PERKY
          You two know each other?
          
                                 PATRICK/KAT 
                    Yeah/No.
          
          Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Patrick)
                    Dear God, stay away from her.  If you 
                    two ever decided to breed, evil would 
                    truly walk the earth.
          
          Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then 
          smiles-
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          The lights are on, illuminating the yard
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.  MUSIC is 
          blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    She's obviously not going.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak 
          past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze.
          
          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I --
          
                                 WALTER
                    And where're you going?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Otherwise known as an orgy?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria 
                    Steinem" over there isn't going --
          
          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.
          
          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?
          
          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, people expect me to be there!
          
                                 WALTER
                    If Kat's not going, you're not going.
          
          Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're ruining my life'  Because you 
                    won't be normal, I can't be normal.
          
                                 KAT 
                    What's normal?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but 
                    you're too busy listening to Bitches Who 
                    Need Prozac to know that.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
          
          Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can't you forget for just one night 
                    that you're completely wretched?
          
                                 KAT
                    At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked 
                    hedge-pig.
          
          Bianca tosses her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like I'm supposed to know what that 
                    even means.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard 
                    of him?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's 
                    boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not 
                    allowed to go out, I should obsess over 
                    a dead guy, too.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Girls
          
          Kat stares Bianca down
          
                                 KAT
                    I know about the goddamn party.  I'm 
                    going.
          
          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.
          
          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, God.  It's starting.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy.
          
          Walter looks dazed.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Wear the belly before you go.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, no!
          
                                 WALTER
                    Just for a minute
          
          He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
          pregnancy belly.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I want you to realize the weight of 
                    your decisions.
          
          He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You are so completely unbalanced.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Can we go now?

                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca)
                    Promise me you won't talk to any boys 
                    unless your sister is present.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Why?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Because she'll scare them away.
          
          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall 
          table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the 
          door and...
          
          There stands Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nine-thirty right?
          
          Kat's in shock
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I'm early.
          
          She holds up her keys
          
                                 KAT 
                    I'm driving.
          
          He peeks in behind her.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Who knocked up your sister?
          
          INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a 
          pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
          
                                 BOGEY
                    Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the 
                    right, shots in the kitchen.
          
          The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat 
          pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and 
          hollering within the jock crowd.
          
          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the 
          doorway.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
          
          Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his 
          forehead.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline 
                    just recede?
          
          He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's 
          already walking away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Where ya goin?
          
                                 KAT
                    Away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Your sister here?
          
          Kat's face shows utter hatred
          
                                 KAT 
                    Leave my sister alone.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (smirking) 
                    And why would I do that?
          
          A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
          
                                 JOCK 
                    A fight!
          
          The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash 
          their cupfuls on each other.
          
                                 COFFEE KID #1
                    That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you 
                    Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
          
          Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to 
          watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into 
          the kitchen.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Just who I was looking for.
          
          He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
          
                                 KAT 
                                 BIANCA
          
          Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
          
          A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts 
          another.
          
          GUY
          Drink up, sister.
          
          Patrick walks up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's this?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (mocking)
                    "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that 
                    what you're supposed to do at a party?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I say, do what you wanna do.
          
                                 KAT
                    Funny, you're the only one
          
          She downs another.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his 
          beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and 
          dishes dirt simultaneously.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (high-fiving a 
                           jock)
                    Moose, my man! 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters 
                    have already started calling.
          
          Cameron nods intently
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing; 
                           grabbing his belt)
                    Yo, Clem. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new 
                    Leanne Rimes. 
                           (with a Jamaican 
                           swagger)
                    Ziggy, peace, bra. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Prefers a water pipe, but has been 
                    known to use a bong.
          
          Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, 
          and points Cameron's body in her direction.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)

          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where did he go?  He was just here.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Who?

                    Joey.
          
          Cameron walks over.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Evening, ladies.
          
          Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Looks like things worked out tonight, 
                    huh?
          
          Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know Chastity?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I believe we share an art instructor
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Great
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Would you mind getting me a drink, 
                    Cameron?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Certainly
                    Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
          
          Bianca gives him a tense smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Surprise me.
          
          He heads for the kitchen.  Joey walks up and grabs her 
          around the waist.
          
          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just 
          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and 
          straw -- in his hand.
          
          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, 
          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
          
          Michael appears.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy 
                    just picks up a girl and carries her 
                    away while you're talking to her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're 
                    making progress.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No, I ' m not.
          
          He smacks himself in the head
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    She used me!  She wants to go out with 
                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!
          
          Michael pats him on the shoulder.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    At least you're self-aware
          
          BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a 
          drunken group hug singing "I Shot the Sheriff".  Kat has 
          another shot glass in hand.
          
          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured 
          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes 
          then looks away.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
          
                                 JOEY
                    So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog 
                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig " 
                    that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up 
                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Queen Harry?
          
                                 JOEY
                    It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, 
                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
          
          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting 
          difficult.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Neat...
          
                                 JOEY
                    My agent says I've got a good shot at 
                    being the Prada guy next year.
          
          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca 
          takes the opportunity to escape.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'll be right back.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity 
          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He practically proposed when he found 
                    out we had the same dermatologist. I 
                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, 
                    but he's not exactly relevant party 
                    conversation.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Is he oily or dry?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Combination.  I don't know -- I thought 
                    he'd be different.  More of a 
                    gentleman...
          
          Chastity rolls her eyes
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Bianca, I don't think the highlights of 
                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include 
                    door-opening and coat-holding.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're 
                    supposed to want to go out with are the 
                    ones we actually want to go out with, 
                    you know?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    All I know is -- I'd give up my private 
                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.
          
          There's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very 
          drunken Kat.
          
                                 KAT
                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need 
                    to tell you --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (cutting her off)
                    I really don't think I need any social 
                    advice from you right now.
          
          Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
          
          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Maybe you should let me have it.
          
          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
          
                                 KAT
                    I want another one
          
          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting 
          him from his task.
          
                                 JOEY
                    My man
          
          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (annoyed)
                    It's about time.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    A deal's a deal.
          
          He peels off some bills
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    How'd you do it?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Get her to act like a human
          
          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She's almost burlesque.
          
          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
          
          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
          
          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Okay?
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm fine. I'm
          
          She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs  
          her again, bracing her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not okay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I just need to lie down for awhile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to 
                    sleep
          
                                 KAT
                    I know, just let me sleep
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What if you have a concussion? My dog 
                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke 
                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell 
                    the difference...
          
          She tries to sit on the floor
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, 
                    okay?
          
          He pulls her back to her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    C'mon, let's walk
          
          INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs 
          his arm.
          
          CAMERON We need to talk.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron, I'm a little busy
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's off. The whole thing.
          
          Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h 
          back on her feet.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What 're you talking about?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She's partial to Joey, not me
          
          Patrick doesn't have time for this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron -- do you like the girl?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (impatient)
                    Then, go get her
          
          Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron 
          stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
          
          EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
          
                                 KAT
                    This is so patronizing.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Leave it to you to use big words when 
                    you're shitfaced.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why 're you doing this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I told you
          
                                 KAT
                    You don't care if I die
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, I do
          
                                 KAT
                    Why?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because then I'd have to start taking 
                    out girls who like me.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like you could find one
          
                                 PATRICK
                    See that?  Who needs affection when 
                    I've got blind hatred?
          
                                 KAT
                    Just let me sit down.
          
          He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a 
          swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How's that?
          
          She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then 
          FALLS over backward.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus.  You're like a weeble
          
          Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the 
          swing to keep her entertained.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Why'd you let him get to you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who? 
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate him.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big 
                    deal to get you to mainline tequila. You 
                    don't seem like the type.
          
                                 KAT
                           (holding up a 
                           drunken head)
                    Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can 
                    be "cool"?  You don't think I can be 
                    "laid back" like everyone else?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (slightly 
                           sarcastic)
                    I thought you were above all that
          
                                 KAT
                    You know what they say
          
          He stops the swing
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No. What do they say?
          
          Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Shit!
          
          He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up 
                    damn it!
          
          He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag 
          doll.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Kat! Wake up!  
          
                                 KAT
                           (waking)
                    What?
          
          He sighs with relief.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you were...
          
          They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES 
          on his shoes.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a 
          big swig.
          
          A KNOCK sounds at the door
          
                                 KAT
                    Go away
          
          Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the 
          smuggest of all possible grins.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Dinner taste better on the way out?
          
          Gives her a "don't even start" look.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I don't get you.  You act like you're 
                    too good for any of this, and then you 
                    go totally apeshit when you get here.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're welcome.
          
          She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
          
          KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kat's in the driver's seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the 
          keys out of the ignition.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cute
          
          BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside 
          Joey catches up to them.
          
                                 JOEY
                    A bunch of us are going to Jaret's 
                    house.  Wanna come?
          
          Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.  
          She looks at her watch.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have to be home in twenty minutes.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (eagerly, to Joey)
                    I don't have to be home 'til two.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Then, c'mon.
                           (to Bianca)
                    Maybe next time --
          
          They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
          
          Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca 
          standing alone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (slightly 
                           accusatory)
                    Have fun tonight?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Tons
          
          He starts to walk on
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Cameron?
          
          He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Do you think you could give me a ride 
                    home?
          
          INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm driving, so I get to pick the 
                    tunes.
          
          She changes it back to her song.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's my car.
          
          He changes it back.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    And I'm in control of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like 
                    them.  I saw you there.
          
          Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her 
          listen to her song.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    When you were gone last year -- where 
                    were you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Busy
          
                                 KAT
                    Were you in jail?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Maybe.
          
                                 KAT
                    No, you weren't
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then why'd you ask?
          
                                 KAT
                    Why'd you lie?
          
          He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the 
          music.  She bobs her head drunkenly.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I should do this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 KAT
                    This.
          
          She points to the radio
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Start a band?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (sarcastically)
                    My father wouldn't approve of that that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You don't strike me as the type that 
                    would ask permission.
          
          She turns to look at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, so now you think you know me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm gettin' there
          
          Her voice loses it's venom
          
                                 KAT
                    The only thing people know about me is 
                    that I'm "scary".
          
          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
          
          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they're both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.
          
          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    So what ' s up with your dad?  He a 
                    pain in the ass?
          
                                 KAT
                    He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Who?
          
                                 KAT
                                 BIANCA
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No offense, but you're sister is 
                    without.  I know everyone likes her and 
                    all, but ...
          
          Kat stares at him with new admiration.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know -- you're not as vile as I 
                    thought you were.
          
          She leans drunkenly toward him.
          
          Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then 
          Patrick turns away
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So, I'll see you in school
          
          Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, 
          SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
          
          CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
          He finally breaks it.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I looked for you back at the party, but 
                    you always seemed to be "occupied".
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (faux-innocence )
                    I was?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You never wanted to go out with 'me, 
                    did you?
          
          Bianca bites her lip.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (reluctant)
                    Well, no...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Then that's all you had to say.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You always been this selfish?
          
          BIANCA thinks a minute
          
          He pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Just because you're beautiful, doesn't 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    don't matter.
          
          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, 
          then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car 
          without another word.
          
          Cameron grins and drives away
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    And I'm back in the saddle.
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the 
          others enter.  The White Rastas are first.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of 
                    my heart.
          
          He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
          
          CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found 
          friendliness.
          
                                 CLEM
                    Yippe kai-aye, bra. 
                           (to Kat)
                    Dance for me, cowgirl.
          
          He sits next to Derek
          
                                 CLEM 
                           (continuing)
                    Okay, now tell me again why he didn't 
                    shoot the deputy?
          
                                 DEREK

                    my friend.  It was only the sheriff that 
                    was the oppressor.
          
          Joey saunters in and takes his seat.

                    Kat, babe, you were on fire.
          
          Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well now, did everyone have a good

                    Maybe we should ask Verona
          
          Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.  Kat looks up, 
          down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
          
          Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk 
          about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Okay then.  Well.

                    Oh, yes
          
          She clears her throat.

                    Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let's read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone?
          
          The class is frozen in apathy.

          Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in 
          his seat. Then grins.

                    Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom 
                    pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as

                    You went to the party?  I thought we 
                    were officially opposed to suburban 
                    social activity.

                                 MANDELLA
                    You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat 
                    and what have you done with her?
          
                                 KAT
                    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

                    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.  
                    It was big fun.
          
          Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat 
          and smiles.

                    Hey
          
          She gathers her things and bolts out the door.  Patrick 
          looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.

                    So you got cozy with she who stings?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that 
                    I'm about to lose.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What'd you do to her?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don ' t know. 
                           (beat)
                    I decided not to nail her when she was 
                    too drunk to remember it.
          
          Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then 
          turn back to Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          No shit.  She won't even look at me

          Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
          
          Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. 
          Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.

          Mandella is at her locker.  Drawings of William Shakespeare 
          adorn the door.  She looks at them with a sigh, then ties 
          her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut 
          off her air supply.
          
          Michael walks up.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                    Yeah.  I guess.

                    Oh yeah.
          
          She looks at him suspiciously
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who could refrain that had a heart to 
                    love and in that heart, courage to make 
                    ' B love known?
          
          Michael thinks for a minute.

                    Right.

                    I'm taking care of it.
          
          Chastity looks over from her spot on the field, but keeps 
          lips firmly shut.
          
          INT. BOOK STORE - DAY
          
          Kat browses through the feminist lit section
          Patrick appears, through a hole in the books.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine 
                    Mystique?  I lost my copy.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (frowning)
                    What are you doing here?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I heard there was a poetry reading.
          
                                 KAT
                    You 're so --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Pleasant?
          
          Kat stares at him, deadpan.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Wholesome.
          
                                 KAT
                    Unwelcome.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has 
                    her panties in a twist.
          
                                 KAT
                    Don't for one minute think that you had 
                    any effect whatsoever on my panties.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what did I have an effect on ?
          
                                 KAT
                    Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
          
          She pushes past him and heads out the' door
          Pat looks down at the book he's been holding in his hand:  
          Taming of the Shrew.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Cameron  and Michael flank Patrick as he shovels food into 
          mouth.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You were right. She's still pissed.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Sweet love, renew thy force!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. 
                    People can hear you.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (exasperated)
                    You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice  
                    yourself on the altar of dignity and  
                    even the score.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Best case scenario, you're back on the 
                    payroll for awhile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's the worst?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You get the girl.
          
          Patrick  thinks for a minute
          
                                 PATRICK
                    If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz 
          Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
          
          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
          
          The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    "This morning, I woke up with this 
                    feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, 
                    and so I just decided to myself--"
          
          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.
          
          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    "I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk 
                    about it.  And didn't I go and shout it 
                    when you walked into the room --"
          
          He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
          
          IN THE CLASSROOM
          
          Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. 
          Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big 
          finale.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    " I think I love you I "
          
          INSIDE
          
          The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, 
          mortified, but with a slight smile
          
          INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling 
          over their misfortune.
          
                                 MISCREANT 
                    Nice song, Verona.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Flog me.
          
          He makes the appropriate hand gesture
          
          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
          
                                 KAT (0. S.)
                    Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
          
          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.
          
          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.
          
                                 KAT
                    Sir, I'd like to state for the record 
                    that Mr. Verona ' s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You didn't have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.
          
          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.
          
          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
          
          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."
          
          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.
          
          The other miscreants watch with glee.
          
                                 KAT
                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
          
          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they're on the second floor.
          
          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. 
                    Rules stick.
          
          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something 
                    I've always wanted to show you.
          
          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
          
          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    These.
          
          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
          
          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.
          
          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you'll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
          
          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick's absence.
          
          Kat smiles at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
          
          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
          
          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing 
          no one.
          
                                 KAT
                    He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he 
                    cruised on me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    Look up, sunshine
          
          She does.  He's still in the tree
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I guess I never told you I'm afraid of 
                    heights.
          
                                 KAT
                           (smiling)
                    C'mon.  It's not that bad
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Try lookin' at it from this angle
          
          She assesses the branch structure
          
                                 KAT
                    Put your right foot there --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
          
                                 KAT
                    You want me to climb up and show you 
                    how to get down?
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (voice trembling)
                    Maybe.
          
          She sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she 
          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.
          
          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been 
          duped.
          
                                 KAT
                    You shit!
          
          She climbs down after him
          
          EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY 
          
          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
          
                                 KAT
                    The Partridge Family?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I figured it had to be something 
                    ridiculous to win your respect.  And 
                    piss you off.
          
                                 KAT
                    Good call.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So how'd you get Chapin to look the 
                    other way?
          
                                 KAT
                    I dazzled him with my wit
          
          She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
          giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a 
          stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID 
          next to her and they continue walking.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    A soft side? Who knew?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, well, don't let it get out
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what's your excuse?
          
                                 KAT
                    Acting the way we do.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yes
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't like to do what people expect.  
                    Then they expect it all the time and 
                    they get disappointed when you change.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So if you disappoint them from the 
                    start, you're covered?
          
                                 KAT
                    Something like that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then you screwed up
          
                                 KAT
                    How?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You never disappointed me.
          
          She blushes under his gaze
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You up for it?
          
                                 KAT
                    For. . . ?
          
          He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
          stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
          
          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
          
          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
          her face.
          
          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they're both covered in paint
          
          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Damn it!
          
          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.
          
          It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other's eyes.
          
          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he 
          goes to kiss her.

          His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has 
          turned into a passionate kiss
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.  Their paint wardrobe 
          has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
          strange, yet colorful, war.
          
                                 KAT
                    State trooper?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fallacy.
          
                                 KAT
                    The duck?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hearsay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know the porn career's a lie.
          
          He shuts off the car and turns to her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do you?
          
          He kisses her neck.  It tickles.  She laughs.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tell me something true.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I hate peas.
          
                                 KAT
                    No -- something real.  Something no one 
                    else knows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (in-between kisses)
                    You're sweet.  And sexy.  And 
                    completely hot for me.
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No one else knows
          
                                 KAT
                    You're amazingly self-assured. Has 
                    anyone ever told you that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Go to the prom with me
          
          Kat's smile disappears.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that a request or a command?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know what I mean
          
                                 KAT
                    No.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No what?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, I won't go with you
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Why not?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because I don't want to. It's a stupid 
                    tradition.
          
          Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he 
          being paid to take her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    People won't expect you to go...
          
          Kat turns to him, getting angry.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                                 KAT
                    All of it -- what's in it for you?
          
          He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
          suspicions.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Create a little drama?  Start a new 
                    rumor?  What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So I have to have a motive to be with 
                    you?
          
                                 KAT
                    You tell me.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told 
                    you that?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (quietly)
                    Answer the question, Patrick
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (angry)
                    Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.  
                    Just the pleasure of your company.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.  She breaks it in half before she 
          SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
          
          Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
          door and watches him go
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
          
          He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
          has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
          
          Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
          gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    cover that up
          
          The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
          Bianca TAPS on the open door.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Quick question -- are you going to the 
                    prom?
          
          Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM

          Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.  She 
          fingers a strand of her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Then Guillermo says, "If you go any 
                    lighter, you're gonna look like an extra 
                    on 90210."
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No...
          
          Bianca stares at him for a moment.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    do you listen to this crap?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What crap?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm 
                    like, boring myself.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more 
                    story about your coiffure...
          
          He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
          smacks his hand away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    I figured you'd get to the good stuff 
                    eventually.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What good stuff?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The "real you".
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
          
          He looks stricken.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I'm kidding. 
                           (beat)
                    You know how sometimes you just become 
                    this "persona"?  And you don't know how 
                    to quit?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (matter of fact)
                    No
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how 
                    to lie.

          Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.  Finally, it 
          opens.
          
          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
          
          INSERT - "0 FAIR ONE.  JOIN ME AT THE PROM.  I WILL BE 
          WAITING.  LOVE, WILLIAM S."
          
          Mandella's agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
          dress.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're gonna look splendiferous in 
                    that, Mandella.
          
          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                           (continuing)
                    that's cool to say.

          Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
          
                                 SHARON
                    Would you rather be ravished by a 
                    pirate or a British rear admiral?

                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
                    you. It's tomorrow night --
          
                                 WALTER
                    The prom?  Kat has a date?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, but
          
                                 WALTER
                    It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s 
                    who you want me to bend my rules for?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that 
                    is.
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're not going unless your sister 
                    goes.  End of story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my 
                    own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a 
                    possession!
          
          Bianca storms out.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (calling out)
                    You know what happens at proms?
          
          Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
          
                                 SHARON
                    They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll 
                    come home.  Let her go.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Kissing?  Is that what you think 
                    happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up 
                    to my elbows in placenta all day.
          
          INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca lies on her bed.  MTV blares.  A KNOCK sounds.
          
          BIANCA
          Come in.
          
          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (kindly)
                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
                    home because I'm not Susie High School.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like you care.
          
                                 KAT
                    I do care. But I'm a firm believer in 
                    doing something for your own reasons, 
                    not someone else ' s .
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only 
                    sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
                    I can't go, because you won ' t.
          
          Kat clears her throat
          
                                 KAT
                    Joey never told you we went out, did 
                    he?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    In 9th.  For a month
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (confused)
                    Why?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (self-mocking)
                    He was, like, a total babe
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But you hate Joey
          
                                 KAT
                    Now I do.  Back then, was a different 
                    story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    As in...
          
          Kat takes a deep breath.
          
                                 KAT
                    He said everyone was doing it.  So I 
                    did it.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did what?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing on)
                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I 
                    didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.  
                    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with 
                    me.
          
          Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 KAT
                    After that, I swore I'd never do 
                    anything just because "everyone else" 
                    was doing it.  And I haven't since. 
                    Except for Bogey's party, and my 
                    stunning gastro-intestinal display --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (stunned)
                    Why didn't you tell me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I wanted to let you make up your own 
                    mind about him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No. you didn't!  If you really thought 
                    I could make my own decisions, you 
                    would've let me go out with him instead 
                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
          
          Kat stands up slowly
          
                                 KAT
                    That's not
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'm not stupid enough to repeat your 
                    mistakes.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    God, you're just like him! Just keep me 
                    locked away in the dark, so I can't 
                    experience anything for myself
          
                                 KAT
                    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
                    You can't always trust the people you 
                    want to.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I guess I'll never know, will I?
          
          She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
          behind her.
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
          
          A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  She rolls over and 
          picks up the phone.
          
          BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
          watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.
          
          A KNOCK sounds
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Come in.
          
          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
          
                                 KAT
                    Feel like shopping?
          
          Bianca looks up, hopefully.
          
          LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter 
          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What do you wanna watch?  We've got 
                    crap, crap, crap or crap
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Dr. Ruth?
          
          Bianca walks into the living room.  She's wearing a prom 
          dress.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi, Mommy.
                           (looking away)
                                 WALTER
          
          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
          to Sharon.
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Honey, you look beautiful!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You like?  My date should be here in 
                    five.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm missing something.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a 
                    captain of oppression like some men we 
                    know.
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands 
          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca's outfit.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Wow
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let's go.
          
          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
          
                                 SHARON 
                           (to Bianca)
                    Have a great time, honey!
          
                                 WALTER
                    But -- who -- what --?
          
          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a 
          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has 
          Kat ' s voice.
          
                                 KAT
                    Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See 
                    you in a few.
          
          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon 'are alone
          
                                 WALTER
                    What just happened?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Your daughters went to the prom.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Did I have anything to say about it?
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Absolutely not.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That ' s what I thought
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on 
          the porch, wearing a tux.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I'm here to pick up Bianca.
          
                                 WALTER
                    late
          
          He SLAMS the door shut
          
          EXT  HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice 
          gown.
          
          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.
          
                                 KAT
                    How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.  
                    Where'd you get the dress?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just something I had.  You know
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Oh huh
          
                                 KAT
                    Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I 
                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
          
          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No prob.
          
          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.
          
                                 KAT
                    are you ready?
          
          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image 
          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    C'mon.  Let's get this over with.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick 
          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Quite the ostentatious display
          
          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots
          
          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and 
          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, 
          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries 
          over.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Have you seen him?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William - he asked me to meet him here.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' 
                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.
          
          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and 
          points Mandella the same way.
          
          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on 
          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't 
          be bigger.
          
          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand 
          and leading her onto the dance floor.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Mi' lady.
          
                           (to Patrick)
                    Good sir.
          
          Patrick rolls his eyes.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT - LATER
          
          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he's 
          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
          
          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She 
          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room
          
          INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a

                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    You think you ' re the only sophomore 
                    at the prom?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I did.
          
          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    And just so you know, my date isn't 
                    planning on spending most of the night 
                    in his backseat.
          
          BIANCA What're you talking about?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - 
                    your cherry. He practically made a 
                    public announcement.
          
          Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity  tries to backpedal.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (continuing)
                    I wanted to tell you
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few 
          stray jocks - also dateless.  He zeroes in on Cameron, now 
          consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
          
          Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the 
          evil about to erupt.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    My grandmother's .
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    That's where I was last year.  She'd 
                    never lived alone -- my grandfather died 
                    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, 
                    I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've 
                    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent 
                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the 
                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of 
                    story.
          
          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat 
          stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
          
                                 KAT
                    That ' s completely adorable!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It gets worse -- you still have your 
                    freshman yearbook?
          
          He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's Bianca doing here with that 
                    cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let 
                    some little punk ass snake me.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to 
          Cameron and Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Feces hitting fan.  C'mon
          
          Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca 
          staring after them.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt 
          Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this 
          situation.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it 
                    easy.
          
          Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
          
          JOEY You two are in big trouble
          
          Cameron faces Joey.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
          
          Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise 
          Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon 
          surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White 
          Rastas.
          
                                 DEREK 
                    Very uncool, my brother
          
                                 JOEY
                    I'm not your brother, white boy.
          
          The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that 
          they're white.
          
          Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Just so you know -- she'll only spread 
                    her legs once.
          
          Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing. 
          Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. 
          It's Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him
          
                                 BIANCA
                    That's for making my date bleed
          
          She BELTS him again
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    That's for my sister.
          
          And AGAIN
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    And that's for me.
          
          Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
          
                                 COWBOY
                    And that's for the fourth grade, 
                    asshole.
          
          HOTEL - NIGHT 
          
          KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Wait I...
          
                                 KAT
                    You were paid to take me out!  By -- 
                    the one person I truly hate.  I knew it 
                    was a set-up!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It wasn't like that.
          
                                 KAT
                    Really?  What was it like?  A down 
                    payment now, then a bonus for sleeping 
                    with me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I didn't care about the money.
          
          He catches up to her now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I cared about --
          
          She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than 
          in anger.
          
                                 KAT
                    You are so not what I thought you were.
          
          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
          
          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's 
          never looked more guilty.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a 
          blanket, watching "Sixteen Candles".  When Molly Ringwald 
          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial
          
          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes 
          in, bearing a cup of tea.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Are you sure you don't want to come 
                    with us?  It'll be fun.
          
          Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
          
                                 KAT
                    I ' m sure .
          
          Bianca sits down next to her
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You looked beautiful last night, you 
                    know.
          
                                 KAT
                    So did you
          
          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his 
          head inside.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She okay?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I hope so.
          
          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Was that your sister?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big 
                    ones.  Full of sperm.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Funny.
          
          Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the 
          infomercial with Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I don't understand the allure of 
                    dehydrated food.  Is this something I 
                    should be hip to?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, Daddy.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (dreading the 
                           answer)
                    So tell me about this dance. Was it 
                    fun?
          
                                 KAT
                    Parts of it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Which parts?
          
                                 KAT
                    The part where Bianca beat the hell out 
                    of some guy.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Bianca did what?
          
                                 KAT
                    What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed 
                    off on her?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No -- impressed.
          
          Kat looks up in surprise.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    You know, fathers don't like to admit 
                    that their daughters are capable of 
                    running their own lives.  It means we've 
                    become spectators.  Bianca still lets me 
                    play a few innings.  You've had me on 
                    the bleachers for years.  When you go to 
                    Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to 
                    watch the game.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (hopeful)
                    When I go?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've 
                    changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a 
                    check.
          
          Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes 
          from the food line.

                    Katarina?
          
          She turns and looks at him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'd like to express my apologies.
          
                                 KAT
                    For what?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    I didn't mean for you to get -- When 
                    Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, 
                    I had no idea it would turn out so -- 
                    ugly. I would never have  done anything 
                    to compromise your - - -
          
          He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray 
          against the wall and marched off -- the old "kill, kill" 
          look back in her eyes.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY

          CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open 
          book in hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Who can tell me at what point Lucentio 
                    admits his deception?
          
          The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks 
          in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward 
          the hallway.
          
                                 KAT

          Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair 
          between two rows of lockers.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let go!
          
                                 KAT
                    You set me up.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I just wanted --
          
                                 KAT
                    What? To completely damage me?  To send 
                    me to therapy forever? What?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No! I just wanted
          
          Miss Perky walks up
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my 
                    office?
          
          INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, 
          then focuses on Bianca.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    So you're the real bitch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.  
                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I'm sorry.
          
          She turns to Kat.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I swear -- I didn't know about the 
                    money.  I didn't even know Joey was 
                    involved.  I would never intentionally 
                    hurt you, Kat.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Kat)
                    Do you care to respond?
          
                                 KAT
                    Am I supposed to feel better? Like, 
                    right now?  Or do I have some time to 
                    think about it?
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    Just smack her now.
          
          Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (to Miss Perky)
                    We'll be getting back to you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    What, no hug?
          
          HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          And Bianca leave Miss Perky's office
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or 
                    is it just me?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just you.

          Mrs. Blaise faces the class
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    All right.  I'm assuming everyone found 
                    time to compose, their poems. Except for 
                    Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
          
          Nerds in the back high-five each other.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
          
          No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'11 go
          
          Patrick looks up.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord.
          
          She downs a couple Prozac
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Please proceed.
          
          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate the way you talk to me/ and the 
                    way you cut your hair/ I hate the way 
                    you drive my car/ I hate it when you 
                    stare.
          
          She pauses, then continues
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and 
                    the way you read my mind/ I hate you so 
                    much it makes me sick/ it even makes me 
                    rhyme.
          
          She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who 
          stares at the floor.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate the way you're always right/ I 
                    hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you 
                    make me laugh/ even worse when you make 
                    me cry/ I hate it that you're not 
                    around/ and the fact that you didn't 
                    call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' 
                    t hate you/ not even close, not even a 
                    little bit, not even any at all.
          
          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.
          
          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.
          
          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.
          
          Patrick stands there, smiling.
          
                                 KAT
                    A Fender Strat. You bought this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you could use it. When you 
                    start your band.
          
          She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Besides, I had some extra cash. Some 
                    asshole paid me to take out a really 
                    great girl.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that right?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for 
                    her.
          
          Blushes and looks down.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You know -- it's not every day you find 
                    a girl who'll flash her tits to get you 
                    out of detention.
          
          Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
          
          He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does 
          She lets him this time.
          
          Then breaks it off
          
                                 KAT
                    You can't just buy me a guitar every 
                    time you screw up, you know.
          
          He grimaces.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know
          
          He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
          
                                 KAT
                    And don't just think you can
          
          He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.

                                 KAT
                    Why is my veggie burger the only burnt 
                    object on this grill?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because I like to torture you.

                    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman 
                    yearbook?

          ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.

          ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
          
          Severely making-out in a lawn chair.  She comes up for a 
          breath.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    I can't remember a word of Shakespeare

          Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND 
          PATRICK
          
          She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca 
          now hands her.
          
                                 KAT

          Flips to a page.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'd like to call your attention to 
                    Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look 
                    of 1995 ---
          
          INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, 
          bad hair, headgear -- the works.
          
          She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes 
          and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Patrick -- is that- a.

          Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we 
          CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge

          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
          
          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
          
          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
          
          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
          
                                 RIDER
                    Hey -- sorry.
          
          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
          
                                 KAT
                    Leave it 
          
          He persists.
          
                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
          
          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.
          
          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
          
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Did you change your hair?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    No.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You might wanna think about it
          
          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
          
          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
          
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
          
                                 BOY
                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Awesome shoes.
          
          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.
          
          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
          
          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I don't think so, ma'am
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
          
          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
          
          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
          
          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I missed you.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    With the teeth of your zipper?
          
          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You the new guy?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So they tell me...
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.
          
          They head out of the office
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    North, actually.  How'd you   ?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thirty-two.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Get out!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    How many people go here?
          
                                 MICHAEL

          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    We've got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don't 
                    bother.
          
          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader 
          splendor.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                    Those 're your cowboys.
          
          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys  
          walk by.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That I'm used to.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.
          
          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.

          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them

                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I 
                    mean.
          
          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.

          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the

          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of

          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO

          without a look.

                    I could start with your haircut, but it 
                    doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that's an impossibility.

          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that 
                    does it for our analysis of The Old Man 
                    and the Sea.  Any other comments?

          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.

                    This book is about a guy and his 
                    fishing habit.  Not exactly a crucial

                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.

                    hag who has no friends?
          
          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.
          
          Really gets fired up now
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess the school board thinks because 
                    Hemingway's male and an asshole, he's 
                    worthy of our time

                    Expressing my opinion is not a

                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today's 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you're

                    I still maintain that he kicked himself 
                    in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.

                    term used most often.
          
          She grimaces, as if she's referring to a medical condition.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                           (continuing)
                    You might want to work on that
          
          Kat rises from her chair with a plastic smile matching the 
          counselor's.
          
                                 KAT
                    As always, thank you for your excellent 
                    guidance.
          
          INT. SOPHOMORE ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Bianca ignores the droning teacher as she writes a note in 
          big flowing handwriting.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                    I realize the language of Mr. 
                    Shakespeare makes him a bit daunting, 
                    but I'm sure you're all doing your best.
          
          Bianca folds the note and passes it behind her with a flip 
          of her hair to CHASTITY.  Chastity opens the note and reads:
          
          INSERT - "JOEY DORSEY SAID HI TO ME IN THE HALL! OH! MY  
          GOD!"
          
          Chastity frowns to herself.
          
                                 TEACHER (0.S.)
                           (continuing)
                    Ms. Stratford, do you care to comment 
                    on what you've read so far?
          
          Bianca looks up and smiles the smile of Daddy's little girl.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Not really.
          
          The teacher shakes her head, but lets it go.
          
          MANDELLA. a waif-like senior girl who sits off to the side 
          trying to slit her wrist with the plastic spiral on her 
          notebook, looks up and raises her hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Mandella -- since you're assisting us, 
                    you might as well comment.  I'm assuming 
                    you read the assignment.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Uh, yeah, I read it all
          
                                 TEACHER
                    The whole play^
          
                                 MANDELIA
                    The whole folio.  All the plays.
          
                                 TEACHER
                           (disbelieving)
                    You've read every play by William 
                    Shakespeare?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Haven't you?
          
          She raises a challenging eyebrow.  The stunned teacher 
          doesn't answer and goes to call on the next student.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - DAY
          
          Mandella and Kat sit down in the quiet corner. They are 
          eating a carton of yogurt with gusto.
          
                                 MANDELLA
          
          Your sister is so amazingly without.  She'll never read him.  
          She has no idea.
          
          Kat attacks
          
                                 KAT
                    The fact that you're cutting gym so you 
                    can T.A. Sophomore English just to hear 
                    his name, is a little without in itself 
                    if you ask me.
          
          Kat's attention is caught by Patrick as he walks by with his 
          friends, lighting up a cigarette.  Mandella notices her 
          staring.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who's that?
          
                                 KAT
                    Patrick Verona   Random skid.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone 
                    for a year? I heard he was doing porn 
                    movies.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm sure he's completely incapable of 
                    doing anything that interesting.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    He always look so
          
                                 KAT
                    Block E?
          
          Kat turns back to face Mandella and forces her yogurt into 
          Mandella's hand.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a 
                    very slow way to die.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Just a little.
          
          She eats.  Kat sees her wrist
          
                                 KAT
                    What's this?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    An attempted slit.
          
          Kat stares at her, expressionless.
          
                                 KAT
                    I realize that the men of this fine 
                    institution are severely lacking, but 
                    killing yourself so you can be with 
                    William Shakespeare is beyond the scope 
                    of normal teenage obsessions.  You're 
                    venturing far past daytime talk show 
                    fodder and entering the world of those 
                    who need very expensive therapy.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    But imagine the things he'd say during 
                    sex.
          
          Thinks a minute
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, say you do it.  You kill 
                    yourself, you end up in wherever you end 
                    up and he's there.  Do you really think 
                    he's gonna wanna dace a ninety pound 
                    compulsive who failed volleyball?
          
          Mandella's attention is struck by Bianca
          
          ACROSS THE COURTYARD
          
          As she and Chastity parade by Joey and his COHORTS   One of 
          the cohorts elbows Joey.
          
                                 COHORT
                    Virgin alert.
          
          Joey looks up and smiles at Bianca.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' good, ladies.
          
          Bianca smiles her coyest of smiles.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA Still watching.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Tragic.
          
          Doesn't respond
          
          ANOTHER ANGLE
          
          Michael and Cameron observe Joey's leers at Bianca from 
          their bench in another corner. Cowboys eating cue of a can 
          of beans linger on the grass behind them.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why do girls like that always like guys 
                    like that?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Because they're bred to.  Their mothers 
                    liked guys like that, and their 
                    grandmothers before them. Their gene 
                    pool is rarely diluted.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He always have that shit-eating grin?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish 
                    I could say he's a moron, but he's 
                    number twelve in the class.  And a 
                    model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's 
                    rumored to have a big tube sock ad 
                    coming out.
          
          The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their 
          empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries 
          to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    You know French?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You mean I'd get a chance to talk to 
                    her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You could consecrate with her, my 
                    friend.
          
          Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up 
          beside her in his Viper.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (re her dress)
                    The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't 
                    you been reading your Sassy?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, and I noticed the only part of 
                    you featured in your big Kmart spread 
                    was your elbow.  Tough break.
          
                                 JOEY
                           (practically 
                           spitting)
                    They're running the rest of me next 
                    month.
          
          He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart.  
          Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in 
          a convertible.
          
                                 KAT
                    The people at this school are so 
                    incredibly foul.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You could always go with me.  I'm sure 
                    William has some friends.
          
          They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and 
          Chastity as they walk toward the school bus.
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY
          
                                 JOEY
                    Need a ride, ladies?
          
          Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He 
          pulls away with a smile.
          
          BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA
          
          Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's a charming new development
          
          Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the 
          tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car.
          
          As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his 
          moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him
          
                                 KAT
                           (yelling)
                    Remove head from sphincter!  Then 
                    pedal!
          
          Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry 
          at the delay.
          
          Cameron rushes over
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You all right?
          
          He slows to a stop
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Yeah, just a minor encounter with the 
                    shrew.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's her?  Bianca's sister?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
          
          Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's 
          grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint 
          jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK -
          - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot.
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of 
          her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds 
          several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
          
          Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she 
          types.
          
                                 KAT
                    "Undulating with desire, Adrienne 
                    removes her crimson cape, revealing her 
                    creamy --"
          
          WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type 
          obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a 
          doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
          
          I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before 
          Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer.
          
          He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to 
          kiss Sharon on the cheek.
          
                                 SHARON
                    In the microwave.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Kat)
                    Make anyone cry today?
          
                                 KAT
                    Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty.
          
          Bianca walks in.
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    Where've you been?
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (eyeing Walter)
                    Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
          
          She kisses him on the cheek
          
                                 WALTER
                    Hello, precious.
          
          Walter kisses Bianca back as Kat heads up the stairs
          
                                 KAT
                    How touching.
          
          Walter holds up a letter to Kat
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's this?  It says Sarah Lawrence?
          
          Snatches it away from him.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I got in
          
          Sharon looks up from her computer.
          
                                 SHARON
                    What's a synonym for throbbing?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of 
                    the country.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I thought we decided you were going to 
                    school here.  At U of 0.
          
                                 KAT
                    You decided.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Is there even a question that we want 
                    her to stay?
          
          Kat gives Bianca an evil look then smiles sweetly at
          
                                 KAT
                    Ask Bianca who drove her home
          
                                 SHARON
                    Swollen...turgid.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Bianca; upset)
                    Who drove you home?
          
          Bianca glares at Kat then turns to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's 
                    this boy... and I think he might ask...
          
                                 WALTER
                    No! You're not dating until your sister 
                    starts dating.  End of discussion.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What if she never starts dating?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Then neither will you.  And I'll get to 
                    sleep at night.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, 
                    Daddy!
          
                                 KAT
                    This from someone whose diary is 
                    devoted to favorite grooming tips?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Enough!
          
          He pulls out a small tape recorder from his black bag.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Do you know what this is?
          
          He hits the "play' button and SHRIEKS OF PAIN emanate from 
          the tape recorder.
          
          BIANCA AND WALTER
                           (in unison, by 
                           rote)
                    The sound of a fifteen-year-old in 
                    labor.
          
                                 WALTER
                    This is why you're not dating until 
                    your sister does.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But she doesn't want to date.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Exactly my point
          
          His BEEPER goes off and he grabs his bag again
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich 
                    before you women start dilating?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Tumescent!
          
                                 WALTER
                           (to Sharon; as he 
                           leaves)
                    You're not helping.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Cameron sits with an empty chair beside him.  Bianca arrives 
          in a flurry of blonde hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can we make this quick?  Roxanne 
                    Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an 
                    incredibly horrendous public break- up 
                    on the quad.  Again.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, I thought we'd start with 
                    pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
          
          BIANCA
          Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    Okay... then how 'bout we try out some 
                    French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
          
          Bianca smiles slowly
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're asking me out.  That's so cute.  
                    What's your name again?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (embarrassed)
                    Forget it.
          
          Bianca seizes an opportunity.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have 
                    a proper introduction ---
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Cameron.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the 
                    mercy of a particularly hideous breed of 
                    loser.  My sister.  I can't date until 
                    she does.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Seems like she could get a date easy 
                    enough...
          
          She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled.
          
                                 BIANCA
          
          The problem is, she's completely anti-social.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Why?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Unsolved mystery.  She used to be 
                    really popular when she started high 
                    school, then it was just like she got 
                    sick of it or something.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's a shame.
          
          She reaches out and touches his arm
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Gosh, if only we could find Kat a 
                    boyfriend...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Let me see what I can do.
          
          Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is
          
          INT. BIOLOGY CLASS
          
          A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks.  
          Michael and Cameron go for the spleen.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You're in school for one day and you 
                    ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you 
                    have no concept of the high school 
                    social code?
          
          Cameron grins away
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I teach her French, get to know her, 
                    dazzle her with charm and she falls in 
                    love with me.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Unlikely, but even so, she still can't 
                    go out with you.  So what's the
                    point?
          
          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What about him?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (confused)
                    You wanna go out with him?
          
          The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (impatient)
                    No - he could wrangle with the sister.
          
          Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What makes you think he'll do it?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    He seems like he thrives on danger
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard 
                    he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just 
                    got out of Alcatraz...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They always let felons sit in on Honors 
                    Biology?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He 
                    sold his own liver on the black market 
                    so he could buy new speakers.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Forget his reputation.  Do you think 
                    we've got a plan or not?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Did she actually say she'd go out with 
                    you?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's what I just said
          
          Michael processes this.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca, 
                    you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone.  
                    Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I thought you hated those people.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients 
                    when I get to Wall Street.
          
          A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So now all we gotta do is talk to him.
          
          He points to Patrick, who now makes his frog hump another 
          frog, with full-on sound effects.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I'll let you handle that.
          
          INT. WOODSHOP - DAY
          
          Boys and a few stray girls nail their pieces of wood
          
          Michael sits next to PEPE, a Coffee Kid, who holds out his 
          jacket like the men who sell watches in the subway.  Inside 
          several bags of coffee hang from hooks.
          
                                 PEPE
                    Some people like the Colombian, but it 
                    all depends on your acidity preference.  
                    Me?  I prefer East African and 
                    Indonesian.  You start the day with a 
                    Sumatra Boengie or maybe and Ethiopian 
                    Sidamo in your cup, you're that much 
                    farther ahead than someone drinkin' 
                    Cosia Rican or Kona -- you know what I 
                    mean?
          
          Michael nods solemnly.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Patrick sits at a table with Scurvy, making something that 
          looks like a machete out of a two-by-four.
          
          Cameron approaches, full of good-natured farm boy cheer
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hey, there
          
          In response, Patrick brandishes a loud POWER TOOL in his 
          direction.
          
          Cameron slinks away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Later, then. 
          
          Michael watches, shaking his head.
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY
          
          Joey and his pals take turns drawing boobs onto a cafeteria 
          tray with a magic marker.
          
          Michael walks up and sits between them, casual as can be
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Are you lost?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Nope - just came by to chat
          
                                 JOEY
                    We don't chat.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Well, actually, I thought I'd run an 
                    idea by you.  You know, just to see if 
                    you're interested.
          
                                 JOEY
                    We're not.
          
          He grabs Michael by the side of the head, and proceeds to 
          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (grimacing)
                    Hear me out.  You want Bianca don't 
                    you?
          
          Joey sits back and cackles at his drawing.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    But she can't go out with you because 
                    her sister is this insane head case and 
                    no one will go out with her. right?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Does this conversation have a purpose?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    So what you need to do is recruit a guy 
                    who'll go out with her.  Someone who's 
                    up for the job.
          
          Michael points to Patrick, who makes a disgusted face at his 
          turkey pot pie before he rises and throws it at the garbage 
          can, rather than in it.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          That guy?  I heard he ate a live duck once.  Everything but 
          the beak and the feet.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Exactly
          
          Joey turns to look at Michael.
          
                                 JOEY
          
          What's in it for you?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Oh, hey, nothin' man   Purely good will 
                    on my part.
          
          He rises to leave and turns to the others.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                           (continuing)
                    I have a dick on my face, don't I? 
          
          INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Michael stands at the sink, trying to scrub Joey's artwork 
          off his face as Cameron watches.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got him involved?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when 
                    you let the enemy think he's 
                    orchestrating the battle, you're in a 
                    position of power. We let him pretend 
                    he's calling the shots, and while he's 
                    busy setting up the plan, you have time 
                    to woo Bianca.
          
          Cameron grins and puts an arm around him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You're one brilliant guy
          
          Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in.
          
                                 MICHAEL
          
          Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but 
          it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who 
          Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
          
          Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a 
          manly way for the others, now watching.
          
          INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY
          
          Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is 
          smoking.
          
                                 KAT
                    So he has this huge raging fit about 
                    Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to 
                    his male-dominated, puking frat boy, 
                    number one golf team school. I have no 
                    say at all.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William would never have gone to a 
                    state school.
          
                                 KAT
                    William didn't even go to high school
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    That's never been proven
          
                                 KAT
                    Neither has his heterosexuality.
          
          Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to 
          stub out Mandella's cigarette. 
          
                                 KAT
                           (continuing)
                    I appreciate your efforts toward a 
                    speedy death, but I'm consuming.
                           (pointing at her 
                           food)
                    Do you mind?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Does it matter?
          
                                 KAT
                    If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any 
                    school you want, precious.  Don't forget 
                    your tiara."
          
          They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the 
          counter to place his order.
          
          Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Janice Parker told me he was a roadie 
                    for Marilyn Manson.
          
          Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Janice Parker is an idiot
          
          INT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
          
          Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (looking at chart)
                    I don't understand, Patrick.  You 
                    haven't done anything asinine this week.  
                    Are you not feeling well?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Touch of the flu.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    I'm at a loss, then.  What should we 
                    talk about? Your year of absence?
          
          He smiles his charming smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How 'bout your sex life?
          
          She tolerates his comment with her withering glance.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Why don't we discuss your driving need 
                    to be a hemorrhoid?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What's to discuss?
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, 
                    and as far as I can tell, you're only 
                    slightly psychotic -- so why is it that 
                    you're such a fuck-up?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Well, you know -- there's the prestige 
                    of the job title... and the benefits 
                    package is pretty good...
          
          The bell RINGS.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Fine.  Go do something repugnant and 
                    give us something to talk about next 
                    week.
          
          INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY
          
          Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various 
          desks.
          
          Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to 
          get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Look, it's really easy.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, 
                    sister.
          
          Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (rotely)
                    It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not 
                    related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a 
                    political figure.  I do not live in 
                    South Africa.  My parents just spent a 
                    few too many acid trips thinking they 
                    were revolutionaries.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                    But you freed our people
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Your "people" are white, suburban high 
                    school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I 
                    have not freed you, Trevor.
                           (grabbing his arm 
                           dramatically)
                    Only you can free yourself.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as 
          can be
          
                                 BIANCA
                    C'esc ma tete. This is my head
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Right.  See?  You're ready for the 
                    quiz.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I don't want to know how to say that 
                    though.  I want to know useful things.  
                    Like where the good stores are.  How 
                    much does champagne cost?  Stuff like 
                    Chat.  I have never in my life had to 
                    point out my head to someone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    That's because it's such a nice one.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Forget French.
          
          She shuts her book and puts on a seductive smile
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    How is our little Find the Wench A Date 
                    plan progressing?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Well, there's someone I think might be 
                    --
          
          Bianca's eyes light up
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Show me
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca lean against the wall -inconspicuously. 
          Bianca plays it cool.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Give me a sign when he walks by.  And 
                    don't point.
          
          The bell RINGS.  Kids flood past.  Then Patrick saunters by 
          with Scurvy.  Cameron nudges Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    There.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where?
          
          Out of desperation, Cameron awkwardly lunges across 
          Patrick's path.  Patrick shoves him back against the wall 
          without a thought.  Cameron lands in a THUD at Bianca's 
          feet.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I guess he didn't see me 
                           (calling after 
                           Patrick) 
                                     Some other time --
          
          Bianca watches Patrick, a wicked gleam in  her eye.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    My God, he's repulsive. He's so 
                    perfect!
          
          INT. GYM CLASS - DAY 
          
          Several volleyball games are being played.
          
          Joey and a member of his hulking entourage, approach 
          Patrick, who still manages to look cool, even in gym 
          clothes.  They pull him aside roughly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (shrugging them 
                           off)
                    What?
          
          Joey points
          
          JOEY See that girl?
          
          Patrick follows his line of vision to Kat as she spikes the 
          ball into some poor cowboy's face.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah
          
                                 JOEY 
                    What do you think?
          
          Kat wins the game and high fives the others, who are scared 
          of her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Two legs, nice rack...
          
                                 JOEY
                    Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out 
                    with her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You just said
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need money to take a girl out
          
                                 JOEY
                    But you'd go out with her if you had 
                    the cake?
          
          Patrick stares at Joey deadpan.  His dislike for the guy 
          obvious.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    Yeah, I'd take her to Europe if I had 
                    the plane.
          
          Joey smiles.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, 
                    you do the honors.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're gonna pay me to take out some 
                    girl?
          
                                 JOEY
                    I can't date her sister until that one 
                    gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch.  
                    She doesn't want a boyfriend.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    How much?
          
                                 JOEY
          
          Twenty bucks each time you take her out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I can't take a girl like that out on 
                    twenty bucks.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Fine, thirty.
          
          Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Take it or leave it.  This isn't a 
                    negotiation.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fifty, and you've got your man.
          
          Patrick walks away with a smile
          
          EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY
          
          Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice 
          session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over 
          the field.
          
          Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette 
          dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him.
          
          MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                           (proudly) 
                    Good run, Stratford.
          
          Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick 
          hops down to follow.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Hey. Girlie.
          
          Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (smiles brightly)
                    Sweating like a pig, actually.  And 
                    yourself?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    There's a way to get a guy's attention.
          
                                 KAT
                    My mission in life.
          
          She stands there undaunted, hand on hip.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, 
                    you see, it worked.  The world makes 
                    sense again.
          
          Patrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Pick you up Friday, then
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, right.  Friday.
          
          PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone
          
                                 PATRICK
                    The night I take you to places you've 
                    never been before.  And back.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside?  
                    Do you even know my name, screwboy?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know a lot more than that
          
          Kat stares at him.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Doubtful.  Very doubtful.
          
          She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (calling after her)
                    You're no bargain either, sweetheart.
          
          Scurvy appears at his side
          
                                 SCURVY
                    So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a 
                    new Blaupunkt.
          
          ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He took the bait.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, 
          and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon.
          
          She wacks Bianca away.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Have you ever considered a new look? I 
                    mean, seriously, you could have some 
                    potential buried under all this 
                    hostility.
          
          Kat pushes past her into the hallway.
          
                                 KAT
                    I have the potential to smack the crap 
                    out of you if you don't get out of my 
                    way.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you at least start wearing a bra?
          
          Kat SLAMS her door in response.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit
          
          SCURVY You up for a burger?
          
          Patrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Kat stands at her locker, gathering her books.  Patrick 
          appears at her side, smiling.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          Kat doesn't answer
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    You hate me don't you?
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't really think you warrant that 
                    strong an emotion.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at 
                    the track with me.
          
                                 KAT 
                    And why would I do that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, 
                    you with money in your eyes, me with my 
                    hand on your ass...
          
                                 KAT
                    You -- covered in my vomit.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Seven-thirty?
          
          She slams her locker shut and walks away
          
          EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - NIGHT
          
          Kat emerges from a music store carrying a bag of CDs in  her 
          teeth, and fumbling through her purse with both hands.  She 
          finds her keys and pulls them out with a triumphant tug.
          
          She looks up and finds Patrick sitting on the hood of her 
          car
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nice ride. Vintage fenders.
          
          Kat takes the bag out of her mouth.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Are you following me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I was in the laundromat. I saw your 
                    car. Thought I'd say hi.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Hi
          
          She gets in and starts the car.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not a big talker, are you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Depends on the topic. My fenders don't 
                    really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
          
          She starts to pull out, and is blocked by Joey's Viper, 
          which pulls up perpendicular to her rear and parks.
          
          Joey and his groupies emerge and head for the liquor store
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- do you mind?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Not at all
          
          They continue on into the store.  Kat stares at them in 
          disbelief...
          
          Then BACKS UP
          
          Her vintage fenders CRASH into the door of Joey's precious 
          Viper.
          
          Patrick watches with a delighted grin Joey races out of the 
          liquor store.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing) 
                    You fucking bitch!
          
          Kat pulls forward and backs into his car again.  Smiling 
          sweetly.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Walter paces as Kat sits calmly on the couch.
          
                                 WALTER
                    My insurance does not cover PMS
          
                                 KAT
                    Then tell them I had a seizure.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You 
                    punishing me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I thought you were punishing me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Why can't we agree on this?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because you're making decisions for me.
          
                                 WALTER
                    As a parent, that's my right
          
                                 KAT
                    So what I want doesn't matter?
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're eighteen.  You don't know what 
                    you want.  You won't know until you're 
                    forty-five and you don't have it.

                           (emphatic)
                    I want to go to an East Coast school! I 
                    want you to trust me to make my own 
                    choices.  I want --
          
          Walter's BEEPER goes off
          
                                 WALTER
                    Christ!  I want a night to go by that 
                    I'm not staring a contraction in the 
                    face.
          
          He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing 
          Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him.
          
                                 JOEY
                    When I shell out fifty, I expect 
                    results.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm on it
          
                                 JOEY
                    Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't 
                    count as a date.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I got her under control. She just acts 
                    crazed in public to keep up the image.
          
          Joey sees through the bluff
          
                                 JOEY
                    Let me put it to you this way, if you 
                    don't get any action, I don't get any 
                    action.  So get your ass on hers by the 
                    end of the week.
          
          Joey starts to walk off
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I just upped my price
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (turning)
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    A hundred bucks a date.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Forget it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget her sister, then.
          
          Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker,  
          then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing 
          scowl.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better hope you're as smooth as you 
                    think you are, Verona.
          
          Patrick takes the money with a smile.

          Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance?
          
          Bianca glares at him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    A "copine" is someone you can count on.  
                    An "ami" is someone who makes promises 
                    he can't keep.
          
          Cameron closes the French book
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You got something on your mind?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I counted on you to help my cause. You 
                    and that thug are obviously failing.  
                    Aren't we ever going on our date?
          
          He melts
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You have my word.  As a gentleman
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're sweet.
          
          She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches 
          her toss her hair back
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (appreciative)
                    How do you get your hair to look like 
                    that?

                    without the diffuser attachment.
          
          Cameron nods with interest.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You know, I read an article about that.
          
          Bianca looks surprised.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did?

          Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and 
          Cameron cower in the corner, watching him.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (without turning 
                           around) 
                    Say it
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (clearing his 
                           throat) 
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Whatever the hell it is you're standin' 
                    there waitin' to say.
          
          Cameron bravely steps forward
          
                                 CAMERON
                    We wanted to talk to you about the 
                    plan.
          
          Patrick turns toward them.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    What plan?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    The situation is, my man Cameron here 
                    has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What is it with this chick?  She have 
                    three tits?
          
          Cameron starts to object, but Michael holds up a hand.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I think I speak correctly when I say 
                    that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than 
                    say -- Joey Dorsey's.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm 
                    just in this for the cash.
          
          Cameron starts choking at the thought of Joey plowing his 
          beloved Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    That's where we can help you.  With 
                    Kat.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    So Dorsey can get the girl?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the 
                    big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set 
                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.
          
          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You two are gonna help me tame the wild 
                    beast?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (grinning) 
                    We're your guys.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    And he means that strictly in a non- 
                    prison-movie type of way.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Yeah -- we'll see.
          
          He swings the door open and exits, leaving Michael and 
          Cameron grinning at each other.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    We're in.

          night bash at his abode.  Casual attire".
          
          Michael holds the invitation up to Cameron.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    This is it.  A golden opportunity. 
                    Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    In that case, we'll need to make it a 
                    school-wide blow out.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Will Bogey get bent?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself 
                    with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.

                    Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if 
                    you won't be there.

                    I really, really, really wanna go, but 
                    I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem 
                    to be goin' for him.
          
          He fishes.

                                 BIANCA
                    Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of 
                    Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm 
                    pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex 
                    tendencies.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So that's the kind of guy she likes? 
                    Pretty ones?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say 
                    is that she'd dip before dating a guy 
                    that smokes.
          
          Cameron furiously takes notes
          
                                 CAMERON
                    All right.  What else is she partial 
                    to?
          
          INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
          Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies.
          
          He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the 
          bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Lou, it's okay.  They're with me.
          
          Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our 
          two non-deviants pass through.
          
          Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    What've you got for me?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I've retrieved certain pieces of 
                    information on Miss Katarina Stratford I 
                    think you'll find helpful.
          
          Cameron pulls out a piece of paper.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Patrick)
          
          One question before we start -- should you be drinking 
          alcohol when you don't have a liver?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?!
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Good enough.
          
          Cameron looks up at Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Number one.  She hates smokers
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    It's a lung cancer issue
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Her favorite uncle
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Dead at forty-one.
          
          Patrick sits up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Are you telling me I'm a - 
                           (spits the word 
                           out)
                    "non-smoker"?
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Just for now.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat 
                    likes -- pretty guys.
          
          This is met with silence.  Then:
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What?  You don't think I'm pretty?
          
          Michael smacks Cameron
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    He's pretty!
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Okay!  I wasn't sure
          
          Cameron goes back to the list.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist 
                    prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of 
                    the indie-rock persuasion".
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what does that give me?  I'm 
                    supposed to buy her some noodles and a 
                    book and sit around listening to chicks 
                    who can't play their instruments?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Ever been to Club Skunk?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow 
                    night.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Don't make me do it, man
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Assail your ears for one night.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's her favorite band.
          
          Patrick groans
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I also retrieved a list of her most 
                    recent CD purchases, courtesy of 
                    American Express.
          
          He hands it over.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Michael -- did you get this information 
                    "illegally"?
          
          Michael puts a finger to his lips.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    I prefer to think of it simply as an 
                    alternative to what the law allows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I'm likin' you guys better
          
          He looks down at the list of CDs.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    This is really music?
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT
          
          MUSIC BLARES in a room with minimalist decor splashed with 
          indie rock band posters and flyers.
          
          Kat and Mandella dance as they dress and apply make-up 
          Bianca enters, interrupting their fun.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can you turn down the Screaming 
                    Menstrual Bitches?  I'm trying to study.
          
          Kat doesn't move, so Bianca crosses to the stereo, turning 
          down the volume.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Don't tell me you're actually going 
                    out?  On a school night, no less.
          
          Kat shoots her a glare
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing; 
                           excited)
                    Oh my God, does this mean you're 
                    becoming normal?
          
                                 KAT
                    It means that Gigglepuss is playing at 
                    Club Skunk and we're going.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (disappointed)
                    Oh, I thought you might have a date
                           (beat)
                    I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, 
                    but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's 
                    party Saturday night?
          
                                 KAT
                    What do you think?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I think you're a freak.  I think you do 
                    this to torture me.  And I think you 
                    suck.
          
          She smiles sweetly and shuts the door behind her.   Kat 
          doesn't bat an eye.  She grabs her purse and opens the door
          
                                 KAT 
                    Let's hit it.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          A happy black and white neon skunk sprays fine mist on the 
          line of kids below.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Kat and Mandella walk in, Mandella nervously pulling out her 
          fake ID.  The giant, afroed bouncer, BRUCE, looks typically 
          mono-syllabic.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (whispering to Kat) 
                    You think this'll work?
          
                                 KAT 
                    No fear.
          
          They approach Bruce.  Kat puts on her happy, shiny face
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Hello!  We'd like two for Gigglepuss!
          
          Bruce looks the girls up and down.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    I can count.
          
          He looks at their IDs. Mandella gently moves Kat aside, 
          wearing a face that could only be described as "I AM a 
          Victoria's Secret model."
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    I'll bet you can..
          
          She sticks out her chest and licks her lips.  Bruce stares 
          at her deadpan and hands her back the IDs.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Go ahead.
                           (to Mandella)
                    And you
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (all come hither)
                    Yes?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Take it easy on the guys in there.
          
          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.
          
          INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT
          
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy's inside pocket.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Next time, leave the Bic at home, 
                    Skippy.
          
                                 SKIPPY
                    It's a bottle opener.
          
          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Verona, my man.
          
          They shake.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Always a pleasure, Brucie.
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss 
                    fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen 
                    belly-button ring for you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of 
                    minors come in?
          
                                 BRUCE
                    Never
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. 
                    The other one kinda short and 
                    undersexed?
          
                                 BRUCE 
                    Just sent 'em through.
          
          Patrick starts to go in
          
                                 BRUCE 
                           (continuing)
                    Hey -- what happened to that chick you 
                    brought last time?  The one with the 
                    snake?
          
          Patrick laughs and goes into the club
          
          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.
          
          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.
          
                                 LEAD SINGER
                    Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and 
                    we're from Olympia.
          
          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.
          
                                 BOY (0.S.)
                    Pet my kitty!
          
                                 LEAD SINGER 
                    Meow
          
          They rev into their next song. 
          
          NEAR THE STAGE  
          
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be 
          having a better time.
          
          AT THE BAR
          
          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.
          
          HIS POV
          
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.
          
          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!
          
          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR
          
          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing to 
                           herself) 
                    Shit
          
          She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed.
          
          The bartender arrives
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (shouting) 
                    What can I get you?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Two waters.
          
          She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.
          
          She walks up to Patrick.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing) 
                    You're not fooling anyone.
          
          Patrick looks at her, surprised
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    hey.  Great show, huh?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
          
          If you're planning on asking me out you might as well get it 
          over with.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    Excuse me?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    That's what you want, isn't it?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling; gesturing 
                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it 
                    for me.
          
          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling)
                    You're not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.
          
          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    I know.  I quit.
          
          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Oh, really?
          
          He motions toward the stage
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they're right up 
                    there.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know who The Raincoats are?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Why, don't you?
          
          She's completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I've never 
                    seen you look like that
          
          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.
          
          His cocky side is back in a flash
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.
          
          At that moment, the band starts another SONG
          
                                 KAT 
                           (yelling) 
                    What?
          
          The bartender approaches.
          
          BARTENDER 
                           (to Kat, yelling) 
                    You forgot to pay!
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (yelling) 
                    I got it, Rick.
          
          He tosses some bills on the bar
          
          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.
          
          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can't hear a word he's saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.
          
          Patrick smiles.  She didn't say no this time.
          
          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT
          
          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                    What'd he say?
          
                                 KAT 
                    Who cares?
          
          Mandella watches Kat as she stares after Patrick
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Has he importun'd you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?
          
          Kat glances sharply at her.
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor 
                    of romance.  You're the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.
          
          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Gigglepuss was so beyond.
          
          Mandella nods.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    They were.  I only wish William could 
                    have been here to witness the rebirth of 
                    punk rock with us.
          
          Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the 
          car.
          
                                 KAT
                    So true.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          Cameron and Michael are at Michael's locker.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    So, then she says that she almost 
                    didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that 
                    dress because she thought she was 
                    mixing, you know, genres. And the fact 
                    that I noticed -- and I'm quoting here -
                    "really meant something."
          
          Cameron looks At Michael expectantly
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    You told me that part already.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Hell, I've just been going over the 
                    whole thing in my head and -
          
          Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder.  
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Hey.  Dingo Boingo
          
          Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around 
          slowly
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing; to 
                           Michael)
                    I hear you're helpin' Verona.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
          
                                 JOEY 
                    You and Verona?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    What?  We took bathes together when we 
                    were kids.
          
          It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.  Joey eyes him then 
          turns to Cameron.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's your gig in all this?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'm just the new guy.
          
          Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his 
          shirt and twisting it.
          
                                 JOEY
                    You better not fuck this up.  I'm 
                    heavily invested.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Hey -- it's all for the higher good 
                    right?
          
          Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker 
          for good measure, as he walks away-
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Is it about me?
          
          EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and 
          annoyed.
          
          The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    You're completely demented.
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (cheery)
                    See you next week!
          
          Kat stands and Patrick sees her.
          
          Miss Perky watches in horror
          
          MISS PERKY
          You two know each other?
          
                                 PATRICK/KAT 
                    Yeah/No.
          
          Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Patrick)
                    Dear God, stay away from her.  If you 
                    two ever decided to breed, evil would 
                    truly walk the earth.
          
          Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then 
          smiles-
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          The lights are on, illuminating the yard
          
          INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.  MUSIC is 
          blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    She's obviously not going.
          
          INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak 
          past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand.
          
          FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze.
          
          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I --
          
                                 WALTER
                    And where're you going?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Otherwise known as an orgy?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria 
                    Steinem" over there isn't going --
          
          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.
          
          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?
          
          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, people expect me to be there!
          
                                 WALTER
                    If Kat's not going, you're not going.
          
          Bianca turns to Kat, eyes ablaze
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You're ruining my life'  Because you 
                    won't be normal, I can't be normal.
          
                                 KAT 
                    What's normal?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but 
                    you're too busy listening to Bitches Who 
                    Need Prozac to know that.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What's a Bogey Lowenstein?
          
          Kat takes off her earphones, ready to do battle
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Can't you forget for just one night 
                    that you're completely wretched?
          
                                 KAT
                    At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked 
                    hedge-pig.
          
          Bianca tosses her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like I'm supposed to know what that 
                    even means.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard 
                    of him?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's 
                    boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not 
                    allowed to go out, I should obsess over 
                    a dead guy, too.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Girls
          
          Kat stares Bianca down
          
                                 KAT
                    I know about the goddamn party.  I'm 
                    going.
          
          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.
          
          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, God.  It's starting.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    It's just a party. Daddy.
          
          Walter looks dazed.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Wear the belly before you go.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, no!
          
                                 WALTER
                    Just for a minute
          
          He rushes to a cupboard and pulls out a padded faux-
          pregnancy belly.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I want you to realize the weight of 
                    your decisions.
          
          He hangs the belly on her as she stands mortified.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You are so completely unbalanced.
          
                                 KAT 
                    Can we go now?

                           (to Bianca)
                    Promise me you won't talk to any boys 
                    unless your sister is present.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Why?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Because she'll scare them away.
          
          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall 
          table and a sweater from the coat rack. She flings open the 
          door and...
          
          There stands Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Nine-thirty right?
          
          Kat's in shock
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I'm early.
          
          She holds up her keys
          
                                 KAT 
                    I'm driving.
          
          He peeks in behind her.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                    Who knocked up your sister?
          
          INT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a 
          pro, handing out cigars and martinis.
          
                                 BOGEY
                    Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the 
                    right, shots in the kitchen.
          
          The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat 
          pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and 
          hollering within the jock crowd.
          
          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the 
          doorway.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat
          
          Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his 
          forehead.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline 
                    just recede?
          
          He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's 
          already walking away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Where ya goin?
          
                                 KAT
                    Away.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Your sister here?
          
          Kat's face shows utter hatred
          
                                 KAT 
                    Leave my sister alone.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (smirking) 
                    And why would I do that?
          
          A RUCKUS sounds from the next room
          
                                 JOCK 
                    A fight!
          
          The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash 
          their cupfuls on each other.
          
                                 COFFEE KID #1
                    That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you 
                    Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe.
          
          Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to 
          watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into 
          the kitchen.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Just who I was looking for.
          
          He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out
          
                                 KAT 
                                 BIANCA
          
          Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat
          
          A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts 
          another.
          
          GUY
          Drink up, sister.
          
          Patrick walks up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's this?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (mocking)
                    "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that 
                    what you're supposed to do at a party?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I say, do what you wanna do.
          
                                 KAT
                    Funny, you're the only one
          
          She downs another.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his 
          beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and 
          dishes dirt simultaneously.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (high-fiving a 
                           jock)
                    Moose, my man! 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters 
                    have already started calling.
          
          Cameron nods intently
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing; 
                           grabbing his belt)
                    Yo, Clem. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new 
                    Leanne Rimes. 
                           (with a Jamaican 
                           swagger)
                    Ziggy, peace, bra. 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Prefers a water pipe, but has been 
                    known to use a bong.
          
          Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, 
          and points Cameron's body in her direction.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Follow the love, man
          
          ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Where did he go?  He was just here.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Who?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Joey.
          
          Cameron walks over.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Evening, ladies.
          
          Bianca turns and graces him with a pained smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Looks like things worked out tonight, 
                    huh?
          
          Bianca ignores the question and tries to pawn him off
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You know Chastity?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I believe we share an art instructor
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Great
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Would you mind getting me a drink, 
                    Cameron?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Certainly
                    Pabst?  Old Milwaukee? RaiJieer?
          
          Bianca gives him a tense smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Surprise me.
          
          He heads for the kitchen.  Joey walks up and grabs her 
          around the waist.
          
          She giggles as he picks her up and carries her off -- just 
          as Cameron returns, a beer -- complete with a napkin and 
          straw -- in his hand.
          
          Chastity glares with a jealous fury after Bianca and Joey, 
          then gives Cameron the once-over and walks away.
          
          Michael appears.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy 
                    just picks up a girl and carries her 
                    away while you're talking to her?
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're 
                    making progress.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No, I ' m not.
          
          He smacks himself in the head
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    She used me!  She wants to go out with 
                    Dorsey.  Not me.  I'm an idiot!
          
          Michael pats him on the shoulder.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    At least you're self-aware
          
          BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
          
          Kat and a crowd of White Rastas and Cowboys stand in a 
          drunken group hug singing "I Shot the Sheriff".  Kat has 
          another shot glass in hand.
          
          Patrick is showing a scar to an inebriated, enraptured 
          cheerleader.  He looks up at Kat and smiles meets his eyes 
          then looks away.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca stands next to Joey, sipping from her beer
          
                                 JOEY
                    So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog 
                    thing going -- and the tube sock gig " 
                    that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up 
                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Queen Harry?
          
                                 JOEY
                    It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, 
                    like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
          
          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting 
          difficult.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Neat...
          
                                 JOEY
                    My agent says I've got a good shot at 
                    being the Prada guy next year.
          
          He looks over her shoulder and waves at someone.  Bianca 
          takes the opportunity to escape.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'll be right back.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca shuts the door and leans on it with a sigh.  Chastity 
          applies lip-gloss in the mirror.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He practically proposed when he found 
                    out we had the same dermatologist. I 
                    mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, 
                    but he's not exactly relevant party 
                    conversation.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Is he oily or dry?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Combination.  I don't know -- I thought 
                    he'd be different.  More of a 
                    gentleman...
          
          Chastity rolls her eyes
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Bianca, I don't think the highlights of 
                    dating Joey Dorsey are going to include 
                    door-opening and coat-holding.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're 
                    supposed to want to go out with are the 
                    ones we actually want to go out with, 
                    you know?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    All I know is -- I'd give up my private 
                    line to go out with a guy like Joey.
          
          There's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very 
          drunken Kat.
          
                                 KAT
                    Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need 
                    to tell you --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (cutting her off)
                    I really don't think I need any social 
                    advice from you right now.
          
          Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit
          
          INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - LATER 
          
          Patrick tries to remove a shot glass from Kat's hand.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Maybe you should let me have it.
          
          Kat is fierce in her refusal to let go
          
                                 KAT
                    I want another one
          
          Joey enters, grabbing Patrick by the shoulder, distracting 
          him from his task.
          
                                 JOEY
                    My man
          
          As Patrick turns, Kat breaks free and dives into the sea of 
          dancing people in the dining room.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (annoyed)
                    It's about time.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    A deal's a deal.
          
          He peels off some bills
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    How'd you do it?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 JOEY
                    Get her to act like a human
          
          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She's almost burlesque.
          
          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on
          
          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.
          
          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Okay?
          
                                 KAT
                    I'm fine. I'm
          
          She tries to push him away, but staggers when she does grabs  
          her again, bracing her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You're not okay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I just need to lie down for awhile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to 
                    sleep
          
                                 KAT
                    I know, just let me sleep
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What if you have a concussion? My dog 
                    went to sleep with a concussion and woke 
                    up a vegetable. Not that I could tell 
                    the difference...
          
          She tries to sit on the floor
          
                                 KAT
                    Okay, I'll just sleep but stay awake, 
                    okay?
          
          He pulls her back to her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    C'mon, let's walk
          
          INT. BOGEY'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          As Patrick walks Kat through the dining room, Cameron  grabs 
          his arm.
          
          CAMERON We need to talk.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron, I'm a little busy
          
                                 CAMERON
                    It's off. The whole thing.
          
          Kat slides down to the floor and Patrick struggles to  get h 
          back on her feet.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What 're you talking about?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She's partial to Joey, not me
          
          Patrick doesn't have time for this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cameron -- do you like the girl?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Sure
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (impatient)
                    Then, go get her
          
          Patrick continues walking an oblivious Kat outside. Cameron 
          stands there, unsure how to make use of this advice
          
          EXT. BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick marches Kat around the yard, holding her up
          
                                 KAT
                    This is so patronizing.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Leave it to you to use big words when 
                    you're shitfaced.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why 're you doing this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I told you
          
                                 KAT
                    You don't care if I die
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Sure, I do
          
                                 KAT
                    Why?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because then I'd have to start taking 
                    out girls who like me.
          
                                 KAT
                    Like you could find one
          
                                 PATRICK
                    See that?  Who needs affection when 
                    I've got blind hatred?
          
                                 KAT
                    Just let me sit down.
          
          He walks her over to the swingset and plops her down in a 
          swing, moving her hands to hang onto the chains.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    How's that?
          
          She sits and looks at him for a moment with a smile. Then 
          FALLS over backward.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jesus.  You're like a weeble
          
          Patrick rushes to right her, then starts pushing her on the 
          swing to keep her entertained.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Why'd you let him get to you?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who? 
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Dorsey.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate him.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big 
                    deal to get you to mainline tequila. You 
                    don't seem like the type.
          
                                 KAT
                           (holding up a 
                           drunken head)
                    Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can 
                    be "cool"?  You don't think I can be 
                    "laid back" like everyone else?
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (slightly 
                           sarcastic)
                    I thought you were above all that
          
                                 KAT
                    You know what they say
          
          He stops the swing
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No. What do they say?
          
          Kat is asleep, her head resting against the swing's chains.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Shit!
          
          He drags her to her feet and starts singing loudly.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Jingle Bells! Jingle Belles! Wake up 
                    damn it!
          
          He sits her down on the slide and shakes her like a rag 
          doll.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Kat! Wake up!  
          
                                 KAT
                           (waking)
                    What?
          
          He sighs with relief.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you were...
          
          They share some meaningful eye contact. And then she PUKES 
          on his shoes.
          
          INT. BOGEY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat washes her face and grabs a bottle of Scope, taking a 
          big swig.
          
          A KNOCK sounds at the door
          
                                 KAT
                    Go away
          
          Bianca opens the door and looks at her sister with the 
          smuggest of all possible grins.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Dinner taste better on the way out?
          
          Gives her a "don't even start" look.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I don't get you.  You act like you're 
                    too good for any of this, and then you 
                    go totally apeshit when you get here.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're welcome.
          
          She pushes past her and leaves the bathroom.
          
          KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kat's in the driver's seat.  Patrick leans in and takes the 
          keys out of the ignition.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Cute
          
          BOGEY LOWENSTEIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Kids loiter on the lawn.  Bianca and Chastity walk outside 
          Joey catches up to them.
          
                                 JOEY
                    A bunch of us are going to Jaret's 
                    house.  Wanna come?
          
          Chastity looks at Bianca, who wears a pained expression.  
          She looks at her watch.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have to be home in twenty minutes.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (eagerly, to Joey)
                    I don't have to be home 'til two.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Then, c'mon.
                           (to Bianca)
                    Maybe next time --
          
          They head back into the party, leaving an astonished Bianca
          
          Cameron exits the party and stops when he sees Bianca 
          standing alone.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (slightly 
                           accusatory)
                    Have fun tonight?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Tons
          
          He starts to walk on
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Cameron?
          
          He stops. She gives him a helpless smile.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    Do you think you could give me a ride 
                    home?
          
          INT. KAT'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm driving, so I get to pick the 
                    tunes.
          
          She changes it back to her song.
          
                                 KAT
                    It's my car.
          
          He changes it back.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    And I'm in control of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like 
                    them.  I saw you there.
          
          Patrick doesn't have an answer for this, so he let's her 
          listen to her song.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    When you were gone last year -- where 
                    were you?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Busy
          
                                 KAT
                    Were you in jail?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Maybe.
          
                                 KAT
                    No, you weren't
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then why'd you ask?
          
                                 KAT
                    Why'd you lie?
          
          He doesn't answer, but instead, frowns and turns up the 
          music.  She bobs her head drunkenly.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I should do this.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do what?
          
                                 KAT
                    This.
          
          She points to the radio
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Start a band?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (sarcastically)
                    My father wouldn't approve of that that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You don't strike me as the type that 
                    would ask permission.
          
          She turns to look at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, so now you think you know me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I'm gettin' there
          
          Her voice loses it's venom
          
                                 KAT
                    The only thing people know about me is 
                    that I'm "scary".
          
          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          Yeah -- well, I'm no picnic myself.
          
          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they're both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.
          
          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    So what ' s up with your dad?  He a 
                    pain in the ass?
          
                                 KAT
                    He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Who?
          
                                 KAT
                                 BIANCA
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No offense, but you're sister is 
                    without.  I know everyone likes her and 
                    all, but ...
          
          Kat stares at him with new admiration.
          
                                 KAT
                    You know -- you're not as vile as I 
                    thought you were.
          
          She leans drunkenly toward him.
          
          Their faces grow closer as if they're about to kiss And then 
          Patrick turns away
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So, I'll see you in school
          
          Kat stares at him, pissed.  Then gets out of the car, 
          SLAMMING the door shut behind her.
          
          CAMERON'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Bianca and Cameron ride in silence.
          He finally breaks it.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I looked for you back at the party, but 
                    you always seemed to be "occupied".
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (faux-innocence )
                    I was?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You never wanted to go out with 'me, 
                    did you?
          
          Bianca bites her lip.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (reluctant)
                    Well, no...
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Then that's all you had to say.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You always been this selfish?
          
          BIANCA thinks a minute
          
          He pulls up in front of the house
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Just because you're beautiful, doesn't 
                    mean you can treat people like they 
                    don't matter.
          
          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and 
          gives him a kiss on the lips.  He draws back in surprise, 
          then kisses her back.  She smiles, then gets out of the car 
          without another word.
          
          Cameron grins and drives away
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    And I'm back in the saddle.
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat sits at her desk, burying her face in a book as the 
          others enter.  The White Rastas are first.
          
                                 DEREK
                    Kat, my lady, you sway to the rhythm of 
                    my heart.
          
          He grabs her hand and kisses it as she pulls it away.
          
          CLEM, a cowboy, enters, high-fiving Derek with new-found 
          friendliness.
          
                                 CLEM
                    Yippe kai-aye, bra. 
                           (to Kat)
                    Dance for me, cowgirl.
          
          He sits next to Derek
          
                                 CLEM 
                           (continuing)
                    Okay, now tell me again why he didn't 
                    shoot the deputy?
          
                                 DEREK
                    Because the deputy meant him no harm, 
                    my friend.  It was only the sheriff that 
                    was the oppressor.
          
          Joey saunters in and takes his seat.
          
                                 JOEY
                    Kat, babe, you were on fire.
          
          Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    Well now, did everyone have a good 
                    weekend?
          
                                 JOEY 
                    Maybe we should ask Verona
          
          Patrick enters, late, and slinks to his desk.  Kat looks up, 
          down and around, everywhere but at Patrick.
          
          Mrs. Blaise tries to remember what she's supposed to talk 
          about.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Okay then.  Well.
                           (beat)
                    Oh, yes
          
          She clears her throat.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    I'd like you all to write your own 
                    version of Shakespeare's Sonnet #141.
          
          Groans.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, 
                    whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate 
                    on his theme, however. Let's read it 
                    aloud, shall we? Anyone?
          
          The class is frozen in apathy.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Derek?
          
          Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in 
          his seat. Then grins.
          
                                 DEREK 
                           (reading; in his

                    Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom 
                    pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as

                                 MANDELLA
                    You went to the party?  I thought we 
                    were officially opposed to suburban 
                    social activity.

                    I didn't have a choice.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat 
                    and what have you done with her?
          
                                 KAT
                    I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.

                    You didn't

                    I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected.  
                    It was big fun.
          
          Patrick enters, walking to the counter to order. He sees Kat 
          and smiles.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hey
          
          She gathers her things and bolts out the door.  Patrick 
          looks at Mandella, who shrugs and follows Kat.

                    So you got cozy with she who stings?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that 
                    I'm about to lose.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What'd you do to her?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I don ' t know. 
                           (beat)
                    I decided not to nail her when she was 
                    too drunk to remember it.
          
          Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then 
          turn back to Patrick.
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          You realize this puts the whole operation in peril.
          
                                 PATRICK
          
          No shit.  She won't even look at me
          
                                 CAMERON
          
          Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?
          
          Patrick's expression says that this is not a possibility. 
          Michael makes a time out sign with his hands.

          Mandella is at her locker.  Drawings of William Shakespeare 
          adorn the door.  She looks at them with a sigh, then ties 
          her silk scarf tightly around her neck, in an attempt to cut 
          off her air supply.
          
          Michael walks up.
          
                                 MICHAEL

                           loosens the scarf)

                                 MANDELLA
                    Yeah.  I guess.
          
          MICHAEL rocks.  Very hip.

                    Oh yeah.
          
          She looks at him suspiciously
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Who could refrain that had a heart to 
                    love and in that heart, courage to make 
                    ' B love known?
          
          Michael thinks for a minute.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Macbeth, right?
          
                                 MANDELLA 
                           (happily stunned)
                    Right.

                    Yeah...
          
          He leans in close to her, conspiratorially

                    You were right. She's still pissed.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Sweet love, renew thy force!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. 
                    People can hear you.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (exasperated)
                    You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice  
                    yourself on the altar of dignity and  
                    even the score.
          
                                 MICHAEL
                    Best case scenario, you're back on the 
                    payroll for awhile.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    What's the worst?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    You get the girl.
          
          Patrick  thinks for a minute
          
                                 PATRICK
                    If I go down. I'm takin' her with me
          
          INT. ENGLISH CLASS - DAY
          
          Kat and the other students sit at their desks, taking a quiz 
          Patrick's seat is conspicuously empty.
          
          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.
          
          The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    "This morning, I woke up with this 
                    feeling, I didn't know how to deal with, 
                    and so I just decided to myself--"
          
          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.
          
          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    "I'd hide it to myself.  And never talk 
                    about it.  And didn't I go and shout it 
                    when you walked into the room --"
          
          He makes quite a sarcastic show of it.
          
          IN THE CLASSROOM
          
          Mrs. Blaise touches her heart, as if the song is for her. 
          Kat slowly walks to the window, peeking below.
          
          OUTSIDE
          
          Patrick smiles at her as he finishes the verse with a big 
          finale.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    " I think I love you I "
          
          INSIDE
          
          The other students laugh, clap, cheer, etc. Kat sinks down, 
          mortified, but with a slight smile
          
          INT. DETENTION HALL - DAY
          
          Patrick and several other miscreants sit quietly, mulling 
          over their misfortune.
          
                                 MISCREANT 
                    Nice song, Verona.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Flog me.
          
          He makes the appropriate hand gesture
          
          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine
          
                                 KAT (0. S.)
                    Excuse me, Mr. Chapin?
          
          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.
          
          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.
          
                                 KAT
                    Sir, I'd like to state for the record 
                    that Mr. Verona ' s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You didn't have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.
          
          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.
          
          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.
          
          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."
          
          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.
          
          The other miscreants watch with glee.
          
                                 KAT
                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.
          
          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they're on the second floor.
          
          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    You're not gonna change my mind, Kat. 
                    Rules stick.
          
          Kat starts to panic, as Patrick has yet to make the jump for 
          the tree.
          
                                 KAT
                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something 
                    I've always wanted to show you.
          
          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.
          
          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    These.
          
          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.
          
          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.
          
          Mr. Chapin reddens and tries to be stern.
          
                                 MR. CHAPIN 
                    I'm going to let that slide, Katarina.  
                    But if I catch you doing that again, 
                    you'll be in here with the rest of these 
                    guys.
          
          He motions to the remaining detention prisoners, without 
          noticing Patrick's absence.
          
          Kat smiles at him.
          
                                 KAT
                    Thank you, Mr. Chapin.
          
          Kat bolts out the door.  Mr. Chapin goes back to his muscle 
          mag, wiping the sweat from his brow.
          
          EXT. SCHOOL CAMPUS LAWN
          
          Kat arrives at the tree. looking around breathlessly, seeing 
          no one.
          
                                 KAT
                    He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he 
                    cruised on me.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (0. S.)
                    Look up, sunshine
          
          She does.  He's still in the tree
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I guess I never told you I'm afraid of 
                    heights.
          
                                 KAT
                           (smiling)
                    C'mon.  It's not that bad
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Try lookin' at it from this angle
          
          She assesses the branch structure
          
                                 KAT
                    Put your right foot there --
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
          
                                 KAT
                    You want me to climb up and show you 
                    how to get down?
          
                                 PATRICK
                           (voice trembling)
                    Maybe.
          
          She sighs and dose so.  When she gets to his level, she 
          perches on the branch next to him.  He grins at her.
          
          Then swings himself down with the grace and ease of a 
          monkey, leaving her sitting there, realizing she's been 
          duped.
          
                                 KAT
                    You shit!
          
          She climbs down after him
          
          EXT. OUTDOOR ARCADE - DAY 
          
          Patrick and Kat walk amongst the games
          
                                 KAT
                    The Partridge Family?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I figured it had to be something 
                    ridiculous to win your respect.  And 
                    piss you off.
          
                                 KAT
                    Good call.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So how'd you get Chapin to look the 
                    other way?
          
                                 KAT
                    I dazzled him with my wit
          
          She stops and picks up a toy gun that SHOOTS water at 
          giggling hyenas and wails on it.  The barker hands her a 
          stuffed animal as her prize.  She hands it to the small KID 
          next to her and they continue walking.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (sarcastic)
                    A soft side? Who knew?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah, well, don't let it get out
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So what's your excuse?
          
                                 KAT
                    Acting the way we do.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yes
          
                                 KAT
                    I don't like to do what people expect.  
                    Then they expect it all the time and 
                    they get disappointed when you change.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So if you disappoint them from the 
                    start, you're covered?
          
                                 KAT
                    Something like that
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Then you screwed up
          
                                 KAT
                    How?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You never disappointed me.
          
          She blushes under his gaze
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You up for it?
          
                                 KAT
                    For. . . ?
          
          He motions to the SIGN for a paint-ball game. She grins 
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
          
          The two of them creep through the paint-ball course, 
          stealthy and full of the desire to best the other.
          
          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.
          
          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of 
          her face.
          
          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they're both covered in paint
          
          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Damn it!
          
          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.
          
          It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other's eyes.
          
          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he 
          goes to kiss her.

                    Look, Mom
          
          His mother hurries him away. What's started as a tackle has 
          turned into a passionate kiss
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Patrick pulls up in Kat's driveway.  Their paint wardrobe 
          has dried by now and they look like refugees from some 
          strange, yet colorful, war.
          
                                 KAT

                                 PATRICK
                    Fallacy.
          
                                 KAT
                    The duck?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Hearsay.
          
                                 KAT
                    I know the porn career's a lie.
          
          He shuts off the car and turns to her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Do you?
          
          He kisses her neck.  It tickles.  She laughs.
          
                                 KAT
                    Tell me something true.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I hate peas.
          
                                 KAT
                    No -- something real.  Something no one 
                    else knows.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (in-between kisses)
                    You're sweet.  And sexy.  And 
                    completely hot for me.
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No one else knows
          
                                 KAT
                    You're amazingly self-assured. Has 
                    anyone ever told you that?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Go to the prom with me
          
          Kat's smile disappears.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that a request or a command?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You know what I mean
          
                                 KAT
                    No.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No what?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, I won't go with you
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Why not?
          
                                 KAT
                    Because I don't want to. It's a stupid 
                    tradition.
          
          Patrick sits quietly, torn. He can't very well tell her he 
          being paid to take her.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    People won't expect you to go...
          
          Kat turns to him, getting angry.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why are you doing this?
          
                                 KAT
                    All of it -- what's in it for you?
          
          He sits silently, not looking at her, confirming her 
          suspicions.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    Create a little drama?  Start a new 
                    rumor?  What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    So I have to have a motive to be with 
                    you?
          
                                 KAT
                    You tell me.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told 
                    you that?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (quietly)
                    Answer the question, Patrick
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (angry)
                    Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me.  
                    Just the pleasure of your company.
          
          He takes out a cigarette.  She breaks it in half before she 
          SLAMS the car door and walks into the house.
          
          Patrick PEELS out of the driveway. Kat turns at the front 
          door and watches him go
          
          EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
          
          Patrick pulls up to a stop light and waits for .the green
          
          He glances over at A DRUNKEN HOMELESS GUY in the median, who 
          has decided that he doesn't need to wear pants.
          
          Patrick pulls out his wallet, takes the wad of money Joey 
          gave him and hands it to the homeless guy.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    cover that up
          
          The light turns green and Patrick pulls away
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Kat stands at the sink, scrubbing paint off of her face 
          Bianca TAPS on the open door.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Quick question -- are you going to the 
                    prom?
          
          Kat pushes the door shut with a SLAM
          
          INT. STUDY HALL - DAY
          
          Cameron and Bianca sit together at their study cubby.  She 
          fingers a strand of her hair.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Then Guillermo says, "If you go any 
                    lighter, you're gonna look like an extra 
                    on 90210."
          
                                 CAMERON
                    No...
          
          Bianca stares at him for a moment.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    do you listen to this crap?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    What crap?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm 
                    like, boring myself.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Thank God!  If I had to hear one more 
                    story about your coiffure...
          
          He mock stabs himself with a pencil as she giggles and 
          smacks his hand away.
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (continuing)
                    I figured you'd get to the good stuff 
                    eventually.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What good stuff?
          
                                 CAMERON
                    The "real you".
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like my fear of wearing pastels?
          
          He looks stricken.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I'm kidding. 
                           (beat)
                    You know how sometimes you just become 
                    this "persona"?  And you don't know how 
                    to quit?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (matter of fact)
                    No
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how 
                    to lie.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Mandella struggles with the lock on her locker.  Finally, it 
          opens.
          
          Hanging inside is a beautiful DRESS, inspired by the 16th 
          Century.  Mandella slowly unpins a NOTE from the dress.
          
          INSERT - "0 FAIR ONE.  JOIN ME AT THE PROM.  I WILL BE 
          WAITING.  LOVE, WILLIAM S."
          
          Mandella's agog.  Trevor walks by and sees her holding the 
          dress.
          
                                 TREVOR
                    You're gonna look splendiferous in 
                    that, Mandella.
          
          Mandella looks up sharply, shaken from her reverie.
          
                                 TREVOR 
                           (continuing)
                    that's cool to say.
          
          Mandella grins It is

          Sharon is at her computer, Walter at his exercise bike
          
                                 SHARON
                    Would you rather be ravished by a 
                    pirate or a British rear admiral?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Pirate -- no question.
          
          Bianca enters and walks over to Walter
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with 
                    you. It's tomorrow night --
          
                                 WALTER
                    The prom?  Kat has a date?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No, but
          
                                 WALTER
                    It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s 
                    who you want me to bend my rules for?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that 
                    is.
          
                                 WALTER
                    You're not going unless your sister 
                    goes.  End of story.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my 
                    own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a 
                    possession!
          
          Bianca storms out.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (calling out)
                    You know what happens at proms?
          
          Sharon stops her typing and looks up at Walter
          
                                 SHARON
                    They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll 
                    come home.  Let her go.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Kissing?  Is that what you think 
                    happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up 
                    to my elbows in placenta all day.
          
          INT. BIANCA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
          
          Bianca lies on her bed.  MTV blares.  A KNOCK sounds.
          
          BIANCA
          Come in.
          
          Kat enters and sits down on the bed, muting the TV.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (kindly)
                    Listen, I know you hate having to sit 
                    home because I'm not Susie High School.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Like you care.
          
                                 KAT
                    I do care. But I'm a firm believer in 
                    doing something for your own reasons, 
                    not someone else ' s .
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only 
                    sophomore that got asked to the prom and 
                    I can't go, because you won ' t.
          
          Kat clears her throat
          
                                 KAT
                    Joey never told you we went out, did 
                    he?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    What?
          
                                 KAT
                    In 9th.  For a month

                           (confused)
                    Why?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (self-mocking)
                    He was, like, a total babe
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But you hate Joey
          
                                 KAT
                    Now I do.  Back then, was a different 
                    story.

                    As in...
          
          Kat takes a deep breath.
          
                                 KAT
                    He said everyone was doing it.  So I 
                    did it.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You did what?
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing on)
                    Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I 
                    didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready.  
                    He got pissed.  Then he broke up with 
                    me.
          
          Bianca stares at her, dumbfounded
          
                                 BIANCA
                    But
          
                                 KAT
                    After that, I swore I'd never do 
                    anything just because "everyone else" 
                    was doing it.  And I haven't since. 
                    Except for Bogey's party, and my 
                    stunning gastro-intestinal display --
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (stunned)
                    Why didn't you tell me?
          
                                 KAT
                    I wanted to let you make up your own 
                    mind about him.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No. you didn't!  If you really thought 
                    I could make my own decisions, you 
                    would've let me go out with him instead 
                    of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
          
          Kat stands up slowly
          
                                 KAT
                    That's not
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I'm not stupid enough to repeat your 
                    mistakes.
          
                                 KAT
                    I guess I thought I was protecting you.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    God, you're just like him! Just keep me 
                    locked away in the dark, so I can't 
                    experience anything for myself
          
                                 KAT
                    Not all experiences are good, Bianca. 
                    You can't always trust the people you 
                    want to.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I guess I'll never know, will I?
          
          She rises and holds the door open for Kat, then slams it 
          behind her.
          
          EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
          
          A sprinkler cruises the lawn.
          
          INT. KAT'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Kat lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.  She rolls over and 
          picks up the phone.
          
          BIANCA'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca, still in her pajamas, eats a bowl of cereal while 
          watching "I Love Lucy" reruns.
          
          A KNOCK sounds
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Come in.
          
          Kat opens the door and peers in with a grin
          
                                 KAT
                    Feel like shopping?
          
          Bianca looks up, hopefully.
          
          LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Walter and Sharon are in front of the television.  Walter 
          has the TV Guide in hand, glasses on.
          
                                 WALTER
                    What do you wanna watch?  We've got 
                    crap, crap, crap or crap
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Dr. Ruth?
          
          Bianca walks into the living room.  She's wearing a prom 
          dress.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Hi, Mommy.
                           (looking away)
                                 WALTER
          
          Walter scurries takes off his glasses and looks from Bianca 
          to Sharon.
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Honey, you look beautiful!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You like?  My date should be here in 
                    five.
          
                                 WALTER
                    I'm missing something.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a 
                    captain of oppression like some men we 
                    know.
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS.  Bianca runs to open it.  There stands 
          CAMERON.  He takes in Bianca's outfit.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Wow
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let's go.
          
          Walter rises.  Sharon pulls him back down on the couch
          
                                 SHARON 
                           (to Bianca)
                    Have a great time, honey!
          
                                 WALTER
                    But -- who -- what --?
          
          The door SLAMS.  As Sharon looks at Walter with a grin, a 
          blur rushes down the stairs and out the door.  The blur has 
          Kat ' s voice.
          
                                 KAT
                    Hey, guys. I'm going to the prom. See 
                    you in a few.
          
          The door SLAMS again.  Walter and Sharon 'are alone
          
                                 WALTER
                    What just happened?
          
                                 SHARON
                    Your daughters went to the prom.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Did I have anything to say about it?
          
                                 SHARON 
                    Absolutely not.
          
                                 WALTER
                    That ' s what I thought
          
          The DOORBELL RINGS again. Walter opens it to find Joey on 
          the porch, wearing a tux.
          
                                 JOEY 
                    I'm here to pick up Bianca.
          
                                 WALTER
                    late
          
          He SLAMS the door shut
          
          EXT  HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
          
          Kat pulls up in her car, emerging resplendent in an ice 
          gown.
          
          Patrick sits on the steps, waiting.  In a tux.
          
                                 KAT
                    How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted.  
                    Where'd you get the dress?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just something I had.  You know
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (smiling)
                    Oh huh
          
                                 KAT
                    Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I 
                    questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
          
          Patrick winces slightly, but covers it with a smile
          
                                 PATRICK
                    No prob.
          
          He remains seated.  Kat fidgets nervously.
          
                                 KAT
                    are you ready?
          
          He rises and stares at her, taking in her image 
          appreciatively.  She blushes and turns away.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    C'mon.  Let's get this over with.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          A hotel ballroom transformed into a fantasy world.  Patrick 
          and Kat enter, Kat attempting to deny the romance of it.
          
                                 KAT
                    Quite the ostentatious display
          
          A cowboy two-steps by them, dragging some poor girl around
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Look, Clem even wore his good boots
          
          Kat steps forward, looking around and spots Cameron and 
          Bianca dancing cheek to cheek.  She smiles.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Mandella enters nervously, in the long Elizabethan gown, 
          hair piled on top of her head.  She spots Kat and hurries 
          over.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    Have you seen him?
          
                                 KAT
                    Who?
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    William - he asked me to meet him here.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' 
                    progressed to full-on hallucinations.
          
          Patrick looks toward the door and taps Kat.  She turns and 
          points Mandella the same way.
          
          Michael - in full Shakespearean dress with a new goatee on 
          his chin - bows in their direction. Mandella's grin couldn't 
          be bigger.
          
          Michael swashbuckles over to them, taking Mandella's hand 
          and leading her onto the dance floor.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                    Mi' lady.
          
                           (to Patrick)
                    Good sir.
          
          Patrick rolls his eyes.
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT - LATER
          
          Kat and Patrick dance to a slow SONG.  Whatever he's 
          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.
          
          Cam and Bianca dance nearby, glowing with happiness. She 
          whispers something in his ear and heads for the ladies' room
          
          INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Bianca walks in, positively radiant. Chastity emerges from a 
          stall.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (surprised)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Chastity checks her hair in the mirror,  aloof.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    You think you ' re the only sophomore 
                    at the prom?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I did.
          
          Chastity maintains her snooty tone.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    And just so you know, my date isn't 
                    planning on spending most of the night 
                    in his backseat.
          
          BIANCA What're you talking about?
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                    Joey Dorsey is only after one thing - - 
                    your cherry. He practically made a 
                    public announcement.
          
          Appalled, Bianca storms out. Chastity  tries to backpedal.
          
                                 CHASTITY 
                           (continuing)
                    I wanted to tell you
          
          INT.  PROM - NIGHT
          
          Joey, drunk, disorderly and pissed off, walks in with a few 
          stray jocks - also dateless.  He zeroes in on Cameron, now 
          consoling a pissed-off Bianca.
          
          Patrick and Kat continue to slow dance, oblivious to the 
          evil about to erupt.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    My grandmother's .
          
                                 KAT
                    What?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    That's where I was last year.  She'd 
                    never lived alone -- my grandfather died 
                    -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, 
                    I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've 
                    never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent 
                    a year sitting next to my grandma on the 
                    couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of 
                    story.
          
          He takes a breath and looks away, not meeting her eyes. Kat 
          stares at him for a moment and laughs a delighted laugh
          
                                 KAT
                    That ' s completely adorable!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It gets worse -- you still have your 
                    freshman yearbook?
          
          He's interrupted by Joey's hand on his shoulder.
          
                                 JOEY
                    What's Bianca doing here with that 
                    cheese dick?  I didn't pay you to let 
                    some little punk ass snake me.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael spots the altercation and dances Mandella over to 
          Cameron and Bianca.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (to Cameron)
                    Feces hitting fan.  C'mon
          
          Michael takes Cameron aside, leaving Mandella and Bianca 
          staring after them.
          
          ACROSS THE ROOM
          
          Michael and Cameron approach Joey as he continues to taunt 
          Patrick who keeps quiet, realizing the weight of this 
          situation.
          
                                 MICHAEL 
                           (continuing)
                    Joey, pal, compadre.  Let's take it 
                    easy.
          
          Joey turns toward Michael and Cameron.
          
          JOEY You two are in big trouble
          
          Cameron faces Joey.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Admit it.  You lost.  Be a man.
          
          Joey PUNCHES Cameron in the face, taking him by surprise 
          Cameron holds his nose as it bleeds onto his tux
          
          The various cliques descend angrily and Joey is soon 
          surrounded by seething Cowboys, Coffee Kids and White 
          Rastas.
          
                                 DEREK 
                    Very uncool, my brother
          
                                 JOEY
                    I'm not your brother, white boy.
          
          The other Rastas GASP, as if stung by the realization that 
          they're white.
          
          Joey turns back to Patrick and Kat.
          
                                 JOEY 
                           (continuing)
                    Just so you know -- she'll only spread 
                    her legs once.
          
          Kat looks from Joey to Patrick, not sure what she's hearing. 
          Joey pushes through the crowd but a HAND drags him back. 
          It's Bianca.  And she BELTS the hell out of him
          
                                 BIANCA
                    That's for making my date bleed
          
          She BELTS him again
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    That's for my sister.
          
          And AGAIN
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    And that's for me.
          
          Cliques now descend on Joey, punching him wildly.
          
                                 COWBOY
                    And that's for the fourth grade, 
                    asshole.
          
          HOTEL - NIGHT 
          
          KAT runs down the stairs, Patrick chasing her
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Wait I...
          
                                 KAT
                    You were paid to take me out!  By -- 
                    the one person I truly hate.  I knew it 
                    was a set-up!
          
                                 PATRICK
                    It wasn't like that.
          
                                 KAT
                    Really?  What was it like?  A down 
                    payment now, then a bonus for sleeping 
                    with me?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I didn't care about the money.
          
          He catches up to her now
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    I cared about --
          
          She turns to face him with a countenance more in sorrow than 
          in anger.
          
                                 KAT
                    You are so not what I thought you were.
          
          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.
          
          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's 
          never looked more guilty.
          
          INT. STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY
          
          Kat is sprawled on the couch in sweats, wrapped in a 
          blanket, watching "Sixteen Candles".  When Molly Ringwald 
          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial
          
          The phone sits next to her.  Not ringing.  Bianca breezes 
          in, bearing a cup of tea.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Are you sure you don't want to come 
                    with us?  It'll be fun.
          
          Kat takes the tea and gives a weak smile.
          
                                 KAT
                    I ' m sure .
          
          Bianca sits down next to her
          
                                 BIANCA
                    You looked beautiful last night, you 
                    know.
          
                                 KAT
                    So did you
          
          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his 
          head inside.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    She okay?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I hope so.
          
          The door shuts behind her as Walter enters.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Was that your sister?
          
                                 KAT
                    Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big 
                    ones.  Full of sperm.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Funny.
          
          Walter sits down on the arm of the chair and watches the 
          infomercial with Kat.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    I don't understand the allure of 
                    dehydrated food.  Is this something I 
                    should be hip to?
          
                                 KAT
                    No, Daddy.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (dreading the 
                           answer)
                    So tell me about this dance. Was it 
                    fun?
          
                                 KAT
                    Parts of it.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Which parts?
          
                                 KAT
                    The part where Bianca beat the hell out 
                    of some guy.
          
                                 WALTER
                    Bianca did what?
          
                                 KAT
                    What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed 
                    off on her?
          
                                 WALTER
                    No -- impressed.
          
          Kat looks up in surprise.
          
                                 WALTER
                           (continuing)
                    You know, fathers don't like to admit 
                    that their daughters are capable of 
                    running their own lives.  It means we've 
                    become spectators.  Bianca still lets me 
                    play a few innings.  You've had me on 
                    the bleachers for years.  When you go to 
                    Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to 
                    watch the game.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (hopeful)
                    When I go?
          
                                 WALTER
                    Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've 
                    changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a 
                    check.
          
          Kat reaches over and gives him a hug
          
          INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Kat stands grabs a box of cornflakes 
          from the food line.
          
                                 CAMERON (0. S.)
                    Katarina?
          
          She turns and looks at him
          
                                 CAMERON
                    I'd like to express my apologies.
          
                                 KAT
                    For what?
          
                                 CAMERON
                           (looking down)
                    I didn't mean for you to get -- When 
                    Bianca asked me to find you a boyfriend, 
                    I had no idea it would turn out so -- 
                    ugly. I would never have  done anything 
                    to compromise your - - -
          
          He trails off when he realizes she's thrown her food tray 
          against the wall and marched off -- the old "kill, kill" 
          look back in her eyes.
          
          INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
          
          Kat stomps up the hallway, full of menace
          
          CLASSROOM - DAY
          
          Bianca's English teacher perches on the edge of a desk, open 
          book in hand.
          
                                 TEACHER
                    Who can tell me at what point Lucentio 
                    admits his deception?
          
          The door of the classroom FLIES open and an angry Kat stalks 
          in, yanking Bianca from her chair and dragging her toward 
          the hallway.
          
                                 KAT

          HALLWAY - DAY
          
          Bianca tries to pull away as Kat drags her by the hair 
          between two rows of lockers.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Let go!
          
                                 KAT
                    You set me up.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    I just wanted --
          
                                 KAT
                    What? To completely damage me?  To send 
                    me to therapy forever? What?
          
                                 BIANCA
                    No! I just wanted
          
          Miss Perky walks up
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    Ladies?  Shall we take a trip to my 
                    office?
          
          INT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Miss Perky stares at both sisters as they sit before her, 
          then focuses on Bianca.
          
                                 MISS PERKY
                    So you're the real bitch
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Yes!  Okay?  Yes -- I'm the real bitch.  
                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I'm sorry.
          
          She turns to Kat.
          
                                 BIANCA
                           (continuing)
                    I swear -- I didn't know about the 
                    money.  I didn't even know Joey was 
                    involved.  I would never intentionally 
                    hurt you, Kat.
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                           (to Kat)
                    Do you care to respond?
          
                                 KAT
                    Am I supposed to feel better? Like, 
                    right now?  Or do I have some time to 
                    think about it?
          
                                 MISS PERKY 
                    Just smack her now.
          
          Bianca rises, taking Kat by the arm.
          
                                 BIANCA

                                 BIANCA
                    Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or 
                    is it just me?
          
                                 KAT
                    It's just you.
          
          ENGLISH CLASS - DAY 
          
          Mrs. Blaise faces the class
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE
                    All right.  I'm assuming everyone found 
                    time to compose, their poems. Except for 
                    Mr. Dorsey, who's still in ICU.
          
          Nerds in the back high-five each other.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Would anyone care to read theirs aloud?
          
          No one moves.  Then Kat slowly stands up.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'11 go
          
          Patrick looks up.
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                    Oh, Lord.
          
          She downs a couple Prozac
          
                                 MRS. BLAISE 
                           (continuing)
                    Please proceed.
          
          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.
          
                                 KAT
                    I hate the way you talk to me/ and the 
                    way you cut your hair/ I hate the way 
                    you drive my car/ I hate it when you 
                    stare.
          
          She pauses, then continues
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate your big dumb combat boots/ and 
                    the way you read my mind/ I hate you so 
                    much it makes me sick/ it even makes me 
                    rhyme.
          
          She takes a deep breath, and looks quickly at Patrick, who 
          stares at the floor.
          
                                 KAT 
                           (continuing)
                    I hate the way you're always right/ I 
                    hate it when you lie/ I hate it when you 
                    make me laugh/ even worse when you make 
                    me cry/ I hate it that you're not 
                    around/ and the fact that you didn't 
                    call/ But mostly I hate the way I don ' 
                    t hate you/ not even close, not even a 
                    little bit, not even any at all.
          
          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.
          
          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.
          
          EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.
          
          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.
          
          Patrick stands there, smiling.
          
                                 KAT
                    A Fender Strat. You bought this?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I thought you could use it. When you 
                    start your band.
          
          She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    Besides, I had some extra cash. Some 
                    asshole paid me to take out a really 
                    great girl.
          
                                 KAT
                    Is that right?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for 
                    her.
          
          Blushes and looks down.
          
                                 PATRICK 
                           (continuing)
                    You know -- it's not every day you find 
                    a girl who'll flash her tits to get you 
                    out of detention.
          
          Looks up. surprised and embarrassed that he found out
          
          He takes her upturned face as a sign to kiss her and he does 
          She lets him this time.
          
          Then breaks it off
          
                                 KAT
                    You can't just buy me a guitar every 
                    time you screw up, you know.
          
          He grimaces.
          
                                 PATRICK
                    I know
          
          He quiets her with another kiss Which she breaks off again.
          
                                 KAT
                    And don't just think you can
          
          He kisses her again, not letting her end it this time.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE - SUNSET
          
          We hear the sounds of MUSIC and LAUGHTER.
          
          STRATFORD HOUSE/BACKYARD - SUNSET
          
          Patrick is at the barbecue grill, flipping burgers.  Kat 
          watches.
          
                                 KAT
                    Why is my veggie burger the only burnt 
                    object on this grill?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Because I like to torture you.
          
                                 KAT
                    Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman 
                    yearbook?
          
                                 PATRICK
                    Don ' t you even dare. . .
          
          ON BIANCA AND CAMERON As they argue on the patio.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    They do to!
          
                                 BIANCA
                    They do not!
          
          Rises to get the yearbook.
          
                                 CAMERON
                    Can someone please tell her that 
                    sunflower seeds come from sunflowers?
          
          ON MICHAEL AND MANDELLA
          
          Severely making-out in a lawn chair.  She comes up for a 
          breath.
          
                                 MANDELLA
                    I can't remember a word of Shakespeare 
                    right now. Isn't that weird?
          
          Michael pulls her back down for another round ON KAT AND 
          PATRICK
          
          She tries to keep him from grabbing the yearbook that Bianca 
          now hands her.
          
                                 KAT
                    You're freaked over this, aren't you?
          
          Bianca hands her the yearbook
          
                                 BIANCA
                    He's more than freaked.  He's froke
          
          Flips to a page.
          
                                 KAT
                    I'd like to call your attention to 
                    Patrick Verona's stunning bad-ass look 
                    of 1995 ---
          
          INSERT - A horrifically nerdy freshman year picture Glasses, 
          bad hair, headgear -- the works.
          
          She holds up the picture for all to view. Patrick cringes 
          and throws a handful of pretzels at her.
          
                                 BIANCA
                    Patrick -- is that- a.

                    Ask my attorney.
          
          Kat and Bianca huddle over the picture, giggling --  as we 
          CRANE UP and hear a GIRLY PUNK version of The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".

          The following is very loosely based on some shit that actually
          happened...
                         OVER BLACK
                         
          We hear the roar of a V8 engine, piped out through some
          throaty, fucked up muffler, as
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          An '89 Mustang bursts like a shot over a rise in the highway.
          It's got a rusted two-tone paint job, Maryland plates, and
          bald tires that scream as it peels off an exit and into the
                         
          EXT. SUBURBS - DAY
                         
          The car fast approaches a stop sign, dangerously blows through
          the intersection.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          We don't see the DRIVER, only the redlining RPMs, Vans slip-
          ons working the pedals, wristwatch being checked. The wheel
          cranks right as the car turns onto a -
                         
          One way street. A minivan flies right at us. The Mustang
          hops up onto the curb to avoid it, clips a trash can and -
                         
          Garbage explodes like confetti. The wipers engage, brushing
          the trash aside. The car whips another turn and
                         
          EXT. SUBURBS - DAY
                         
          The Mustang fishtails around a corner and skids away.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         TIRES SCREECH
                         
          Brake pads smoke. The Mustang stops outside
                         
          EXT. HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Driver jumps out of the car. As he rushes to the front
          door, we see the urgent package he is delivering.
                         
          TWO LARGE PIZZAS
                         
          Before he can ring the bell, the door opens and two smug 15-
          YEAR-OLDS stare out.
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           That's 34 minutes. You're 4 minutes
           late. Pizza's free.
                         
          REVEAL our guy staring back at the kids. This is WILL (25),
          probably good looking in another life.
           2.
                         
          Right now, he is tired and unamused, wearing a red "Giorgio's
          Trattoria" hat and a sweaty matching t-shirt.
                         
                          WILL
           Gimme a break. You guys live two
           towns away. It's pretty much fucking
           impossible to get here in 30 minutes.
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           Exactly. That's why we ordered from
           your shitty "trattoria."
                         
                          WILL
           This is gonna come out of my paycheck.
           You sure you don't want to take the
           moral high ground?
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           We'd rather take the pizzas.
                         
          Will takes a calming breath. Hands over the pizzas.
                         
                          WILL
           Ok. You guys are pretty smart. You
           figured out a way to beat the system.
                          (PEEKS INSIDE)
           Got the house to yourselves?
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           That's right.
                         
                          WILL
           Not bad. Any jailbait in there?
           Little pizza and a rainbow party?
                         
          The kids shakes their heads.
                         
                          WILL
           Seriously? Well, two hustlers like
           yourselves gotta have the place
           stocked with beer and whippits and
           shit, right? Just call the girls up
           and let them know the party's on.
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           Man, we don't have any of that stuff.
                         
          Will makes a show of mulling this over.
                         
                          WILL
           I really shouldn't do this...but you
           seem like a couple of good dudes.
           I'll tell you what, you give me the
           money that your mom left you for the
           pizzas, and I'll grab you some beers.
                          (MORE)
           3.
                         
                          WILL (CONT'D)
                          (BEAT)
           But I get to keep the change as a
           tip. Deal?
                         
          The kids look at each other. One hesitantly pulls out some
          cash. Will snatches it and heads off.
                         
                          WILL
           I'll see you in like 20 minutes.
                         
          The kids look uncertain. As if sensing this, Will stops
          before getting into his ride.
                         
                          WILL
           You boys like Budweiser, right?
                         
                          15-YEAR-OLD
           Uh, yeah, totally.
                         
                          OTHER 15-YEAR-OLD
           Love that shit!
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          The sun sets. Will cruises back into his own middle-class
          town in suburban Maryland.
                         
          A six pack of Budweiser rests in the passenger seat.
                         
          Will stops at a light. Checks out a PRETTY YOUNG THING in
          the Jeep beside him. She catches him looking, rolls her
          eyes. The light turns and the Jeep skids away.
                         
          Will self consciously removes his "Giorgio's" cap.
                         
          INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT
                         
          Will enters and nods at CHRISTOPHER (40s), the manager. His
          balding head is nearly translucent from absorbing a day's
          worth of pizza grease.
                         
                          WILL
           Yo, Chris. Let me cash the fuck out.
                         
          Will hands over some cash to Christopher.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           You have a pretty good shift?
                         
                          WILL
           For sure. I mean, the part where I
           had to drop off all those pizzas
           kinda sucked, but the rest was cool.
           4.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           Oh, yeah? 'Cause, I got some kids
           calling in saying you ripped them off.
           Promised to buy them beer or something.
                         
                          WILL
           I actually did buy the beer, but it
           would have been illegal to give it
           to them, right? So I'm gonna do the
           responsible thing and drink it myself.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           That's real funny. But I'm trying
           to run a business here.
                         
                          WILL
           What kind of business promises to
           deliver anywhere in 30 minutes?
           It's ridiculous.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I don't wanna hear another one of
           your bullshit excuses. You're fired.
                         
                          WILL
           Come on. If I didn't need this job,
           I wouldn't be doing this shitty job.
                         
          Chris is unmoving.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck! Whatever!
                         
          Will storms off. As he gets to the door -
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           You know, you were an okay driver
           half the time. And you're not a Puerto
           Rican. Which means something to me.
                         
                          WILL
           That's poignant.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I guess I could rehire you, on a
           provisional basis. Of course, this
           would be at the slightly reduced
           "new company rate."
                         
                          WILL
           Are you fucking serious?
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           I don't know. Is there anyone else
           left in town for you to work for?
           5.
                         
          Will shakes his head. Swallows what's left of his pride.
                          WILL
           When do I start?
          EXT. SMALL APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
          Will sits on the darkened front stoop. He tosses an empty
          can into the bushes and gets to work on his fourth beer.
          He looks over at a parked Hyundai Elantra. A YOUNG MAN sits
          in the passenger seat with a pensive look on his face. He
          makes a sudden, surprised gasp. The homely YOUNG WOMAN who
          was just blowing him sits up from his lap and rearranges
          herself in the driver seat. She leans over for a goodbye
          kiss. The Young Man obliges with much fanfare.
          The Young Man gets out and the car pulls away. This is CHET
          (25), a clean cut guy dressed in the Gap Premium Collection.
          He heads toward the building, high off his BJ, humming
          Outkast's "Ms. Jackson." He stops when he notices Will in
          the shadows.
                          CHET
           What the hell? Have you just been
           sitting there?
                          WILL
           Yep. Caught the whole show. Really
           classy move at the end. You know,
           the kiss. Putting your tongue in
           her mouth right after you fucked it.
                          CHET
           Hey, a nice girl decides to pleasure
           me on a weeknight, in her car no
           less...I'm not gonna make her feel
           like an untouchable. I'm gonna make
           her feel like a lady.
                          WILL
           What manners. May I offer you some
           alcohol, sir. To wash the taste of
           yourself out of your mouth.
          Will offers his beer. Chet takes a slug, gurgles for effect.
                         
                          CHET
           By the way, she said she had a friend.
           Maybe we can go on our first double
           date since you tried to talk Jackie
           Fortunato and her cousin into having
           a four-way with us.
                         
                          WILL
           I misread their body language. It
           happens.
           6.
                         
          Will picks up some rented movies sitting beside him.
                         
                          WILL
           Come on. Let's go inside, drink
           your beer and watch shit get crazy.
                          (FANS MOVIES)
           Old favorites. You choose. Lethal
           Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2...was gonna
           get the third Lethal Weapon, but
           decided on a porn. So it's really
           between the first two.
                         
                          CHET
           I choose sleep. I gotta teach a
           class at eight.
                         
                          WILL
           You're a sub. Just call in sick.
           Like the real teacher did.
                         
                          CHET
           Come on, man, you know I got promoted
           to full-time last month. You bought
           me a laser pointer.
                         
          Will heaves a sigh.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, I know. I guess I'm just having
           a hard time accepting you as "the
           man." You know, flunking kids, giving
           out spite detentions to girls you
           wanna fuck, laser pointing at shit.
                         
                          CHET
           I also get healthcare and my summers
           off. It's not perfect, but it's a
           career.
                         
          Will grudgingly stands up.
                         
                          WILL
           I guess that's just the difference
           between you and me.
                         
          He holds up the Lethal Weapon DVDs.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm like Riggs. Cruising the streets.
           No rules, no attachments. Every
           other day some asshole is trying to
           take my badge. You're fucking
           Murtaugh. Always worried about your
           pension. Well, guess what, it gets
           old after the first movie.
           7.
                         
                          CHET
           I just got head. I'm totally Riggs.
          Will shakes his head, turns and walks off.
          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - DAY
          Will wakes up, legs dangling over the edge of a tiny couch.
          His TV is still on, displaying the menu screen from a porn.
          Will looks down at his coffee table. Clears some magazines
          to reveal a file folder. Flips the cover -
          It's full of college applications, drafts of admissions essays,
          a junior college transcript. Will thumbs through one of the
          glossy applications. The kids look young. Very young.
          Will glances over at a picture on his wall: he and Chet at
          high school graduation, looking just as young. They have
          their arms around a pretty girl squeezed between them. Will
          and the girl look very high and very happy.
          Will shuts the folder, slides it back under the coffee table
          debris. He looks over at a clock: it is already 2:00 PM.
                          WILL
           Fuck.
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY
          Will jumps in and starts the engine. As he tucks his
          "Giorgio's" cap onto his head, he catches his reflection in
          the rear-view mirror.
                         
                          WILL
           You asshole. You titanic asshole.
           Come on down and get your prize.
                         
          He makes his fingers into a gun, puts it to his head...pulls
          the trigger and
                         
          BOOM!
                         
                         WE'RE IN
                         
          EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY
                         
          A watermelon explodes in a shower of red, juicy bits. Loud,
          dumb laughter echoes.
                         
          Standing 20 yards away is DWAYNE (32), an intense, meaty guy
          in a sleeveless Baltimore Ravens t-shirt. On his left bicep
          is a tattoo of the Tasmanian Devil flipping the bird.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fruit motherfuckin' salad!
           8.
                         
          Crouched beside him is JAY (27), tall and awkward, in a wool
          surplus cap. He carefully rigs homemade explosives to another
          watermelon, then looks up at Dwayne. His eyes are magnified
          into saucers by his thick glasses. There's a peculiar
          eagerness to please in them.
                         
                          JAY
           This one's gonna blow even bigger.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Boy, if you weren't such a skinny
           little bitch you coulda been in the
           military or something.
                         
                          JAY
           Whatever. I don't need the military.
           I taught myself how to do this shit.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I hear that. I taught myself how to
           eat pussy. And cut my own hair.
                         
          Jay jogs the watermelon a safe distance away. He returns
          and pulls out a detonator. Dwayne snatches it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This one's all me.
           (makes "radio" sounds)
           Mr. President, we have enemies at
           the gate. Give me the order.
           (more "radio" sounds)
           Fuck that, sir. I don't negotiate
           with terrorists!
                         
          Dwayne presses a button and
                         
          BOOM!
                         
          The explosion is so powerful that it sprinkles our guys'
          smiling faces with fruit juice.
                         
          INT. KITCHEN, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Large and early-90s chic. Dwayne and Jay have the fridge
          open, fixing themselves a cold cut plate. Dwayne is debating
          the amount of meat on the plate...adds some more.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Wanna make sure I get enough calories.
                         
                          JAY
           I thought you wanted to get diesel
           for the summer. Bang that towel
           girl at the community pool.
           9.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's obvious you don't know shit-all
           about physical fitness. You gotta
           bulk up first, then you slim down.
           I'm clearly in the bulk up phase. I
           told you to watch Pumping Iron like
           a month ago. If you'd listened to
           me, maybe you'd know what the fuck
           I'm talking about.
                          (BEAT)

          INT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The shades are drawn. We hear a girl scream bloody murder!
                         
          The guys are watching FRIDAY THE 13TH PART 3...in 3D. They
          both wear cheap cardboard glasses.
                         
          Jay jumps back as Jason wields a 3D ax.
                         
                          JAY
           Shit, man! It's so real!
                         
          Dwayne reaches out, "touching" the 3D images. He stands and
          starts humping the air.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Check it out. I ain't afraid of
           Jason. I'm fucking him.
                          (THRUSTING HARDER)
           You like that, Jason!? In the mask!
                         
          Jay cracks up. The lights flick on.
                         
           GRIZZLED VOICE (O.S.)
           Who are you two fags fucking?
                         
          Standing by the switch is Dwayne's dad, JERRY (70s). Most
          people just call him "THE MAJOR." The faded USMC tattoo on
          his thick forearm explains why.
                         
                          JAY
           Afternoon, Major.
                         
          Dwayne flops back onto the couch.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, we're watching a flick. We got
           45 minutes and a potential 3D sex
           scene left. You're sorta coming in
           at the worst possible moment.
           10.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I bought that TV set so I could watch
           my programs, not so you and your
           friend could louse up my couch.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You gotta learn how to share the
           common space.
                         
                          MAJOR
           The only thing common in this house
           is you. You remind me of your damn
           mother. Fat, dumb, and in my way.
                         
          The Major grabs Dwayne and pulls him up off the couch. He
          gets right in his face...scary, intense. Dwayne turns to Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Let's get outta here. This movie
           sucks anyway.
                         
          Jay gets up and files out the door. Dwayne goes to take the
          cold cut plate. The Major grabs his arm.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I paid for the damn cold cuts, too.
           Maybe if you had a job, or a fucking
           prospect, or a clue how to find any
           of the above, I'd let you eat 'em.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (QUIETLY)
           You know, you can be a real
           sonofabitch, dad.
                         
                          MAJOR
           That's what it takes, boy. In the
           Corps, men like you wore dresses to
           keep us entertained.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's pretty fucking disturbing!
                         
          Dwayne storms off.
                         
          EXT. NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay head out, passing a brand new pickup truck in
          the driveway. Dwayne spits on it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck The Major!
                         
          The guys get in a shitty Ford Aerostar minivan and peel out.
           11.
                         
          INT. DIVE STRIP CLUB - DAY
                         
          R. Kelly's "Ignition (Remix)" pumps.
                         
          Large, fake breasts, sparkling with cheap body glitter and
          pierced at the nipples, shake before us. Their owner, JUICY
          (27), a petite Latina, phones in a lap dance as Dwayne pours
          his heart out to her.
                         
          Somewhere in the background, Jay hangs at the bar, all alone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           - and he thinks he knows me. He
           don't know shit. I got ideas he
           could never dream of. I got plans
           bigger than his fucking house.
                          (BEAT)
           He didn't even raise me. My mother
           did. That was a good woman.
                         
                          JUICY
           Oh yeah? What happened to her?
                         
          Dwayne shifts, uncomfortably, at the sore subject.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           She passed on.
                         
                          JUICY
           I hope you're not one of those guys
           that comes here looking to get
           mothered.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wouldn't mind nursing on them
           titties, mamacita.
                         
                          JUICY
           Sure. Whatever you say. Maybe just
           keep quiet for a while, forget about
           your old man and let me do my thing.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wish I could forget about that
           asshole for good. I'm just waiting
           around for him to drop dead. Don't
           wanna mess with my inheritance.
                         
          This piques Juicy's interest.
                         
                          JUICY
           What kinda inheritance?
           12.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           When my dad got outta the service, he
           started buying lotto tickets. He'd
           play his dog tag numbers. In '91,
           the fucker won five million bucks.
          INSERT PHOTO: The Major holding a giant cardboard check.
                          DWAYNE
           He had some health problems a few
           years back, and since then he's been
           burning through the money like an
           NBA draft pick. Probably only got a
           million or two left. But it's mine
           as soon as he kicks.
          Behind inch-long fake eyelashes, Juicy's shrewd eyes narrow,
          mind working. She straddles Dwayne, tightly.
                          JUICY
           You know, with a million bucks, you
           could have anything. Be like a king.
           (almost a moan)
           King Dwayne.
                          DWAYNE
           That's right. And maybe I'll make
           you my queen. Let you polish my
           royal scepter.
                          JUICY
           Practice makes perfect.
          Juicy pantomimes a long, slow chicken head. Dwayne is blissed
          out. She smiles at him, sticky sweet.
                          JUICY
           Let me ask you a question...do you
           really hate your daddy?
                          DWAYNE
           Hate him like the Steelers.
                          JUICY
           Then maybe I can help you get that
           money now. Before he spends another
           penny.
                         
          Dwayne looks confused. Juicy puts his hands on her breasts,
          emboldening him.
                         
                          JUICY
           I know a guy in Baltimore. He could
           help you out. Probably do it for...
           (sizing him up)
           ...100Gs.
           13.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Do what?
                         
          Juicy leans in, whispers softly in Dwayne's ear -
                         
                          JUICY
           Kill your mean old dad.
                         
          On Dwayne's face as this new possibility pinballs around his
          mind, setting off a flood of different emotions.
                         
                          JUICY
           So, what do you think...you ready
           for your crown?
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will has one pizza left in the back of his car. He pulls
          over outside an office building.
                         
          INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT
                         
          Rows of cubicles. Speckled with late night STRAGGLERS, bleary
          eyes, too busy generating detailed lists of places they'd
          rather be to notice the pizza boy walking along. Will stops
          before one such work station, looks on for a beat.
                         
                          WILL
           Rio?
                         
          KATE (25) turns from the glow of her computer screen. She
          has short, messy hair and a sarcastic smile. This is the
          girl from the picture in Will's apartment.
                         
                          KATE
           That's the plan. Five days, six
           nights. Culture. Beaches.
           Acceptable probability of kidnapping.
           I leave in the morning.
                         
          Kate looks back at her computer, logged onto an Expedia
          checkout page for a Rio vacation. She moves the mouse pointer
          from the "proceed" key...closes the window.
                         
                          KATE
           This morning I loaded up an African
           Safari and a cruise to Alaska.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, the places you'll go.
                         
                          KATE
           Fuck Expedia. Travel Advisor. Making
           it seem so easy.
           14.
                         
                          WILL
           It is. Just do it. Get away for a
           while.
                         
                          KATE
           Even if I could afford that...they
           fired two other paralegals last week.
           Now's not the time to be putting in
           for vacation days.
                         
                          WILL
           Ok. Done. I've got my dose of the
           actual working world. Can we eat?
                         
          Will lays a pizza down on her desk.
                         
                          KATE
           How do you keep sneaking up here
           past the security guard?
                         
                          WILL
           He's there like half the time. The
           other half I smile at him. I'm
           relatively certain he's a homosexual.
                         
                          KATE
           Interesting theory...
                         
          Kate opens the pizza box, grabs a slice.
                         
                          KATE
           Maybe I should set him up with Tom
           Small. He came out to me today on
           Facebook.
                         
                          WILL
           That kid beat the hell out of me and
           Chet in grammar school. Wow.
                         
                          KATE
           Tell me about it. He fingered me at
           junior prom while they were playing
           "No Scrubs."
                         
                          WILL
                          (WINCES)
           Really? What a fucking scrub.
                         
          Will grabs a slice. They eat quietly for a beat.
                         
                          KATE
           So, I've got some news...
           15.
                         
                          WILL
           I thought the Tom Small stuff was
           enough of a headline, but go ahead.
                         
                          KATE
           I'm getting back together with Mark.
                         
          Will's delicious pizza suddenly tastes like shit. He does
          his best to swallow it down.
                         
                          WILL
           But you...you broke up with
           him...ended the relationship.
           Finality was had.
                         
                          KATE
           Yeah, but we were talking and -
                         
                          WILL
           Forget it. I don't want to know.
                         
                          KATE
           You sound like Chet.
                         
                          WILL
           Woah, don't compare me to your
           brother.
                         
                          KATE
           Well, neither one of you seems to
           care that I don't have a life. Mark's
           not perfect...but a relationship is
           better than working late every Friday
           because I have nowhere else to be.
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. I get it. Here we are. Friday
           night. Nowhere to be.
                         
          Kate shoves Will, good-naturedly.
                         
                          KATE
           You know what I mean.
                         
          Will shrugs, quietly devastated. Goes back to his pizza.
                         
          INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT
                         
          Most of the PATRONS are fixated on an Orioles game blaring
          from a large flat-screen TV.
                         
          At a booth in back, Dwayne and Jay are in deep conversation.
           16.
                         
                          JAY
           I don't wanna stick my nose into a
           family matter...but killing your old
           man? That's pretty messed up...I
           mean, unless you think it isn't.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           What we have here is a classic "lesser
           of two evils" debate. You got one
           evil: me shaving a few years off The
           Major's shitty life. Then you got
           the other evil: The Major ruining my
           entire awesome life by blowing through
           my inheritance. Maybe I'm biased,
           but mine sure as shit seems like the
           lesser.
                         
                          JAY
           I guess I...sorta see where you're
           coming from. And you have been
           waiting around forever for that money.
           You deserve it, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne nods, seriously.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You know, there's a reason I sleep
           'til noon everyday. And it ain't
           'cause I'm lazy. It's on account of
           me having so many goddamn dreams.
           Big ones. And once that money's
           mine, they're all gonna come true.
                         
          Dwayne takes a long sip of beer, contemplative.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Like I had this one dream last night.
           I was cruising through town in a
           Lamborghini Diablo. The wind was
           blowing through my hair, ruffling my
           open shirt. There was a hot little
           piece of ass sitting next to me. And
           in the back seat, Jay...was you.
           Strapped. Wearing a pair of Oakleys.
                         
                          JAY
           Wow. I didn't know you dreamt about
           me, Dwayne.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It was only this once, Jay. To be
           honest, I didn't know what to make
           of it. So I consulted my dream book,
           and found out it means this: you're
           my road dog. You got my back.

           17.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           That's why I want to make you my
           partner.
                         
                          JAY
           In what?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           In crime. And business. You see, it
           ain't just about the inheritance money.
           It's about what I'm gonna do with it.
                         
          Dwayne leans across the table.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm about to clue you in on something.
           And then you'll understand the true
           magnitude of what's at stake here.
           Are you ready?
                         
                          JAY
           Yes. I'm totally ready.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Then answer me this...what's this
           town missing? I'll give you a hint.
           It's a cash business, crawling with
           sexy bitches.
                         
                          JAY
                          (BEAT)
           A Chinese food restaurant?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No. A tanning salon.
                          (BEAT)
           Think about it. All that green.
           All that brown flesh.
                         
          Jay nods, thinking about. He smiles.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's also the perfect front for a
           prostitution ring.
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah, of course. Because of the booths.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yes. And because of the bitches.
                          (BEAT)
           It can all be ours. 30 percent for
           you, 70 percent for me. You just
           gotta help me out here.
           18.
                         
          Jay looks conflicted. Dwayne goes dark, like a spurned lover.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm starting to wonder if my dream
           book was wrong about you. Maybe you
           sitting behind me doesn't mean you're
           my road dog. Maybe it means you're
           plotting to stab me in the back,
           like some snake in the grass.
                         
                          JAY
           That's crazy. I'd never do something
           like that. The dream book was right!
                         
          Jay looks Dwayne in the eyes, knows it's all or nothing...
                         
                          JAY
           Ok. I'll do it. But I'm not shooting
           him or anything. I'll hold him while
           you shoot him. That's it.
                         
          Dwayne chuckles.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Here's a fact: they don't build prisons
           for criminals, they build them for
           idiots. Shit, they got three different
           types of CSI on TV, just laying out
           how the police do their business...and
           still, idiots like you think you can
           just go out and do a murder yourself.
                          (BEAT)
           If you wanna be a millionaire, you
           gotta think like one. And
           millionaires don't kill people.
           They hire assassins. Which I did.
           We gotta pay him on Tuesday.
                         
                          JAY
           What? Why would you do that?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I was presented with an opportunity.
           I took it. 100 thousand bucks for a
           highly trained assassin is a steal.
                         
                          JAY
           But we don't have that kinda money.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Now we're addressing the real problem:
           how do we get the 100 grand? 'Cause
           once we get that, we get the million.

                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           And once we get the million, we will
           literally own this town and every
           single thing in it.
                         
                          JAY
           I guess we could just...rob a bank.
           One of these local banks with nothing
           but a dipshit security guard.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Again, not quite thinking like a
           millionaire.
                         
                          JAY
           Okay, then let's hire someone to rob
           a bank.
                         
          Dwayne thinks about this for a second.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck hiring them, we could just force
           someone to rob a bank for us. Like
           with blackmail, or death threats, or -
                         
                          JAY
                          (ALMOST INVOLUNTARILY)
           A bomb. Everyone's scared of a bomb.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I was gonna say hypnotism...but I
           like that. It's out of the fucking
           box. We just strap one to some
           motherfucker's chest, like we did to
           those watermelons. Think you can
           you build some kinda bomb vest?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah, I mean...camel jockeys do it
           in caves. I got a garage workshop.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm pretty sure this is exactly how
           a millionaire would do it. And the
           beauty of it is: we don't lose any
           sleep, 'cause no one gets hurt.
                         
                          JAY
           Except The Major.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah. The Major dies. But no one
           gets hurt.
                         
          Dwayne smiles. But a nagging thought interrupts him -
           20.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There's just one problem. Where do
           we get our guy? 'Cause if we do a
           kidnapping, then we're right back
           where we started...doing shit that's
           gonna get us caught.
                          (MIND WORKING)
           What we need is someone to come to
           us...to a place where we can control
           the situation. Someone without any
           connection to us.
                         
          The guys stare at each other, stumped. Until something
          catches Dwayne's attention...a local commercial playing on
          the flat-screen. A PIZZA CHEF slides a pizza into a box -

           Giorgio's Trattoria, where the
           customer gets what they want...pronto!
                         
          The guys look at each other.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Sometimes fate just takes out its cock
           and slaps you in the face with it.
                         
          INT. CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          A hand grabs a beer from the fridge.
                         
           VOICE (O.S.)
           You're not trying to draw a psycho
           pension...you really are crazy!
                         
          Will heads into the living room with the beer. The voice
          belongs to Danny Glover. The guys are watching Lethal Weapon.
          Murtaugh (Danny Glover) has just stopped Riggs (Mel Gibson)
          from killing himself. Riggs looks at him, crazily, before -
                         
                          RIGGS
                          (ON TV)
           I'm hungry. I'm gonna get something
           to eat.
                         
          Chet looks over at Will. He is drunk, and in a dark mood.
                         
                          CHET
           Maybe you should pace yourself.
           It's noon on a Saturday.
                         
                          WILL
           Fridge is full, man. We're all good.
           21.
                         
          Will drains half his beer.
                         
                          WILL
           Let me ask you a question. You
           remember Tom Small?
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, he used to kick our asses.
                         
                          WILL
           Turns out he was probably jerking
           off to it afterwards. He's gay.
                         
                          CHET
           I hope he chokes on a dick. I never
           liked him.
                         
                          WILL
           Your sister did. She let him finger
           blast her. Big time.
                         
          Chet pauses the movie.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck are you talking about?
           I don't want that shit in my head.
                         
                          WILL
           Sorry. Kate told me about it last
           night. I thought you should know.
                         
                          CHET
           You two were swapping stories about
           getting fingered? That's pretty cute.
                         
          Chet chuckles. Will ignores him, sips his beer.
                         
                          WILL
           The point I'm trying to make is this:
           Tom Small was an asshole. He was
           totally wrong for your sister. Just
           like every other guy she's ever dated.
           Right through to that Mark dude she's
           gonna get back together with. Un-be-
           fuck-me-lievable...
                         
                          CHET
           Whatever. Why the fuck are we talking
           about who my sister goes out with?
                         
          At a loss, Will shrugs. Chet turns back to the TV, presses
          play. Lethal Weapon resumes. Something blows up. Chet
          pauses the movie and stares at Will for a beat.
           22.
                         
                          CHET
          You sneaky son of a bitch...you want
          to fuck my sister, don't you?
                         
                          WILL
          Chet, I really don't...
                         
                          CHET
          My twin sister!? Which is basically
          like fucking me!
                         
                          WILL
          Hey, if you guys had that twin ESP
          shit this would be a completely
          different situation. There'd be
          logistical problems.
                         
                          CHET
          We look exactly alike!
                         
                          WILL
          You look like a lot of people. You're
          a normal looking dude.
                         
                          CHET
          This is so fucked up I can't even
          begin to process it. How long has
          this been going on?
                         
                          WILL
          If I had to put my finger on
          it...middle school-ish.
                         
                          CHET
          So all those sleepovers, they were
          just some kind of opportunity for
          you to peek in Kate's bedroom?
                         
                          WILL
          It might have happened a few times.
          Most of them were accidental.
                         
                          CHET
          You're a peeping Tom. You realize
          that, don't you? You're a sexual
          fucking deviant.
                         
                          WILL
          Fuck you. I'm as normal as they
          come. Your sister is attractive.
          She excites me, in a sexual way.
          Fucking sue me. Can't we just be
          adults about it?
           23.
                         
                          CHET
           You? An adult? Sort of stretching
           the term.
                         
                          WILL
           Hey, let's not say shit we can't
           take back.
                         
                          CHET
           Take back? Will, you got kicked out
           of junior college for punching a
           professor that made fun of some poem
           you wrote.
                         
                          WILL
           That poem was about your sister!
                         
                          CHET
           That is, literally, the saddest thing
           I have ever heard. Like retards
           playing freeze tag sad. No wonder
           you deliver pizzas for a living.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you! Maybe I was just hanging
           out with you for your sister. You
           were always a whiny little bitch.
           And you stuttered. All the kids
           used to call you "Chutter."
                         
                          CHET
           Whatever. I only started hanging out
           with you because you had a Nintendo.
                         
                          WILL
           Did you see my Nintendo naked?
           Because I saw your sister changing
           into her swimsuit at your thirteenth
           birthday pool party. And it was the
           highlight of the whole shitty event.
                         
          Chet bites his lip.
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. You wanna do this?
                         
                          WILL
           I think we already are.
                         
                          CHET
           Well, you know who I saw naked?
           Jenny Rifkin. While I was nailing
           her. The week after she dumped you.
                          (MORE)
           24.
                         
                          CHET (CONT'D)
           Why do you think every time you wanna
           bet on whose cock's bigger I'm always
           willing to go in? 'Cause I know
           mine's bigger. 'Cause she told me!
                         
                          WILL
           Wow...wow. You pulled a Judas on Jenny
           fucking Rifkin. That is messed up.
           Almost as messed up as how I sold your
           Cal Ripken signed ball for 200 bucks.
                         
                          CHET
           My grandpa left me that ball in his
           will! You helped me look for it for
           a month!
                         
                          WILL
           Now you know why we never found it.
                         
          Will bows.
                         
                          WILL
           We done here?
                         
          Chet's face is red with anger.
                         
                          CHET
           Not quite yet. There's actually a
           mystery I wanna solve for you.
                          (BEAT)
           I was the one who told John Tanner
           about how your mom fucked that
           lifeguard. And I always felt awful
           about it, because even though he
           swore secrecy, he told everyone else
           in town. And then your parents wound
           up getting divorced. But now...I
           don't give a shit.
                         
                          WILL
           What!? You ruined...my fucking life!
                         
          Will takes a swing at Chet. He dodges it and puts Will in
          some sort of choke hold.
                         
                          CHET
           Krav Maga, bitch. I bet your poetry
           professor didn't know this shit.
                         
                          WILL
           Get offa me!
                         
                          CHET
           You threw the first punch!
           25.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna break this hold and then
           kick your skinny ass!
                         
                          CHET
           Try it!
                         
          Will flexes and tries to break the choke hold...no luck. He
          wrenches his back away from Chet and screams -
                         
                          WILL
           What the fuck is that!?
                         
                          CHET
           My knuckle in your spine! No holds
           barred you backstabbing fuck!
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna pass out...
                         
                          CHET
           Good!
                         
                          WILL
           (face bright red)
           I love her, Chet...I love Kate...
                         
          Chet lets Will go. He drops to the floor, panting.
                         
                          CHET
           Let me tell you something. And it's
           the truest thing you'll ever hear,
           from the person who knows you best
           in the world...you're not good enough
           for my sister. And you never will
           be. You're the lowest common
           denominator, Will. You're the square
           root of fucking zero.
                         
          Will gets to his feet.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you...Chutter!
                          (GRABS DICK)
           Square this!
                         
                          CHET
           Get out of my house. You're a shitty
           friend.
                         
                          WILL
           Right back at you.
                         
          Will storms out.
           26.
                         
          EXT. CHET'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Will screeches away in his car.
                         
          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          A day or so has passed. Will sits on his couch, an unshaven
          mess, watching Lethal Weapon 2. Murtaugh and Riggs laugh
          and joke around. Best buds.
                         
          Will looks like he might cry. He goes for his beer, knocks
          it over. He stares at the growing puddle of beer...then
          grabs the folder with his college applications and uses them
          to sop it up.
                         
          INT. GIORGIO'S TRATTORIA - NIGHT
                         
          Will sits at a table, looking out through the misty window.
                         
          Christopher boxes a pizza and drops it in front of him.
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           Come on, wake up and get to work.
                         
          Christopher hands him the order slip. Will checks the address.
                         
                          WILL
           Where the fuck is this?
                         
                          CHRISTOPHER
           How should I know? It's 30 minutes
           away or the pizza comes out of your
           paycheck. Tick tock.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Will's Mustang travels down a dark, empty stretch of highway.
          The lone working taillight fades as the car disappears into
          the distance.
                         
          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang stops at the mouth of a driveway. Overgrown
          shrubbery blocks anything beyond it from view. All that
          Will can see is a red and white radio tower jutting into the
          sky, beacon light flashing atop it.
                         
          Will checks the address, then drives through the open gate.
                         
          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang parks at the end of the driveway. Will gets out.
                         
          There is a large storage shed and, across a clearing, a radio
          tower built on top of a small office structure.
           27.
                         
          The office door is ajar. Florescent light glows from inside.
                         
                          WILL
           Hello?
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           (calling back from beyond door)
           Hey, bud! Sorry for the hike! The
           county's got us doing repairs at the
           ass end of the night!
                         
          This puts Will at ease. He heads toward the office. As he
          gets close, a figure appears in the doorway. It is Dwayne
                         
          WEARING A SCARY FUCKING GORILLA MASK
                         
                          WILL
           What the -
                         
          Will hears something behind him and whirls around -
                         
          To find Jay, also in a gorilla mask, charging at him.
                         
                          WILL
           Holy fuck!
                         
          Will makes a run for it. But the guys are on top of him in
          no time. He madly fights them off and dashes for his car.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Stop! We got a gun, you asshole!
                         
          Will breaks toward the cover of the shrubbery.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck! Get him!
                         
          Jay is right on Will's tail. Without breaking stride, Jay
          picks up a large branch and wings it at him.
                         
          Will is hit in the legs and stumbles over himself. Jay leaps
          on top of him and locks his skinny legs around Will's body.
                         
                          WILL
           What the hell!?
           (at a loss)
           Rape!
                         
          Jay wrestles something from his pocket. A chloroform soaked
          rag. He presses it hard against Will's mouth and nose.
          Will soon goes limp.
                         
          Dwayne appears, looming above them. He pulls his gorilla
          mask back and smiles.
           28.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Step one.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Blurry vision coming into focus. Two gorillas.
                         
          EXT. RADIO TOWER - DAY
                         
          Whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous
          now. Will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at
          his captors. His mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his
          back. He wears his "Giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive
          green Army jacket.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You thought we were gonna rape you.
                          (CHUCKLES)
           Idiot.
                         
          Will mumbles something through the duct tape.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Just shut up. The tape is there for
           a reason. 'Cause this next part is
           gonna take a measure of calm. Are
           you with me? Can you be calm?
                         
          Will nods. Dwayne holds up his driver license.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Will Dixon, of 112 North Whatever-
           The-Fuck Street, right now you are
           wearing an explosive vest.
                         
          Will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get
          his hands loose so he can tear it open.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Calm the fuck down!
                         
          Will stiffens. For emphasis, Dwayne reveals the gun tucked
          down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Now stay still and my associate will
           show you.
                         
          Jay carefully unbuttons the Army jacket. Will is, in fact,
          wearing an explosive vest. It is a cobbled together but
          intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored
          wires. There is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital
          display and a keypad.
                         
          Will begins to hyperventilate.
           29.
                         
                          JAY
           Take it easy, man. You're fine. I
           built this thing. It's pretty stable.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           For a fucking bomb. So don't trip
           over your shoelaces or anything.
           That thing's full of C-4. And the C
           is for chaos.
                         
                          JAY
           Actually, the C stands for "composite."
           But, yeah, I'd try not to slam into
           stuff.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Can I take that tape off now, pizza boy?
                         
          Will nods. Dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.
                         
                          WILL
           Help!
                         
          Dwayne chuckles.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You know where you are? You might
           as well be in space, motherfucker.
           Nobody can hear you scream.
                         
                          WILL
           Why are you doing this to me? I
           don't have any money.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Not yet. But you're gonna go get us
           some.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say.
           I'll go sell my car. I'll get you
           like a thousand bucks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I want 100 thousand.
                         
                          WILL
           Where the fuck am I supposed to get
           that much money?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           The Donner-Wells National Bank on
           Charles Road.
           30.
                         
                          JAY
           Across the street from the Olive
           Garden.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, the one across the street from
           the Olive Garden.
                         
                          WILL
           Do you guys have an account or
           something?
                         
          Dwayne shakes his head like Will is an idiot.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No, I don't have an account! You're
           gonna rob it!
                         
                          WILL
           How the fuck am I supposed to rob a
           bank?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Figure it out. You got a bomb strapped
           to your chest. That's a start. It'll
           scare the fuck outta people. Maybe
           use your brain and go get a gun.
           Borrow one from a friend for all I
           care. It ain't rocket science.
                         
                          WILL
           Then do it yourself.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I would, but I'm already wearing
           this gorilla mask and you're already
           wearing that bomb.
                          (TO JAY)
           Tell him about the vest.
                         
          Jay turns to Will.
                         
                          JAY
           You seem like a pretty trustworthy
           guy. I mean, you got a job and all.
           But just in case you were gonna try
           to take the vest off, we booby trapped
           it to shit. There's also a remote
           detonator on the back, so we can
           trigger it by dialing a number.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           And it's on speed dial. So do what
           you gotta do, but we'll be watching.
                          (MORE)
           31.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           You go anywhere near a police station,
           and Fourth of July comes early this
           year.
                         
          Dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's 9:00 AM. You got 8 hours.
                         
          He hands Will a slip of paper.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Once you have the money, call this
           number and you'll be given instructions
           on where to drop it. You do good, we
           give you the six-digit combination
           that stops the timer and opens the
           lock. Tomorrow morning, you can go
           back to delivering pizza, the mail,
           whatever the fuck you want.
                          (BEAT)
           Now let me demonstrate what happens
           if you don't get us the money.
                         
          Dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged
          with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away.
          Dwayne mimes answering a phone -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hey, Teddy Ruxpin...what's that?
           You don't have the money? It was
           too tough to rob the bank, so you
           just went back to your bear cave and
           cried like a bitch? Well, guess
           what my stuffed friend...time is up.
                         
          Jay pushes a button on a detonator. Teddy Ruxpin explodes.
          All that remains is a cloud of stuffing.
                         
          Will is frozen in fear.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I liked that bear. I don't even
           know you.
                         
          Dwayne throws Will his car keys.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Go on. Get outta here.
                         
                          WILL
           Guys, can we please just talk about
           this?
           32.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, of course we can.
                         
          Dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at Will's feet.
          Jay jumps backward, as does Will, who hits the hood of his
          car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Be careful!
                         
          Will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the
          car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. As he starts the
          engine and backs away -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's right! Get the fuck out of
           here! You're wasting time!
                         
          Once the car is gone, Jay yanks off his gorilla mask. Dwayne
          stays primate.
                         
                          JAY
           What the hell, Dwayne? You told me
           that was a replica gun.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It was. Then I paid a Mexican 50
           bucks to put a firing pin in it.
           Now it goes boom.
                         
                          JAY
           We didn't discuss a loaded gun!
           Especially not with the bomb around!
                         
          Dwayne gets right in Jay's face. The plastic eyes of his
          mask betray no emotion.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Don't you ever question me. I'm
           fucking this bitch. You're just
           holding the camera.
                         
                          JAY
                          (VOICE FALTERS)
           Sure, Dwayne...whatever you say.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Good. 'Cause this ain't the Marines.
           This is cash money. You hesitate, you
           fuck up...and I will leave you behind.
                         
          A tense beat. Dwayne pulls his mask off. He looks oddly calm.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Let's go get some breakfast.
           33.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          Will's car flies down the road. It screeches to a stop,
          tires smoking. Will jumps out, stumbles to the shoulder and
          pukes. He drops to his knees.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, god! Holy shit! Fuck me!
           Someone please fucking help me!
                         
          Nothing but the wind.
                         
          Will fights back tears. He gets to his feet, wipes his mouth.
          He takes out his cell phone, scrolls through the contacts.
          He pauses on Chet's name...presses send.
                         
          The line goes to voicemail. Will looks at the bomb's timer:
          7 hours, 47 minutes and counting. He hurries to his car.
                         
          INT. CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          A laser dot dances around the middle of a United States map.
                         
          Chet is teaching a history lesson to a bunch of SEVENTH
          GRADERS that look very mature and very bored. As he indicates
          with his laser pointer -
                         
                          CHET
           This whole region here, about 830
           thousand square miles, was part of
           the initial Louisiana Purchase.
                         
                          SEVENTH GRADER
                          (COUGHING)
           Nice laser.
                         
          The class giggles. Chet, embarrassed, puts away the pointer.
                         
          There is a knock at the door. Chet turns to see Will's face
          in the door's window pane. He looks back to his class.
                         
                          CHET
           Take out your workbooks. Chapter 3.
                         
          Chet opens the door.
                         
                          CHET
           What do you want?
                         
                          WILL
           We gotta talk.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm working here. Do not mess with
           me at work.
           34.
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, for the love of god, just talk
           to me in private for one minute.
                         
          Chet sighs.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Chet leads a jumpy Will into
                         
          INT. EMPTY CLASSROOM, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Chet shuts the door behind them. Will paces.
                         
                          CHET
           You wanna apologize, don't you? You
           look like shit. You've probably
           been up for days thinking about what
           an asshole you were. Well, it's
           gonna take a lot more than some
           pathetic groveling -
                         
                          WILL
                          (SUDDENLY)
           Chet! Shut up! I don't wanna
           apologize to you!
                         
                          CHET
           Then what do you want? Because we
           don't have anything left to say to
           each other.
                         
          Will swallows hard.
                         
                          WILL
           Here goes. And this is gonna sound
           crazy. Because it is fucking crazy.
           But last night two guys in masks
           jumped me and strapped a bomb to my
           chest, and now I have less than eight
           hours to rob a bank.
                         
          Chet just stares at Will, unimpressed.
                         
                          CHET
           You're hysterical. Got me. Great
           joke. I'm going back to work now.
                         
          Will steps in Chet's way. He unbuttons his jacket, revealing
          the bomb.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck? Is that real?
                         
          Will nods.
           35.
                         
          Chet jumps backward, stumbles over a desk and scurries on
          his ass to the other end of the classroom. He presses himself
          flat against the wall.
                         
                          CHET
           Stay away from me! What the fuck
           are you involved in!? Terrorism!?
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, do you really think I'm a
           terrorist?
                         
                          CHET
           Yes! One of the dumb ones! The
           ones they convince to wear the bombs!
                         
                          WILL
           I am not fucking around here. Two
           guys did this to me. And if I don't
           rob that bank in time this thing is
           gonna blow.
                         
                          CHET
           Seriously?
                         
                          WILL
           Seriously.
                         
                          CHET
           And your first idea was to come to a
           school filled with young children?
                         
                          WILL
           I didn't -
                         
                          CHET
           Just back the fuck away from me with
           that thing.
                         
          Will backs all the way up, so that the guys are on opposite
          ends of the classroom.
                         
                          WILL
           Listen, I think the vest is safe for
           now. These guys don't want me to
           blow myself up on accident before I
           get their money.
                         
                          CHET
           Oh, so you figure the two psychopaths
           that rigged a bomb to your chest
           made sure it was safe? There's no
           margin for error in their fucking
           bomb vest design!?
           36.
                         
                          WILL
           I don't know! All I do know is that
           this is real. This is happening.
           And I'm sure you hate me as much as
           I hate you right now, but I have
           nowhere else to go.
                         
                          CHET
           For what?
                         
                          WILL
           For help, Chet. I need your help.
           Please. I can't do this alone.
                         
          Chet looks Will over. His desperation is palpable. Chet
          bites his lip, weighing the situation...
                         
                          CHET
           Damn it!
           (takes a breath)
           I'd like to tell you to get fucked,
           but you know what the problem is...I'm
           a better man than you. And someday,
           I might actually forgive you. So if
           I let you blow up, or whatever, that
           shit might come back and eat at my
           conscience, and totally affect my
           relationships with other people.
           Like my wife and kids and shit.
                         
                          WILL
           That's a...very rational way to look
           at the situation.
                          (GENUINELY)
           And you're right, about being a better
           guy than me.
                         
          Chet takes a step toward Will.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you sure that thing isn't gonna
           blow at any second?
                         
          Will just looks at Chet...unable to offer any assurance.
          After a beat -
                         
                          CHET
           Could you just walk a few feet in
           front of me for a while?
                         
                          WILL
           I can do that.
                         
          Will opens the door, stops, looks back at Chet.
           37.
                         
                          WILL
           Thank you.
                         
          Will heads out. Chet takes a breath, bracing himself.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          Will walks down the empty hallway. He glances back over his
          shoulder, where Chet walks several feet behind him.
                         
                          CHET
           Yes, I'm still here. I really am
           this stupid. Just pay attention to
           where you're going.
                         
                          WILL
           I think I can handle it.
                         
                          CHET
           These floors get waxed once a week.
           On Tuesday, which today is. You hit
           a slick patch, trip and fall, and I
           got a classroom full of kids wearing
           their skin inside out.
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, I'm fucking nervous enough as
           it is. Please. I don't need you
           back seat driving me right now.
                         
                          CHET
           Obviously.
                         
          Will stops, turns back toward Chet.
                         
                          WILL
           Just for the record, this isn't a
           nuclear weapon strapped to my chest.
           And there are metal lockers on either
           side of the hallway. If I fall, and
           if this thing goes off, I'm probably
           not taking out the whole school.
                         
                          CHET
           Do you really want to debate this?
                         
          Will sighs, turns back around. A second later, the school
          bell rings and kids flood the hallway, changing classes.
                         
          Will freezes. Multiple kids shove past him. Chet sweats
          bullets, gives Will a look of death.
                         
          After a beat, the hallway empties again.
           38.
                         
                          CHET
           You're an asshole.
                         
                          WILL
           Whatever. It's over.
                         
          Will continues walking. He tries to lighten the mood -
                         
                          WILL
           Who was the chick in the white jeans?
                         
                          CHET
           Kristi Evans. Why?
                         
                          WILL
           You know why.
                         
                          CHET
           Oh, come on. Just keep walking.
                         
          The guys' voices fade as they continue down the hallway...
                         
                          WILL
           Come on yourself. You knew exactly
           who I was talking about.
                         
                          CHET
           Fuck you. She's in the eighth grade.
                         
                          WILL
           I bet you love it when she calls you
           Mr. Chet.
                         
                          CHET
           She doesn't call me "Mr. Chet."
           She's not a foreigner.
                         
          EXT. JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
                         
          The guys get to Will's car. Chet wraps up a call on his cell -
                         
                          CHET
           ...thanks so much, Mrs. Davis. I'll
           call you after I talk to the doctor.
                         
          Chet hangs up. He is standing by the passenger door. He
          looks over the roof of the car at Will.
                         
                          CHET
           So, this is it?
                         
                          WILL
           This is what?
           39.
                         
                          CHET
           Once I step inside this car, I'm
           basically in a steel coffin with you
           and...that thing. And if it goes
           off, all they're gonna find in there
           are two charred bodies and pieces of
           a bomb. They'll assume we were driving
           to a government building to blow it
           up. It'll be all over the news.
           Next thing you now, some militia or
           Islam group is claiming us as members.
           My family will be humiliated.
                         
                          WILL
           We'll also be dead, in that particular
           situation, so it won't really matter.
                         
                          CHET
           Exactly!
                         
          Will sighs.
                         
                          WILL
           I get it. Take your time, man.
                         
          Will gets in the car and shuts the door. He looks out at
          Chet, who stands uncertainly by the passenger side.
                         
                          CHET
           This is the world's biggest favor,
           you motherfucker. You didn't even
           help me move last winter.
                         
          Chet reluctantly hops in.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY
                         
          Will fires up the engine.
                         
                          CHET
           Given the situation, I think you
           should obey all traffic safety laws.
                         
                          WILL
           Fine.
                         
          Will pulls out of the school parking lot.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay, so where are we going?
                         
                          CHET
           I have no idea. I just got in your
           car. I thought you had a plan.
           40.
                         
                          WILL
           Well, I don't! I've been sorta
           preoccupied with this crushing fear
           of death!
                         
                          CHET
           No plan. I can't say I'm surprised.
                         
                          WILL
           Your plan is probably better. Just
           condescend me until I explode.
                         
          Will goes to turn on the radio. Chet grabs his hand.
                         
                          CHET
           Maybe we should turn on the radio.
           See if the signal sets the bomb off.
           That would be an interesting experiment.
                         
          Will heaves a frustrated sigh. Chet eases up.
                         
                          CHET
           Listen, let's just go back to my
           place. Figure out our options.
           Maybe you can get the vest off or
           something. I just don't want to do
           anything stupid.
                         
                          WILL
           Unless we have to.
                         
          The car hits a rough pothole. Chet's heart skips a beat -
                         
                          CHET
           Holy fucking shit!
                         
          - and he throws himself against the passenger side window,
          as far from Will as the confines of the car will allow.
                         
          Will slams the brakes.
                         
                          WILL
           Stop it! You're scaring the fuck
           out of me!
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. Okay. Fuck!
                         
          Chet makes the sign of the cross.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm cool now.
                         
          Will continues driving. Chet discreetly unlocks the passenger
          side door.
           41.
                         
                          WILL
           Why did you do that?
                         
                          CHET
           Do what?
                         
                          WILL
           I saw you.
                         
                          CHET
           It's in case I have to jump out.
                         
                          WILL
           If I survive the day, and you don't
           because you jumped out of a moving
           car and broke your neck, I'm gonna
           laugh my ass off.
                         
                          CHET
           And if abandoning ship saves my life,
           then that laugh will be mine.
                         
          The guys continue driving in silence.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 6 hours, 59 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, CHET'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The door is shut. Will sits on the toilet lid. He has the
          jacket off and we get our first complete look at the vest.
          The actual structure is composed of hollow metal tubes. The
          wiring that runs throughout the vest is messy and complicated,
          purposely so, to scare anyone out of fucking with it.
                         
          Will is in the process of trying to contort his arm so he
          can slide the vest off...no luck.
                         
                          WILL
           It's too tight!
                         
          He is calling off toward the
                         
                         KITCHEN
                         
          Where Chet is crouched in a corner, at the furthest point in
          the furthest room from the bathroom. He uses his laptop to
          look for websites on disarming a bomb.
                         
                          CHET
           What if we try to separate your
           shoulder?
           42.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Fuck you!
                         
                          CHET
           Well, all these sites say different
           shit. There's not a lot of consensus
           in the bomb disarming community.
                         
          Will emerges from the bathroom, sliding the jacket back on.
                         
                          WILL
           This is pointless.
                         
          Chet shuts his laptop.
                         
                          CHET
           I agree. We gotta call the cops,
           have them fly in the bomb squad or
           something.
                         
                          WILL
           We can't. These guys said they'd be
           following me. And I don't have a
           clue what they look like. For all I
           know, they're outside right now.
           They see the cops show up, they blow
           the vest and cut their losses.
                         
          Will stares at Chet, hopelessly overwhelmed.
                         
                          WILL
           What do I do, man? What do I do now?
                         
                          CHET
           I don't know, Will...I guess you
           gotta rob the bank.
                         
                          WILL
           I haven't been inside a bank in three
           years! How the fuck am I supposed
           to rob one!? They wouldn't even
           give me a savings account!
                         
          Will drops onto the couch and puts his head in his hands,
          fighting hysterics. Chet offers a stock reassurance -
                         
                          CHET
           It's gonna be okay.
                         
                          WILL
           No, it's not! I'm gonna blow up!
           That's way worse than getting stabbed
           or shot. At least some people survive
           that. No one survives being blown
           up.

           43.
                         
                          WILL (CONT'D)
           No one is ever like, "Yeah, I heard
           Steve got blown up, tough break, but
           how's he doing now? Is he still in
           the Rec basketball league?" No of
           course he isn't, 'cause there's nothing
           left of Steve except a stain on the
           wall and a pair of fucking high tops!
                         
          Chet looks on as his friend begins to sob. It's a crushing
          sight. Chet strides across the apartment -
                         
                          CHET
           Pull yourself together!
                         
          - and attempts to give him one of those "get a grip" slaps.
          But Will flinches and Chet slaps him right on the ear.
                         
                          WILL
           Ow! Fuck! I think you popped my
           eardrum.
                         
                          CHET
           Sorry. Shit. I didn't mean to do
           that. But just listen to me now.
           You're not gonna die. You wanna
           know why? Because you know exactly
           how to rob a bank.
                         
                          WILL
           What are you talking about?

           The movie?
                         
                          CHET
           Yes. That movie is like a how-to
           guide for bank robberies. You just
           bust in. Masks. Guns. Move fast.
           Stick to the tellers and don't bother
           with the vault.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah...I guess it's pretty simple,
           right? And it's just a local bank.
           The Donner-Wells on Charles Road.
                         
                          CHET
           Really? I applied for a job there
           like a year ago.
           44.
                         
                          WILL
           You wanted to be a teller?
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, so what? It's a good job.
           You get benefits.
                         
                          WILL
           Like what, a name tag?
                         
                          CHET
           What kind of benefits do you get?
           Free toppings?
                         
                          WILL
           That's really clever. No one ever
           said that shit to me before. Anyway,
           this is perfect. You know the whole
           layout of the bank.
                         
                          CHET
           Not exactly. They didn't hand me
           the security schematics with the
           application. But I sat in the waiting
           area for like 20 minutes. I know
           what the place looks like.
                         
                          WILL
           How many guards?
                         
                          CHET
           One. I think.
                         
                          WILL
           That's a start.
                         
                          CHET
           It's a great start. You can do it.
                         
          Will pauses.
                         
                          WILL
           You're gonna do it with me, right?
                         
                          CHET
           I was actually gonna stick to giving
           tips, ideas...motivational speeches.
           More of a consultant or advisory role.
                         
                          WILL
           Jesus Christ, Chet. Please. I'm
           begging you here. I need you on
           this. If I do it alone, I'm dead.

                          WILL
           That was a moment of weakness.
                          (BEAT)
           Yes. I'll fucking cry again if that's
           what it takes.
                         
                          CHET
           I should make you blow me.
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. Whip that shit out. I'm
           actually kinda curious. I wanna see
           if Jenny Rifkin lied to you. She
           obviously lied to me.
                         
          Chet cracks a smile.
                         
                          WILL
           All these guys want is 100 grand.
           We can do this.
                         
                          CHET
           We're gonna rob a bank for 100 grand?
           Just leave the rest of the money
           sitting there? Why?
                         
                          WILL
           I don't know. I guess they're very
           modest criminals. Who the fuck cares?
           Wait...you said "we" right?
                         
          Chet heaves a sigh.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm putting my life on the line for
           100 grand...what does 100 grand even
           buy these days?

          Where Juicy waits by the service entrance, smoking a
          cigarette. She spots the car and runs over. It parks and
          the door opens. A glassy-eyed African-American man (30s)
          steps out. His muscled body is covered in calligraphic prison
          ink. This is VAUGHN.
           46.
                         
          Juicy throws her arms around him.

           Well, Marisol...what I want is to
           get my money, kill that old ass man,

          5-Hour Energy drinks.
                         
          The tough REGISTER WOMAN looks at the guys with abject disgust.
                         
                          REGISTER WOMAN
           You sure you don't want to grab some
           condoms?
                         
                          WILL
           Uh, no. Why?
                         
                          REGISTER WOMAN
           Because this is usually what men buy
           before they rape someone, and I want
           to make sure you all use protection.
                         
                          WILL
           Lady, we're just...buying some stuff.
                         
                          REGISTER WOMAN
           Is that cash or credit for your rape
           kit?
                         
          Will looks in his empty wallet, takes out a credit card.
          Chet grabs his hand.
                         
                          CHET
           We'll pay cash.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY
                         
          The van is parked. Dwayne sits behind the wheel. Metallica's
          "Ride the Lightning" begins to play loudly.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You really fucked up this mix tape.
                         
          Dwayne ejects the tape, tosses it at Jay in the passenger seat.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           We're not speed freaks knocking off
           a 7-Eleven. We're masterminding a
           heist here.
                         
                          JAY
           Sorry, Dwayne. That song just means
           a lot to me.
                         
          Dwayne shakes his head. He turns and looks out the windshield:
          they're parked in the Walmart lot, watching the store entrance.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wish he would hurry his shit up.
           48.
                         
                          JAY
           You worried about that other guy
           he's with?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No, man. He picked him up at a
           school. So long as there ain't any
           cops, he can take the whole town
           with him. I just want my money.
                         
          Dwayne surveys the area. Something catches his attention:
          the bland strip mall across the street. There's a Blockbuster,
          Subway, and an empty space in between. Dwayne smiles.
                         
                          JAY
           What? You want me to run over to
           Subway, get us a couple sandwiches?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           If you had any vision, Jay, you'd
           know exactly what I'm thinking about
           right now. And it's not a sandwich.
                          (BEAT)
           Look how well trafficked that shopping
           mall is. It's the perfect place for
           the tanning salon.
                         
          Jay checks it out, nods.
                         
                          JAY
           Oh, you're totally right.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I've been thinking about it, and I
           want you to start off working the
           counter. Sounds like a demotion, I
           know, but it's an important position.
           Because we're gonna be using code
           words and shit. For example, if a
           customer walks in and says he wants a
           tan, that just means he wants a tan.
           But if he says he wants a "deluxe
           tan," that means a blow job and you
           gotta get one of the girls in there
           to suck him off. You with me?
                         
                          JAY
           So far. But what if he wants a fuck?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There's gonna be codes for everything:
           missionary, anal, black chicks. I
           got it all written down back home in
           my files.
                          (MORE)
           49.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           I'm not gonna bother getting into it
           with you right now, because you're
           supposed to be on lookout and you're
           no good at multitasking.
                         
                          JAY
           Okay. 'Cause they're about to get
           away.
                         
          Dwayne spots the Mustang pulling away.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck.
                         
          He throws the van into gear.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Will navigates the streets. Chet is in the back seat, where
          he has newspaper spread out and is spray painting the air
          pistols, and much of the car, black.
                         
                          WILL
           Be careful, you're getting paint
           everywhere.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you really worried about your
           upholstery right now?
                         
                          WILL
           Yes, because if I survive this shit
           I'm quitting my job. That means
           I'll probably have to give up my
           place and I'll be sleeping in the
           back of my car, which you're covering
           in toxic paint.
                         
          Chet touches up one of the guns, goes to flip it over.
                         
                          WILL
           That side isn't dry yet. You're
           about to ruin it.
                         
                          CHET
           It says it's fast drying.
                         
                          WILL
           Fast isn't the same as instant. You
           gotta let it sit for like 20 minutes.
                         
                          CHET
           How would you know? You do a lot of
           graffiti?
           50.
                         
                          WILL
           No, but I spray painted my bike last
           year after I got my license suspended.
           I didn't let it dry properly and I
           fucked it up.
                         
                          CHET
           We don't have time to sit around and
           literally watch paint dry. Aren't
           we going straight to the bank?
                         
                          WILL
           I was actually thinking we need to
           stop and steal a car first.
                         
          Chet drops the spray paint, whirls on Will.
                         
                          CHET
           What? No way! We've got a car.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, my car. I'm not gonna use it
           as a getaway vehicle. They can trace
           the plates. Even if we do get away,
           we'll be arrested.
                         
                          CHET
           Well, I can't hotwire a fucking
           automobile, and neither can you.
                         
                          WILL
           That's why I was thinking we'd steal
           one from your parents' friends. The
           Fishers. Remember how they used to
           pay us to clean their garage? They
           leave the keys in there. And they
           have a Datsun. That's a fast car.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm not stealing the Fishers' Datsun.
           Let's steal a car from your parents'
           friends.
                         
          Will seethes. He whips the car over to the side of the road
          and gets in Chet's face.
                         
                          WILL
           What friends? My parents don't have
           any. My dad moved away after your
           big mouth ruined his marriage and
           humiliated him, and no one wanted to
           hang out with the mom who everyone
           knew fucked a lifeguard.
           51.
                         
                          CHET
           You never should have told me! I
           was 13 years old. I couldn't process
           that kind of information. I had to
           tell someone else.
           (shakes his head)
           Fuck. I really am sorry about it.
           Okay? Despite what I said before.
           I was just a kid, but I messed up.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay.
                         
          Chet looks at Will, expectantly.
                         
                          CHET
           That's it? You're not gonna apologize
           for selling my Cal Ripken ball?
                         
                          WILL
           Sure. I'm sorry...I'm sorry that my
           family was going through a rough patch
           and I was smoking a ton of weed and
           listening to the Wu Tang Clan all the
           time. And that I needed some extra
           dough to indulge my habit. Which, in
           hindsight, was probably just a cry
           for help. But you never even noticed.
                         
                          CHET
           Thanks. Now I feel even worse.
                         
          Will sits there, stewing for a moment. Then he softens -
                         
                          WILL
           I shouldn't have stolen the ball. I
           knew it was wrong and I regretted it
           like the next day. I actually tried
           to buy it back but the guy wanted
           twice as much. I had to smoke even
           more weed just to get past the whole
           shitty incident. I guess that's why
           they call it a downward spiral.
                         
                          CHET
           I appreciate that you tried to buy
           it back. So, thanks.
                         
          An awkward moment passes.
                         
                          CHET
           We should probably get going.
                         
          Will turns back around, goes to pull out without looking and -
           52.
                         
          A horn blares as a speeding delivery truck barrels right at
          them. Will slams the brakes, barely avoiding a collision.
                         
                          CHET
           Fuck! Fuck! I just want this goddamn
           day to be over!
                         
          As Chet continues to freak -
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 5 hours, 15 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Will keeps watch of the house. Chet squeezes through a garage
          window he has pried open.
                         
          INT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY
                         
          Chet drops ungracefully to the floor, right beside a well
          maintained 1977 Datsun 240Z.
                         
          Chet hurries over and unlocks the side door. Will enters,
          hauling the Walmart bag of supplies. He goes right for a
          set of hooks on the wall.
                         
                          WILL
           The keys aren't here. They always
           used to leave the keys out.
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah. When we were teenagers. This
           is fucked.
                         
                          WILL
           Let's just find them.
                         
          The guys ransack the garage. Chet knocks over a shelf full
          of clutter.
                         
                          CHET
           Sorry.
                         
          Will goes to the car and tries the handle. It's open. He
          scours the interior.
                         
                          CHET
           You hear that?
                         
                          WILL
           What?
                         
          Chet peeks through the glass pane in the door.
           53.
                         
                          CHET
           Mr. Fisher is coming!
                         
          As he looks for an escape -
                         
                          CHET
           Oh shit, oh shit. Are the keys in there?
                         
                          WILL
           No!
                         
          Will hops out of the car. He rifles through the Walmart bag.
                         
                          CHET
           What are you doing?
                         
          Will pulls the ski masks out of the bag, along with one of
          the freshly painted air pistols.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm doing what I have to.
                         
          Will puts a ski mask on, then throws one to Chet. The door
          opens and MR. FISHER (60s) enters. Chet quickly pulls down
          his mask. It's backwards.
                         
          Will levels the pistol -
                         
           MR. FISHER
           Oh, Jesus!
                         
          Mr. Fisher braces himself against a wall. Chet fumbles to
          turn his mask around. Will affects a deep voice -
                         
                          WILL
           Where are the car keys?
                         
           MR. FISHER
           They're in my pocket! I'm just
           reaching in my pocket for the keys!
                         
                          WILL
           Quiet down and do it already.
                         
          Mr. Fisher reaches into his pocket and produces the keys.
          They jingle as he holds them out in his trembling hand.
          Will snatches them.
                         
                          WILL
           Now listen, I don't want you to report
           this car stolen or anything until
           later tonight. Let's say 5 o'clock.
           6 to be safe.
           54.
                         
           MR. FISHER
           Sure. Anything you say.
                         
          Will seems unconvinced. He looks to Chet, who shrugs. Will
          turns back to Mr. Fisher and gestures violently with the gun -
                         
                          WILL
           If you fuck with us, I swear, I
           will...I will shoot your son. Taylor.
           I know where he works. At the fucking
           travel agency. He's the douchebag
           with the bangs.
                         
           MR. FISHER
                          (STUNNED)
           Please no. I won't do anything. I
           won't. Just leave Taylor alone.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm gonna trust you. But if you
           call the police, there's gonna be an
           undertaker styling his stupid fucking
           bangs!
                          (BEAT)
           Now open the garage door.
                         
          Mr. Fisher hits a switch that raises the garage door. Chet
          grabs their stuff and gets in the passenger side. Will backs
          toward the driver side.
                         
                          WILL
           The car's insured, right?
                         
          Mr. Fisher nods.
                         
                          WILL
           Okay. I feel better. Worse comes
           to worst, something happens to it,
           you can get a Honda. This thing
           doesn't even have airbags.
                         
           MR. FISHER
           Please, just go.
                         
          Will slides into the car and starts it up.
                         
          EXT. THE FISHERS' GARAGE - DAY
                         
          The car peels away.
                         
          INT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          The guys yank off their ski masks.
           55.
                         
                          CHET
           That old man's got a heart condition!
           You could have killed him!
                         
                          WILL
           My hand was forced!
                         
          Chet tries to get comfortable in the seat.
                         
                          CHET
           Awesome. I'm stuck inside an even
           smaller car with you and a bomb.
                         
          Will works the manual transmission. He steps on the gas.
                         
                          WILL
           This thing's got some pickup.
                         
                          CHET
           Could you just take it easy, we're
           doing fine on time.
                         
                          WILL
           I know...but there's one last stop
           we have to make.
                         
                          CHET
           Do you have to take a piss first?
           Because I do.
                         
          Will nervously drums his fingers on the steering wheel, trying
          to figure out how to say -
                         
                          WILL
           I need to see your sister.
                         
                          CHET
           Are you for real? Did you really
           just ask me that? You salt-in-an-
           open-wound motherfucker!
                         
                          WILL
           Chet, as if it isn't apparent, I may
           die today. I'll probably die today.
           And if there's one small thing that's
           clear to me now, it's that I've wasted
           two and a half decades as a pussy,
           watching everything I want pass me
           by. I don't wanna peace out of this
           world as a pussy. I need to tell
           her how I feel.
                         
                          CHET
           You're really gonna turn this into
           some sort of dying wish bullshit?
           56.
                         
                          WILL
           Yes, I really am. It means that much
           to me. I am not fucking around here.
                         
                          CHET
           I don't think you are. I mean,
           apparently, you love my sister so
           much that you're willing to put her
           life in danger by going to see her
           with a bomb strapped to your chest.
                         
                          WILL
           She won't be in danger. I promise.
           I got it all worked out. And you
           can even take a piss while I'm inside.
                         
          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          The Datsun pulls around and parks in back.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL the minivan parking across the street.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay watch Will hurry out of the Datsun.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Where the fuck is he going? What's in
           there? Some sort of FBI headquarters?
           I told that guy not to fuck around!
                         
          Dwayne pulls out his cell phone, punches in the speed dial
          code. His finger hovers above the send button.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Maybe I should give that bomb a call.
                         
                          JAY
           No! Let me just go see what he's up to.
                         
          Dwayne smirks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I was just fucking around. Are you
           gay for this guy or something?
                         
                          JAY
           I just wanna get the money, Dwayne.
           Same as you.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           All right. Then man up and go check
           it out.
                         
          As Jay reaches for the door handle -
           57.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Don't even tell me you're about to
           do a reconnaissance without a cover.
           What's you cover?
                         
                          JAY
           I don't know...I'm from the telephone
           company?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, nice fucking uniform.
                         
          Dwayne rummages in the back of the car, produces a shopping
          bag and starts filling it with random clothes strewn across
          the car. He shoves the bag at Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You're a personal shopper. You're
           delivering the latest fashions to Mr.
           Quilby in marketing. Got it?
                         
          Jay nods, hops out with the bag and slams the door.
                         
          Dwayne looks down at the cell phone in his hand, twirls it
          as he hums a revival song...sings the lyrics, softly -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           "He's got the whole world in his
           hands. He's got whole fucking world
           in his hands..."
                         
          INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Will runs up the stairs, a phone pressed to his ear -
                         
                          WILL
           ...no, I'm here right now.
                         
           KATE (O.S.)
                          (OVER PHONE)
           Why are you acting so strange?
                         
                          WILL
           Because strange shit is going on.
           I'll explain everything. Just meet
           me where I texted you.

          You can see the entire shitty town from up here. The access
          door opens and Kate emerges, wind tousling her short hair.
                         
                          KATE

          Will waves at her from where he is standing, way across on
          the other side of the roof. Kate starts toward him.
                         
                          WILL
           Stop!
                         
          Will takes out his cell phone and dials. Kate's phone rings.
          She answers it, confused.
                         
                          KATE
           What are you doing?
                         
          We STAY on Will. We can see Kate, standing 30 feet away,
          but her voice comes over Will's cell phone, with a delay
          that is slightly jarring.
                         
                          WILL
           Just don't come any closer.
                         
                          KATE
           Why not? What's going on?

           Some very bad guys strapped a bomb

           I wish I was joking, but I'm not. I
           know it's a lot to swallow, but you
           gotta take it on face value, because
           there's a timer attached to this
           thing and it's counting down.
                         
          Kate's voice falters -
                         
                          KATE
           Oh my god, Will...we'll get help.
           I'll get you help.

           I didn't come here for help. I'm
           taking care of it. I came here
           because, should things not work out
           today as I would like them to, I
           want you to know why I was doing the
           things I did.

           Please, just let me call someone.
           Let me do something. This is crazy!
                         
                          WILL
           I don't disagree with you. It's
           fucking nuts. But that's not even
           what this is about.
                          (STRUGGLING)
           Do you remember when you found that
           picture in my car of you, me and
           Chet, with Chet cut out of it?

                          WILL
           I need you to remember about the
           picture, and about how I stop by
           your office every Friday, and how
           I've always hated all your boyfriends,
           and how the two girls I've ever
           seriously dated have looked like
           less attractive versions of you.
                          (BEAT)
           Do you see where I'm going with this?
           I love you Kate. I have for a very
           long time.
                         
          Kate is barely holding it together.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, this is a lot you're putting
           on me! You just told me people are
           trying to kill you or something, and
           now you say you love me. What the
           fuck is going on?
                         
                          WILL
           A whole lot of shit. I'm sorry to do
           this to you, but I was afraid I'd never
           get the chance to tell you. And I
           know you have feelings for me, too.
           Maybe you feel for me the way you feel
           for a good friend, or - if the world
           fucking hates me - a brother.
                          (MORE)
           60.
                         
                          WILL (CONT'D)
           But what I hope is that you don't really
           know how you feel for me, and that
           maybe when you figure it out you'll
           realize it's the same way I feel for
           you. Does that make any sense?
                         
                          KATE
           Yes. I mean, I've known you forever.
           It's not an easy thing to figure out.
                         
                          WILL
           I don't need an answer now. Just
           think about it. And no matter what
           you decide, you're too good for
           assholes like Mark and the rest of
           them.
                         
          Kate manages a small, stifled laugh.
                         
                          KATE
           Okay. I will process all of this.
           It's just, the bomb -
                         
                          WILL
           It's distracting. I know. Anyway,
           I'd love to stay and talk some more,
           but I can't. I gotta ask you to leave
           now, because I'm running out of time.
                         
          Kate nods. Will hangs up the phone. She turns back toward
          the access door, stops. She yells across the roof at Will -
                         
                          KATE
           If I had time to think about it...I'd
           probably tell you that I've always
           felt very strongly for you. And I've
           never thought of you as a brother.
                         
          Will smiles, yells back -
                         
                          WILL
           That's a huge relief. Don't say
           anything else. I just really don't
           want to die now.
                         
                          KATE
           Try not to. Please.
                         
          Kate turns and continues to the access door.
           61.
                         
          INT. STAIRWELL, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Jay paces about the landing that leads up to the roof. He
          hears the door opening and hurries down to the entrance for
          the nearest floor. He tries the door, but it's locked.
                         
          Kate enters the stairwell from the roof access door and spots
          Jay trying to force the door open. She is holding back tears.
          He just looks incredibly confused.
                         
                          JAY
           I'm, uh...I'm a personal shopper.
           I'm looking for Mr. Quilby.
                         
                          KATE
           I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.
                         
          Kate continues down the stairs, tears coming now. Jay waits
          a beat, then hurries down and tries the door on the next
          level, which is open.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY
                         
          Jay jumps in the van, huffing and puffing.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           So?
                         
                          JAY
           It was just his girlfriend or something.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Getting one last blow job in case he
           don't make it. I kinda like this guy.
                         
          INT. DATSUN - DAY
                         
          Will, galvanized by the exchange, hops inside.
                         
                          CHET
           Did you tell her how you saw her naked
           when she was 13? That always works.
                         
                          WILL
           I said my piece. She's gonna think
           about it.
                         
                          CHET
           Shut up. She was freaked out.
                         
                          WILL
           Yes. By the bomb.
                         
                          CHET
           By you.
           62.
                         
                          WILL
           Would it be so bad if we ended up
           together? You and I would be family.
                         
                          CHET
           I don't want you in the family. You
           bring very little to the table. I
           want her to be with someone awesome.
           A pro quarterback. A war hero. At
           the very least, someone I've never
           watched porn with.
                         
                          WILL
           Well, now it's up to her.
                         
                          CHET
           Not if I set that bomb off myself.
                         
                          WILL
           Then you'd probably never get to rob
           a bank.
                         
          Will throws the car into gear and pulls away.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 4 hours, 10 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          The Datsun is parked in the half-full lot. The guys lean
          against the driver side, with their backs to the bank and
          the car providing cover. They each have a spray painted air
          pistol tucked into their pants.
                         
                          WILL
           You go for the money. I'll cover
           the crowd. In and out.
                         
          Chet clasps his hands around his stomach.
                         
                          CHET
           I'm not feeling so good. I drank
           like three of those 5-Hour Energy
           drinks.
                         
                          WILL
           It's just nerves. Let's pull our
           shit together and do this thing.
                         
          Chet reigns it in. The guys slide on the leather gloves and
          rolled up ski masks. They turn and stride toward the bank.
                         
          The guys stop as they get to the door. They pull the ski
          masks down and take out their air pistols.
           63.
                         
                          CHET
           What should I call you in there,
           like if I need to ask you to do
           something?
                         
                          WILL
           Call me Tivon. You'll be Darius.
                         
                          CHET
           I can tell you're not a black guy
           through the ski mask.
                         
                          WILL
           Fine. Then you'll be Luis and I'm
           Cruz. We're two loco motherfuckers
           and that's the way we gotta roll
           when we get in there.
                         
          INT. DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          It's business as usual for a dozen CUSTOMERS and about as
          many EMPLOYEES. They all just want to get done with their
          shit and go home, when -
                         
          Will and Chet burst through the bank doors, guns in hand.
                         
                          WILL
           Everybody put your hands in the air!
                         
                          CHET
           No, get on the ground!
                         
                          WILL
           Actually, listen to him and get on
           the fucking ground!
                         
          Will and Chet are on an adrenaline high, waving their guns
          everywhere. People scream.
                         
                          WILL
           Shut up! Please!
                         
          Will frantically scans the panicked crowd for -
                         
          The SECURITY GUARD (40s), rail thin and jumpy. Will points
          his gun right at him.
                         
                          WILL
           You, just stand right there and don't
           do shit! The rest of you get the
           fuck down! Spread your arms and legs!
           Why is no one listening to me!?
                         
                          SECURITY GUARD
           Just take it easy, man!
           64.
                         
                          WILL
           Don't be a hero, cowboy!
                         
                          SECURITY GUARD
           What the fuck does that mean? I'm
           not a hero! Or a cowboy!
                         
          As people drop to the ground, whispering nervously to one
                         ANOTHER -
                         
          Chet rushes the TELLERS standing behind the bulletproof glass
          partition.
                         
                          CHET
           All of you, back away from the counter
           and get out here! Anyone pushes a
           button and one of these people gets
           totally shot!
                         
          The Tellers hurry into the main area of the bank and get
          onto their stomachs.
                         
          Will looks to the Guard.
                         
                          WILL
           Very slowly, take out your gun and
           toss it away.
                         
          The Guard takes out his gun, lays it on the ground and shoves
          it away. The gun slides across the waxed floor and -
                         
          Right into the outstretched hand of a sobbing MOM (40s),
          whose DAUGHTER (11) lies beside her in a soccer uniform.
                         
                          MOM
           Oh, god! I don't want the gun!
                         
                          WILL
                          (TO GUARD)
           What the fuck!? Did you do that on
           purpose!?
                         
                          SECURITY GUARD
           It was an accident!
                         
                          CHET
           Are you guys working together?
                         
                          MOM
           No! Please take this gun away!
                         
                          WILL
           Just toss it, lady!
           65.
                         
          The Mom slides the gun away like it were on fire. It skids
          all the way across the floor, slams hard against a wall and
                         
          BLAM!
                         
           MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
           Ah!
                         
          A FAT MAN has been shot. He clutches his thigh.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           I think she got the femoral artery!
                         
                          MOM
           I'm sorry! It was an accident!
                         
                          FAT MAN
           Fuck you! Who slides a gun like that!?
                         
                          DAUGHTER
           Mommy, what's happening!?
                         
                          MOM
           Christi, be quiet. These men are
           dangerous.
                         
          Chet turns ashen. He moves close to Will, whispers urgently -
                         
                          CHET
           This is fucked. That dude is gonna
           bleed out and we're gonna go to prison.
                         
                          WILL
           Just calm down.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           Why is no one getting me help!?
                         
                          WILL
           Is anyone here a doctor?
                         
          Nothing. Just the heavy breathing of many frightened people.
                         
          Will hurries over to the Fat Man, who is bent over, hugging
          his leg.
                         
                          WILL
           Sir, let me see where you're hit.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           Just call me an ambulance!
                         
                          WILL
           Calm down, sir.
           66.
                         
          The Fat Man sits up, removes his hand from his leg. Will
          nervously takes a look. There is only a small amount of
          blood.
                         
                          WILL
           It's just a flesh wound. You're
           gonna be okay.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           But it hurts so bad.
                         
                          WILL
           You got shot, man. It's not supposed
           to feel good. But you're gonna be
           fine. And you'll have a great story
           to tell everyone.
                         
                          FAT MAN
           This is an awful story! This isn't a
           bank error in my favor! I got shot!
                         
                          WILL
           Point taken. Luis, how we doing on
           the money?
                         
          Chet snaps back to attention -
                         
                          CHET
           Oh, shit. Sorry, Cruz.
                         
          Chet picks out the most harmless looking teller, a mousy 20-
          something girl, and helps her up off the ground. He checks
          her name tag: SANDRA.
                         
                          CHET
           Hey, Sandra. I know you're probably
           scared right now, but if you go grab
           us 100 grand in a bag, we'll get out
           of here. This will all be over and
           you'll be fine. You trust me?
                         
          Sandra nods. Chet smiles, reassuringly. She hurries behind
          the counter, starts filling a bank bag with cash, as -
                         
                          FAT MAN
           My leg really hurts!
                         
                          WILL
           Can you please hurry up, Sandra!?
                         
          Sandra emerges from behind the partition with the bank bag.
          Will grabs it. He takes a last look at the people spread
          across the floor.
           67.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm really sorry, everyone. I know
           we probably fucked up your day.
           (looks to Fat Man)
           I'm thinking of you in particular,
           sir. Actually, you know what...
                         
          Will crosses to the Fat Man, offers the bank bag.
                         
                          WILL
           Quickly. Peel a few bills. On me.
           Anyone rats him to the cops and I'm
           coming for you. I remember faces.
                         
          The Fat Man hesitantly reaches for the bag. Opens it -
                         
          Red Dye explodes all over his face. He shrieks. Chet whirls
          on the teller.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck was that about, Sandra?
           I thought we had something going!
           What happened to trust?
                         
                          SANDRA
           I'm sorry! They make us do it!
                         
                          WILL
           Could you kindly fill another bag?
           Not a bank bag. A fucking garbage
           bag. And Luis, will you watch her
           this time?
                         
          Sandra hurries back behind the partition with Chet. He dumps
          out the contents of a trash can, grabs the bag and watches
          closely as Sandra stuffs it with cash.
                         
                          CHET
           Okay. That should be enough.
                         
          Chet grabs the bag and hustles out toward Will. They are
          home free, until -
                         
          They hear the wail of approaching sirens outside. They stop
          cold, panicked. Will whirls on the Tellers.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck! Which one of you assholes tripped
           the alarm!? Was it you, Sandra!?
                         
                          SANDRA
           No! It was Mark! He pushed the
           button when you guys came in!
                         
          Another teller, MARK, looks up from the floor.
           68.
                         
                          MARK
           Sandra, you bitch! Now they're gonna
           kill us both!
                         
                          SANDRA
           Fuck you, Mark! You're the manager!
                         
          Will loses his shit -
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck both of you! Fuck all of you!
           I'm a regular guy! Just like you!
           I'm a regular guy and you fucked me!
           Thank you for fucking a regular guy!
                         
          People are freaked out. Sandra is crying, thinking she will
          probably get shot now.
                         
          Chet grabs Will and pulls him toward the door.
                         
                          CHET
           Let's just get the fuck out of here.
                         
          The guys slam through the doors, out into
                         
          EXT. PARKING LOT, DONNER-WELLS NATIONAL BANK - DAY
                         
          Just as a lone police cruiser screeches into the lot. Will
          and Chet make a run for it, but the cruiser cuts them off.
                         
          OFFICER ZURMAN (21), a jittery rookie, jumps out of the cruiser
          and levels his gun. The guys reflexively level theirs.
                         
                          OFFICER ZURMAN
           Drop your weapons!
                         
                          CHET
           Don't shoot us!
                         
                          OFFICER ZURMAN
           Drop the guns or I'll have to!
                         
          Chet looks at Will with utter desperation. In the distance,
          they hear the sirens of more cops approaching. Will tosses
          his gun, rips open his jacket and grabs a cluster of wires.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you! You just brought a gun to
           a bomb fight, officer! I pull these
           wires out and we all go! You got
           ten seconds to drop your gun and -
                         
          Zurman doesn't stick around for the rest. He turns and
          sprints away.
           69.
                         
          As the guys make for the Datsun -
                          CHET
           That was awesome.
                          WILL
           He was tempting a desperate
           motherfucker.
          The guys jump in the Datsun and peel out as two more police
          cruisers race toward the bank. The cruisers change course
          and give chase. The Datsun blows right by the parked
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY
          Dwayne watches as the cars speed off into the distance.
                          DWAYNE
           Holy shit! Our boy is causing some
           serious mayhem!
                          JAY
           He's gonna get caught or killed.
          Dwayne whirls on Jay, punches him hard in the shoulder.
                          DWAYNE
           Shut the fuck up! If you jinx this
           with your negativity, I'm gonna strap
           a bomb to your chest next.
          Jay massages his shoulder, pissed.
                         
                          JAY
           Oh, yeah, who's gonna build it?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You are!
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          Whiplash blur as the three cars race by, one after the other.
          Airborne leaves flutter in their wake.
                         
          INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Chet freaks out as they hurtle toward lunchtime traffic.
          Will weaves in and out of cars.
                         
                          CHET
           Shit! This is not cool!
                         
          Will is wild eyed, punching the gas. Chet's head is on a
          swivel. Behind them: police cruisers in hot pursuit. Up ahead:
          the world rushing at them at 80 mph, populated by nothing but
          potential collisions that will result in a fiery death.
           70.
                         
                          CHET
           Maybe we should pull over and
           surrender.
                         
                          WILL
           I can outrun these guys. They're
           not the FBI, they're local cops.
           Just shut up and let me concentrate.
           I do this for a living.
                         
          As they clip the side-view mirror off a Kia -
                         
                          CHET
           You don't do anything like this for a
           living! I am not a pizza, I am a man!
                         
          The cruisers are gaining ground, throttles wide open.
                         
          Will downshifts, spiking the RPMs into the red, as he banks
          a hard right and

          The Datsun explodes onto a crowded street. PEDESTRIANS
          crossing an intersection jump out of its way.
                         
          The cruisers take the turn into town. One makes it. The
          other slams into parked cars.
                         
          INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Will jumps the curb to avoid slow-moving traffic, slams into a
          newspaper dispenser. It flips up onto the hood and crashes
          into the windshield, where it stays lodged.
                         
                          WILL
           Holy fuck!
                         
          Will veers back into the street and blindly plows ahead as
          cars he cannot see swerve to avoid him.
                         
          He finally slams the brakes, the momentum knocking the
          dispenser loose and launching it onto the sidewalk, scattering
          Pedestrians.
                         
          Chet whirls around to see the cruiser flying right at them.
                         
                          CHET
           Go! Go! Go!
                         
          Will steps on the gas. The light ahead turns red.
                         
                          CHET
           Stop! Stop! Stop!
           71.
                         
          Will rolls the dice and blows through the intersection.
          He's lucky. The cruiser behind him is not. It's T-boned by
          traffic in a brutal, crunching collision.
                         
          INT./EXT. DATSUN - DAY - MOVING

                          WILL
           That guy got fucked up.
                         
          In the rushing moment as they cross the intersection, Chet
          glimpses the other cruiser barreling toward his side of the
          car from the perpendicular street. He has a millisecond,
          maybe, to process their impending doom, and then -
                         
          The cruiser smashes into the back passenger side of the car.
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          The Datsun is sent spinning like a fucking top. Its ruined

          Madness. The guys scream as the car continues to slide,
          upside down, out of control. As it slams into a row of
          parking meters, the world goes

          Will blinks back to reality. He's hanging, inverted, by his
          seat belt. The car is a pool of shattered glass. It twinkles
          up at him. Hours could have passed, but it's only been
          seconds. He sucks in air. Satisfied that he is, in fact,
          still alive, he looks over at -
                         
          A battered and bruised Chet, head drooping straight back.
                         
                          WILL
           Chet? Are you okay? Chet!?

                          (ROUSING)
           Oh my god...
                         
                          WILL
           Talk to me.
                         
                          CHET
           I thought you were gonna blow up.
                         
          Will's hands go to the bomb...still intact.
           72.
                         
                          WILL
           No. Luckily your side took most of
           the impact.
                         
                          CHET
           Awesome.
                         
                          WILL
           We gotta keep moving.
                         
          Will unclicks his seat belt and falls to the roof of the
          car. He moves to Chet, unclicks his belt and helps him down.
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          Will emerges from the overturned car. He drags Chet out,
          along with the bag of cash. He glances up to see the OFFICER
          who crashed into them stumbling out of his own ruined car,
          which has turned a fire hydrant into a geyser. Another
          cruiser races to the scene.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, fuck, man. Come on.
                         
          Will pulls Chet to his feet and they take off, rounding a
                         CORNER INTO
                         
          EXT. ALLEY - DAY
                         
          As Will huffs and puffs -
                         
                          WILL
           Chet...I don't know how to tell you
           this...but you got a piece of the
           car in you.
                         
                          CHET
           What!?
                         
                          WILL
           In your back.
                         
          Chet glances back to see a jagged piece of metal sticking
          out of his shoulder blade.
                         
                          CHET
           Ah! Get it out!
                         
                          WILL
           I will.
                         
                          CHET
           Do it now!
           73.
                         
                          WILL
           All right.
                         
          Without breaking stride, Will yanks the piece of metal out
          of Chet's back. He screams.
                         
                          CHET
           Is it rusty? Am I gonna get tetanus?
                         
          Behind them, two Officers turn into the alley in full sprint.
          They are way faster than the guys and soon gain on them.
          Will can barely keep up with Chet.
                         
                          CHET
           Why are you moving so slowly?
                         
                          WILL
           It's a combination of cheap sneakers
           and this heavy fucking bomb on my chest!
                         
          They burst out of the alley, onto
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY
                         
          The guys frantically search for an escape, spot -
                         
          A bus pulling up to a stop down the street.
                         
          They sprint for the the bus, peeling off their ski masks and
          waving as it lazily rolls away from the stop.
                         
                          WILL
           Hey! Over here!
                         
          The bus slows and the guys trip over each other to board it.
                         
          INT. BUS - DAY - MOVING
                         
          The guys fall into seats, gasping for air, a complete mess.
                         
          Will looks out the window to see the Officers emerge from
          the alley and look around for them.
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          A crowd has grown around the crash sites. Fire trucks and
          ambulances are on the scene.
                         
          Dwayne and Jay make their way through the crowd, trying to
          see what's what. Dwayne approaches a RANDOM LOCAL.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You hear what happened to the guys
           they were after?
           74.
                         
                          RANDOM LOCAL
           Sounds like they got away.
                         
          Dwayne and Jay beam.
                         
          EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
                         
          The guys are covered in sweat as they hike along, eyes on
          the lookout. They arrive at Will's parked Mustang. Will
          hugs the car.
                         
                          WILL
           I never thought I'd see you again.
                         
                          CHET
           I thought you hated this car.
                         
                          WILL
           It's actually not that bad. You know,
           as compared to that Datsun. The
           Mustang's got more comfortable seats.
           And it never would have flipped over.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY
                         
          The guys get in. They sit there for a moment, silent except
          for their heavy breathing. Will's eyes go to the garbage
          bag sitting between them.
                         
                          WILL
           There's a 100 grand in there. 100
           fucking grand. Which we stole.
           From a bank.
                         
                          CHET
           I told a bunch of people I was gonna
           shoot someone. I was like "you
           fucking move, and I will kill you
           where you stand!"
                         
                          WILL
           I threatened to blow up a cop.
                          (BEAT)
           And you never said "I will kill you
           where you stand."
                         
                          CHET
           I know. But shit did get pretty crazy.
                         
                          WILL
           Yeah, it did.
                         
          Will starts to get a little emotional.
           75.
                         
                          WILL
           You know, there's no one I would
           have rather taken down a fucking
           bank with. I mean that.
                         
          Chet smiles.
                         
                          CHET
           Me, neither.
                         
                          WILL
           And as for all that shit I said...and
           all that shit I did...I hope you can
           forgive me. We've been friends for
           so long, and I guess you hurt the
           people you're closest to the most.
                         
                          CHET
           I messed up, too. I'm a dude who
           slept with his best friend's ex-
           girlfriend, and destroyed his parents'
           marriage, and sat on the sidelines
           watching his downward spiral. I'm a
           shitty human being. But I'm glad
           you know that now, because you can
           accept me for who I am.
                         
                          WILL
           I do. I accept you. Because you
           accept me.
                         
          Will goes in for a hug. Chet gets lost in the moment, before
          recoiling.
                         
                          CHET
           Woah! You still got a bomb on you.
                         
                          WILL
           You're right. Let's take care of
           that. But you owe me a hug.
                         
          Will pulls the slip of paper Dwayne gave him from his pocket.
                         
                          WILL
           It's all gravy from here.
                         
          Will takes out his cell and dials the number.
                         
                          INTERCUT WITH:
                         
          EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay cross toward a McDonald's. Dwayne stops and
          answers his vibrating cell phone.
           76.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This who I think it is?
           WILL (O.S.)
           Can't you hear the ticking in the
           background?
                          DWAYNE
           You know, you're a pretty funny guy.
           WILL (O.S.)
           Thanks. I'm happy to entertain a
           complete psychopath.
                          DWAYNE
           Now wait a second, you're the murderer.
           WILL (O.S.)
           What's that supposed to mean?
                          DWAYNE
           One of those cops who wrecked his
           car chasing you...he ain't breathing
           no more.
          Will goes white, covers the phone and whispers to Chet -
                          WILL
           We killed a cop.
                          CHET
           You were driving! I'm just an
           accomplice!
                          WILL
           They're gonna hunt us down and kill
           us. Cops don't take this shit lightly.
                         
                          CHET
           I bet he had like eight kids. We
           have to find them and support his
           family forever.
                         
          Dwayne is holding back laughter. Finally bursts out.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           What's so fucking funny!?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm just messin' with you. You didn't
           kill anyone. How'd a moron like you
           manage to rob a bank?
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Jesus! Can we just get this over
           with? Where do you want the money?
           77.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There's a boarded up gas station out
           on Commerce Avenue, past the highway.
           Be there in 30 minutes.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I'll be there in ten.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Then you'll be standing around with
           your dick in one hand, and my money
           in the other.
                         
          Dwayne hangs up. He dials another number -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yo, Juicy, wrangle your boy. Money's
           on its way.
                         
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
                         
          The Mustang shrieks past us.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 2 hours, 58 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          INT. MCDONALD'S - DAY
                         
          Dwayne and Jay sit at a table with a fast food feast spread
          out. Dwayne eats a Big Mac, a look of utter satisfaction on
          his face, a man whom the gods have finally smiled down upon.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I remember the summer after my mother
           passed was the first year they had
           the Monopoly game at McDonald's. I
           musta come here three times a day
           trying to collect all the game pieces.
           Packed on 20 pounds, got acne from
           all the grease. The Major said I was
           the fattest, ugliest 13-year-old he
           ever laid eyes on. But I didn't care,
           I just wanted to win the money and
           get the fuck out of there. So, one
           night, I followed this skinny register
           kid home, jumped him. I kept whaling
           on him, asking him where they were
           hiding the Park Place piece. The
           million dollar prize. But he didn't
           know shit. A year later, The Major
           won the lotto. I asked him for a
           Sega Genesis. He bought me one of
           those paddles with the ball attached.
           78.
                         
          Dwayne goes for a fry, sees his carton is empty and grabs a
          handful of Jay's.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm not ashamed to admit that I've
           gone through some dark times since
           then. Depression. Addiction to a
           variety of shit, which I won't go
           into. I know you must think that's
           pretty silly, especially since you
           manage to get through the day and you
           don't got shit going on as compared
           to me. But that's just the way it
           is. That's life.
                         
          Jay looks pretty affected that Dwayne is opening up to him.
                         
                          JAY
           You know, I've been pretty low, too...
           if you ever want to talk about that
           kinda stuff.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No. I don't. My whole point I was
           trying to make before you interrupted
           me was that that shit is all in the
           past. 'Cause I did it. I finally
           pulled it off.
                         
                          JAY
           We pulled it off, Dwayne. The two
           us. We're a good team.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Are we? Would you do anything to
           protect me, my money, my empire?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah, sure...
                          (NERVOUS)
           I mean, like what kinda stuff are we
           talking about?
                         
          Dwayne takes out his cell, keys in the speed dial code and
          slides the cell across the table to Jay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Would you push the button?
                         
                          JAY
           Why would you want me to do that?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's just a question, Jay. Would
           you? If I asked you?
                          (MORE)
           79.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           I mean, it's no different than those
           watermelons.
                         
                          JAY
           Watermelons aren't alive.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, they are. Not the ones you
           blew up, though.
                         
          Dwayne stares hard at Jay. A tense beat.
                         
                          JAY
           No one gets hurt...right, Dwayne?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Oh, yeah. I forgot about that part.
                         
          Dwayne cracks a smile.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Anyway, he hasn't even made the drop
           yet. I'm gonna go take a shit.
           Stay away from the bathroom. Someone
           could get hurt.
                         
          Dwayne heads off. Jay eyes the cell phone he has left behind.
                         
          EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          Weeds have overtaken the abandoned place. Will leans against
          his parked car, waiting. Chet is nowhere to be seen.
                         
          Will spots Vaughn's Sentra approach. It pulls into the
          station and Vaughn steps. He could not look more menacing.
          Juicy hangs back in the passenger seat.
                         
                          WILL
           Where are the other guys?
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I'm the only guy.
                          (BEAT)
           You got it?
                         
          Will picks up the garbage bag at his feet and walks it over
          to Vaughn. He opens it, looks in.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What the fuck did you do...rob a
           bank?
           80.
                         
                          WILL
                          (INCREDULOUS)
           Yes.
                         
          Vaughn grins.
                         
                          WILL
           Now where's the code?
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I don't have any code.
                         
          Vaughn turns to leave. Will grabs his arm. Vaughn stops,
          looks purposefully down at Will's hand. Will draws back.
                         
                          WILL
           Listen, man, I just want the code.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I don't know what the fuck you're
           talking about.
                         
                          WILL
           The code for the fucking bomb!
                         
          Will opens his jacket. Vaughn takes a sudden step back.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What kind of stupid motherfucker
           wears a bomb to a drop?
                         
                          WILL
           Your boss put this on me.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I am my boss.
                         
                          WILL
           Then give me the code!
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Motherfucker, I don't know no goddamn
           code. Whoever told you I did, lied
           to you. Now step the fuck off, or
           I'll shoot you in the face so you
           don't explode and mess up my boots.
                         
          Vaughn goes to leave again. Will runs ahead of him and gets
          in his way.
                         
                          WILL
           If you don't have the code, I want
           that money back.
           81.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           The only way you're getting this
           money back is if you kill me.
                         
                          WILL
           You don't know what I've gone through
           for that money!
                         
          In an instant, Vaughn has his gun out, aimed at Will's head.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Do I look sympathetic? Now step the
           fuck aside.
                         
          INT. SENTRA - DAY
                         
          Juicy looks on with interest as Vaughn holds Will at gunpoint.
          Then she spots
                         
          EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          Chet creeping up behind Vaughn, from wherever he was hiding,
          clutching a large metal pipe.
                         
          Juicy jumps out of the Sentra.
                         
                          JUICY
           Vaughn, look out!
                         
          Vaughn whirls around toward Chet, just in time to have his
          gun arm smashed by the pipe. The weapon drops from his hand.
          Chet takes another swing, cracking Vaughn across the face.
          He howls, blood spraying, and topples over. Chet goes for
          another swing, when -
                         
          Juicy jumps on him, wildly biting and clawing.
                         
          Will grabs the back of Juicy's track jacket for leverage and
          flings her away. She hits the back of the Sentra and careens
          clear across the trunk.
                         
                          WILL
           Let's go!
                         
          Will grabs the money. Chet kicks Vaughn's gun into the
          bushes. The guys break for the Mustang and get in.
                         
          Juicy gets to her feet, runs right by a dazed Vaughn and
          after the car, which pulls out into the road and leaves her
          behind, screaming and cursing.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Will's mind is racing.
           82.
                         
                          WILL
           What the fuck was that?
                         
                          CHET
           They tried to screw us. You're a
           liability. They were just gonna let
           you blow up.
                         
                          WILL
           Not with the money they won't.
                         
          INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY
                         
          A tidy space, filled with various half-finished devices,
          action figures and heavy metal posters. A low mechanical
          hum registers.
                         
          Dwayne sits on a stool in the center of the garage, while
          Jay carefully trims his hair with an electric clipper. Dwayne
          holds up a mirror to check out his work.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Never comes out this nice when I do
           it myself. You might wanna take some
           more off the top, though. I wanna
           look real professional when I go down
           to the morgue to identify the body.
                         
          Dwayne's phone chimes from a nearby counter. He grabs it,
          looks at the incoming number, slightly concerned. He answers -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You drop the money yet?
                         
                          INTERCUT WITH:
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Will yells into the phone -
                         
                          WILL
           No! I've still got the money! And
           I cracked your friend's face open!
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           Why the fuck would you do that!?
                         
                          WILL
           You lied! You said I'd get the code!
                         
          Dwayne is panicked, covers badly -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I gave him the code. He told me he
           committed it to memory.

           83.
                         
                          DWAYNE (CONT'D)
           He was probably just embarrassed that
           he forgot it. I'll call him up and -
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           You didn't give him shit! I want
           the code now or you'll never see
           this money!
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hold on there, big man. You got a
           bomb on you. I got a cell phone that
           detonates it. You're not exactly
           negotiating from a position of leverage.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I'm holding the money. I blow up,
           and it blows up. Who has the leverage
           now? Go ahead and push the button,
           you idiot.
                         
          Chet freaks out -
                         
                          CHET
           Don't tell him to push the button!
           Pull over! Pull over!
                         
          Dwayne is getting pissed off.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Why don't you watch what the fuck
           you say! I own you! I tell you to
           rob a bank, and you rob a bank. I
           tell you to give me the money, and
           you give me the goddamn money and
           hope I show you some mercy.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I'm tired of this bullshit. I'm
           already dead, right? So fuck you.
           At least I'll die rich. I can't say
           the same for you.
                         
          The line goes dead. Dwayne tears off his haircut smock.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That piece of shit hung up on me!
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Chet grabs the wheel and forces Will to pull over.
                         
                          CHET
           Get me out of this car!

          EXT. ROAD - DAY
                         
          Chet jumps out while the Mustang is still slowing down. He
          runs 20 yards away. Will turns the car off and gets out.
                         
                          CHET
           That was colossally stupid!
                         
                          WILL
           It was a negotiation tactic. He'll
           call back and I won't answer. Then
           he'll call back and I will answer, and
           he'll realize the only way he gets the
           money is if he gives me the code.
                         
                          CHET
           Sure! That seems like a perfectly
           logical pattern of thought! I bet
           that's exactly what he'll do!

          Dwayne tries Will's phone again. It goes to voicemail. He
          explodes like a pack of Mentos in a two-liter of Diet Coke.
          Throws his cell across the room. Overturns a work table.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Does this guy know who the fuck I am!?
                         
          Jay retreats into a corner. Dwayne's a big boy, and he soon
          tires himself out, hunches over, panting.
                         
                          JAY
           Dwayne...you never told me you weren't
           going to give him the code.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           We're not amateurs. He was a loose
           end. I let him live, someday I woulda
           been walking out of my mansion and...
           bam! FBI, CIA, NSA, all converging on
           my front lawn, 'cause a loose end turned
           state's evidence and they got what
           they need to put me away.
                         
          Dwayne shakes his head. Starts digging through the mess
          he's made...finds his phone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck it, Jay. I'll just kill The
           Major myself.
                         
          Dwayne keys in the speed dial code.
           85.
                         
                          JAY
           Don't do it.
                         
          Dwayne looks down at the send button.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You know what they say about a tree
           falling in the forest? Maybe the
           same thing applies to blowing up
           some motherfucker across town. Maybe
           it doesn't even make a sound.
                         
          Dwayne hits send.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Boom.
                         
          But Dwayne notices something...the phone in his hand is
          ringing. He puts it to his ear. The line connects -
                         
           FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
           Hello...who is this...hello...?
                         
          Dwayne snaps the phone shut, looks to Jay, who tries to will
          the beads of sweat back into his pores.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Who did I just call, Jay? 'Cause
           she sounded cute for a bomb.
                         
                          JAY
                          (SWALLOWS HARD)
           Gina Kim. My seventh grade crush. Or
           whoever lives in Gina Kim's house now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Where's the number for the bomb?
                         
                          JAY
           In my head. I switched it out of
           your phone while you were taking a
           shit. You're out of control, Dwayne.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm in perfect control!
                         
          Dwayne charges Jay. Jay holds up the hair clippers like a
          weapon, flicks them on. Dwayne rips the cord out of the
          wall, uses it to yank the clippers from Jay's hand, then
          whips him with the cord.
                         
                          JAY
           Stop it!
           86.
                         
          Dwayne goes to whip Jay again, but Jay moves like a jack rabbit
          and delivers a fierce kidney shot. Dwayne stumbles backward,
          falls onto the couch, groans -
                          DWAYNE
           You asshole...I make you my partner
           and you pull this shit...
                          JAY
           I'm tired of you pushing me around
           all the time! What kinda partner
           does that!?
                          DWAYNE
           Fuck you...I'm gonna piss blood,
           aren't I?
                          JAY
           That's what it said on the internet.
          Dwayne's phone rings in his pocket.
                          DWAYNE
           Go on. Get it out for me. I can
           barely move.
          Jay pulls the cell from Dwayne's pocket...opens it and puts
          it to his ear so he can answer -
                          DWAYNE
           Glad you came to your senses.
                          INTERCUT WITH:
          EXT. BOARDED UP GAS STATION - DAY
                         
          Vaughn has a rag pressed to his swollen, bloody face. Juicy
          is nearby, banged up and dirty. Vaughn yells into his cell -
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Who the fuck do you think you're
           talking to!?
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           I honestly don't know.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Let me give you a hint: your boy
           just jumped me, tossed my bitch like
           a rag doll and split with the cash.
                         
          Dwayne realizes who's on the other line, recovers -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That guy's not my boy. He's a dick.
           I'm sorry for all the, uh, confusion.
           87.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Confusion? The only motherfucker
           that's confused is you. Apparently,
           you think you can fuck me and survive
           the day.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I wasn't fucking you, I was fucking
           him. You gotta understand, you're
           like a pawn in a much larger game
           I'm playing here.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Did you just call me a pawn, you
           stupid fuck!?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I didn't mean it like that. I'm
           just juggling a whole lot of shit.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           I want my money. Right now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That may not be possible.
                          (DELICATELY)
           I just want to put this out there,
           to keep you in the loop...but I may
           need to bump the hit.
                         
          Vaughn paces, furious.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           This isn't a reservation at Sizzler!
           You don't "bump" it! I want you to
           bring me my money right now, to where
           I am standing in this shit hole town,
           bleeding from the motherfucking face!
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           I don't exactly have the money...give
           me some time and -
                         
                          VAUGHN
           The deal's off! You just became the
           hit!
                         
          Vaughn hangs up, tosses the bloody rag to the ground and
          screams in frustration.
                         
                          JUICY
           He lives with his daddy. You already
           got the address.
           88.
                         
          INT. JAY'S GARAGE WORKSHOP - DAY
                         
          Dwayne looks down at his phone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's it. The assassin's gonna
           kill me now. I'm gonna die. Game
           fucking over.
                         
          Dwayne cradles his arms around his wounded kidney, rocks
          back and forth, wallowing in defeat.
                         
                          JAY
           We can still get him the money. Try
           the pizza guy back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Why? So he can fuck around again,
           and I wind up dead, anyway? No.
           I'd rather just sit here. I want to
           die right here on this couch.
                         
                          JAY
           No. We're gonna get that money.
           Just like we planned. All we gotta
           do is get the leverage back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How do we do that? Pizza boy's
           obviously got some kinda death wish.
                         
          Jay gathers his resolve.
                         
                          JAY
           We take the girl. The one he went
           to see. Then he won't try shit.
                         
          Dwayne looks up at Jay with something not unlike awe.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's actually...that's a great
           fucking idea, Jay. It's the best
           idea anyone's had all day.
                         
          Dwayne lowers his head. He removes the gun from his
          belt...holds it out to Jay. Jay takes it. Feels its weight.
          Then offers it back.
                         
                          JAY
           I was just trying to figure out how
           you would do it, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne takes the gun. Struggles to stand. Jay helps him.
           89.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Ok. Then let's do it right. We
           leave nothing to chance. Because if
           we go to prison for this, I won't be
           able to watch out for you.
                         
                          JAY
           Ok, Dwayne.
                         
          Dwayne looks over at a frame backpack hanging from a hook on
          the wall. PVC piping bulges from it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You should probably bring the
           flamethrower, buddy. There's gonna
           be some evidence to dispose of.
                         
          EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY
                         
          Will and Chet sit on the ground, still 20 yards apart. Chet
          checks his watch.
                         
                          CHET
           It's been half an hour.
                         
                          WILL
           He'll call.
                         
                          CHET
           In another 30 minutes I'm calling
           the bomb squad.
                         
          Chet gestures to the vast emptiness all around them.
                         
                          CHET
           These guys obviously aren't watching
           you anymore.
                         
                          WILL
           You know, even if they get the bomb
           squad here in time, and they can
           somehow get this thing off me, we
           still gotta answer for the robbery.
                         
                          CHET
           I'll take the heat with you, Will.
                         
                          WILL
           Nah. I'll tell them I forced you
           into it. That you didn't have a
           choice.
                         
                          CHET
           Thanks, man.
           90.
                         
          Will looks at Chet for a beat.
                          WILL
           That's it? You're not gonna think
           about it a little longer? After all
           we went through...tear down the
           relationship, rebuild it...you're
           gonna let me go to prison alone?
                          CHET
           You offered.
                          WILL
           It was a test. Your grade: F minus.
           You know what the "F" is for?
                          CHET
           To fuck myself?
                          WILL
           You passed that test. Failed the
           important one.
          As the guys continue to argue -
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 1 hour, 28 minutes...
                          CUT TO:
          INT. LAW FIRM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
          Kate walks down a hallway, turns into an office. Two figures
          rush past from the intersecting hallway and duck behind a
          corner.
                         
          Kate emerges from the office and continues into
                         
          INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM, OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
                         
          Kate goes to the mirror, checks herself out. She's been
          crying. She splashes water on her face, then enters a stall.
                         
          The bathroom door opens and Dwayne and Jay enter. Dwayne
          pulls something hairy from his pocket.
                         
          Inside the stall, Kate reaches for some toilet paper...from
          underneath the barrier, she notices two pairs of dirty,
          masculine sneakers. Her breath goes shallow. She takes out
          her cell, quietly opens it. She presses the first 9 in "911,"
          but her keypad volume is on and the phone makes a dull,
          electronic beep that echoes in the quiet bathroom.
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           Why don't you just slide the phone
           under the door, so I don't have to
           kick it open and see you with your
           panties down.
           91.
                         
          Kate slides the phone out. One of the sneakers crushes it.
          She gets off the toilet, arranges her clothing and steps out
          out of the stall. She gasps at -
                         
          The two ominous men standing there in gorilla masks. Dwayne's
          gun is plainly visible, tucked into the front of his pants.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           What's the quietest way out of the
           building? 'Cause I might get excited
           in a confrontation, and you might
           wind up shot in the face.
                         
          EXT. LIVING ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Major is watching reruns of Three's Company. He doesn't
          laugh or remotely smile at any of it.
                         
          The subtle click of a door opening does not escape his finely
          tuned senses.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Dwayne?
                         
          Nothing. The Major gets up and goes to a desk, rifles through
          a drawer and pulls something out. A simple pen. He clutches
          it like a weapon.
                         
          INT. HALLWAY, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The Major creeps along.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Just stay where you are, old man.
                         
          The Major turns to find Vaughn pointing a gun at him.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I'm looking for your son.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Even if I knew where he was, I
           wouldn't tell you nothing.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Don't be stupid.
                         
                          MAJOR
           You know, I saved a black man's life
           in the shit. So if I took yours I'd
           be even.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I see where your son gets his common
           sense.
                          (MORE)
           92.
                         
                          VAUGHN (CONT'D)
           But you might want to readjust your
           attitude, because I ain't fucking
           around. I want Dwayne. I don't know
           why you'd want to protect him, the
           motherfucker hired me to kill you.
                         
          If this news has any effect at all on The Major, he doesn't
          show it.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Just tell me where he is!
                         
          Vaughn pulls back the hammer of his gun.
                         
                          MAJOR
           You think I'm scared of death?
           There's a whole generation of gooks
           that think I'm the grim reaper.
                         
          Vaughn shakes his head. Almost imperceptibly, The Major
          repositions the hand with the pen in it. Vaughn is about to
          squeeze the trigger -
                         
          But The Major beats him to it, clicking the pen, which is
          actually a pen gun. It fires a .22 caliber round into Vaughn's
          neck. He drops the gun and clutches the geyser of blood.
                         
          The Major charges Vaughn, jumps on him and wrestles him to
          the ground, trying to jam the pen into the wound in his neck.
                         
                          MAJOR
           I'll ride you all the way to hell!
           I know exactly how to get there!
                         
          Vaughn reaches for his gun. His fingers curl around it and
          he whips it across The Major's face, knocking him backwards.
                         
          Vaughn scrambles to his feet, gun pointed at the felled Major.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What now, old man!? You can't kill
           me! None of y'all can kill me!
                         
          The Major looks up at Vaughn, once again face to face with a
          loaded weapon.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Go on and -
                         
          BANG!
                         
          The Major goes limp, one searing hole in his chest.
           93.
                         
          Vaughn clasps a hand to his neck to staunch the flow of blood.
          He steps over the The Major's body and continues upstairs.
                         
          INT. BATHROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Vaughn rifles through the cabinets, dumps all of the first
          aid supplies into the sink. He gets to work on his wound.
                         
          INT. DWAYNE'S ROOM, NICE HOUSE - DAY
                         
          The locked door is kicked open. Vaughn, neck crudely
          bandaged, flicks on the lights and looks around the childish
          room. Chinese Fighting Fish swim in a large tank, seem to
          stop and look out at him like guard dogs.
                         
          Vaughn ransacks the place. He finds a desk drawer locked.
          Takes out his gun and blows it open.
                         
          Vaughn pulls a stuffed file folder out of the drawer. Flips
          through it. It's full of details about Dwayne's plan, the
          tanning salon, etc.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Motherfucker has lost his mind...
                         
          He finds a map of the town in the file. Three locations are
          highlighted: the bank, the boarded up gas station, and the
          radio tower. PUSH IN on the radio tower.
                         
          Vaughn stuffs the map into his pocket. He stops before leaving
          the room, turns and shatters the fish tank with the butt of
          his gun. Water spills out and the Chinese Fighting Fish flop
          onto the floor. As Vaughn lifts a boot to stomp them -
                         
          EXT. ROAD - DAY
                         
          Will and Chet are still arguing -
                         
                          CHET
           Look at the upshot, while you're
           behind bars you can finally finish
           your degree. If I was there, too,
           it would just be a distraction.
                         
                          WILL
           Great idea, Chet. Thanks a lot.
           I'll just sit here and figure out a
           fucking major.
                         
          Will stews. After a beat, his hand goes to his pocket.
          It's vibrating. He pulls out his cell.
                         
                          WILL
           Hey, it's them.
           94.
                         
          Will answers -
                         
                          WILL
           You ready to talk now?
                         
                          INTERCUT WITH:
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - DAY - MOVING
                         
          Dwayne drives with his cell pressed to his ear. Jay keeps
          watch on Kate in back. She is blindfolded, hands bound behind
          her back with duct tape.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Yeah, I'm ready to talk. I want my
           money. Meet me back at the radio
           tower in 50 minutes.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           I've barely got an hour left!
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That's the point. I want you on a
           short leash.
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Fuck that. Give me the code first.
           Then you can have your money. You'll
           just have to trust me when I say
           that I don't want it.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Yeah, I'm sure. You just wanna go
           back to your fantastic life. Your
           great job. And that blonde bitch
           with the sexy voice.
                         
          Will's mind jumps to the only logical conclusion. Roller
          coaster stomach drop. His voice cracks as he asks a useless
                         QUESTION -
                         
                          WILL
           What the fuck is that supposed to
           mean?
                         
           DWAYNE (O.S.)
           It means that girl you paid a visit
           to today is sitting in the back of
           my van right now. And it ain't
           exactly consensual.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck you! You crossed a line!
           95.
                         
          Dwayne just laughs, maniacally.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           There are no lines! There's just me
           and you and 100 thousand dollars.
           Once we get that shit in order, you
           can have her back, and your life,
           too. So you're gonna show up where
           I say, when I say. Alone. And if
           you try anything stupid, the two of
           you will be delivering pizzas to
           Saint Peter.
                         
                          WILL
           Let me talk to her.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You got ten seconds.
                         
          Dwayne hands the phone back to Jay, who puts it to Kate's
          ear. She is trembling.
                         
                          KATE
           Will...?
                         
           WILL (O.S.)
           Kate, I'm so sorry.
                         
                          KATE
           It's okay...I'm fine...I'm just really -
                         
          Dwayne snatches the phone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           She's just really gonna die if you
           fuck this up.
                         
          Will absorbs this like a blow to the chest. The line
          disconnects.
                         
                          WILL
           Fuck!
                         
                          CHET
           What happened?
                         
                          WILL
           They have Kate.
                         
                          CHET
           What the fuck does that mean!?
                         
                          WILL
           They took her, man. They must have
           followed us to her office.
           96.
                         
                          CHET
           Damn it! You had to go see her!
                         
                          WILL
           I'm sorry. I messed up...I finally
           messed up worse than I could have
           possibly imagined.
                         
                          CHET
           We gotta get her back, Will. These
           guys are crazy.
                         
                          WILL
           We still got the money. As long as
           we have that, she's alive. Come on.
                         
          Chet grabs the bag of cash. They hustle into the car and it
          peels out, leaving behind a swirling cloud of dust. As the
          sun begins to set -
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 58 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Two menacing headlights come at us on the empty road. They
                         BELONG TO
                         
          INT. SENTRA - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Vaughn holds up Dwayne's map as he drives. He seems to be
          on the right road, headed for the radio tower. He crumples
          the map and throws it in back.
                         
          EXT. SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang stops by the gate to the radio tower. Chet jumps
          out and disappears into the bushes.
                         
          EXT. RADIO TOWER - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang pulls up. Will gets out and looks around the
          deserted place. He holds up the money bag.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm here!
                         
          In the shadow of the nearby shed, the minivan is revealed as
          its interior lights come on. The door opens and Dwayne
          emerges, in his mask.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How much time you got left?
           97.
                         
          Will takes off the jacket and tosses it to the ground. He
          looks at the timer.
                         
                          WILL
           Ten minutes.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Damn. Maybe we should just wait
           around for the money shot.
                         
          The guys meet in a clearing. Dwayne nods at the bag.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           That the money?
                         
                          WILL
           Maybe. Where's the girl?
                         
          Dwayne grins.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           In the van. Maybe.
                         
                          WILL
           Get her out here. You're wasting time.
                         
          Will grips the bag close to him.
                         
          Dwayne whistles. The minivan door opens and Jay steps out.
          Strapped to his back is the frame pack we saw at his workshop.
          A long tube connects the pack to the handle of a metal pipe-
          like device in his hand.
                         
          Jay helps Kate, still bound and blindfolded, out of the van.
          They approach Dwayne and take up position behind him.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, are you there?
                         
                          WILL
           I'm here. It's gonna be okay.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           This is a fucking tearjerker.
                         
                          WILL
           Just let her come over here.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I will. But you should know, my
           associate over there is packing a
           flamethrower.
                         
          Jay aims the metal device he has been holding. He hits a
          button and a pilot light comes on.
           98.
                         
                          JAY
                          (FLAT)
           Just do what we say. Don't mess
           around or anything.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Unless either of you can outrun a 25-
           foot flame.
           (gestures to gun in his belt)
           Or a bullet.
                         
          Dwayne roughly pulls Kate away from Jay and shoves her
          forward. Will grabs her, pulls her blindfold off and pushes
          her behind him.
                         
                          WILL
           Get back.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I gave you the girl. Now give me
           the money.
                         
                          WILL
           How about we get the code out of the
           way first, since this bomb happens
           to be ticking so close to all of us.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Fair enough.
                         
          Dwayne pulls a slip of paper from his pocket.
                         
                          DWAYNE
                          (TAUNTING)
           You ready to be a free man?
                         
                          WILL
           Just give it to me!
                         
                          DWAYNE
           448921.
                         
          Will keys in the numbers. The timer freezes and the lock at
          the hinge opens. Will carefully extricates himself from the
          vest. He lays it down on the ground and steps away from it.
          His shirt is drenched in sweat from where the bomb sat.
                         
          Will takes a final look at the money bag, then throws it to
          Dwayne. He looks inside, smiles. Jay takes a peak.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's so fucking pretty, ain't it?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah. It's awesome.
           99.
                         
          Dwayne looks up at Will.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Okay, you can get out of here now.
                         
                          WILL
           I actually have this sneaking
           suspicion that once we turn around,
           you're gonna put a bullet in both of
           our backs - and this is just a guess -
           burn our bodies.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           They say great minds think alike.
           And in this case, so do we.
                         
                          WILL
           I figured as much. That's why I got
           a gun pointed at you, too.
                          (LOUDLY)
           I got a sniper in the bushes locked
           on you right now.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Do I look that dumb?
                         
                          WILL
           I can't tell, you're wearing a mask.
                         
          Before Dwayne can react, he stops and blinks, something
          shining in his eyes.
                         
                          JAY
           Hey...on your forehead.
                         
          Dwayne's eyes turn upward, just barely making out the red
          dot that dances on his forehead.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Son of a bitch. Well played.
                         
          In the bushes, hidden from sight, Chet carefully aims his
          laser pointer at Dwayne's forehead.
                         
          Will grins at Dwayne.
                         
                          WILL
           We're gonna walk out of here now.
           If you shoot, my sniper shoots. I
           can't guarantee he'll get both of
           you. But he'll definitely get you.
                         
          As Will turns away -
           100.
                         
           VAUGHN (O.S.)
           Hold the fuck up.
                         
          Vaughn emerges from the darkness. He looks at Will.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Wasn't expecting to see you here.
                         
          Without warning, Vaughn cracks Will over the head with the
          butt of his gun. He goes down hard. Kate screams. Vaughn
          points the gun at her and she shuts up.
                         
          Dwayne steps forward with the bag.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           It's all good. We got your money.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           Nice mask, Dwayne. Now throw the
           money over here.
                         
          Dwayne complies. As soon as the bag lands, Vaughn aims the
          gun at him.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hold up. You don't have to do this.
           I just paid you.
                         
          Kate looks on, terrified, an unconscious Will at her side.
                         
          Vaughn's eyes burn a hole through Dwayne.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I've been hit with a pipe, shot with a
           pen, and wasted my whole motherfucking
           day...all because of you and this job.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I don't know what you're talking about.
           Just take the money.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           I will. And then I'm gonna tie up the
           two loose ends in the gorilla masks.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm not a loose end!
                         
                          VAUGHN
           You're a fucking idiot. You are as
           loose as ends get.
                         
          Panicked, Dwayne's eyes flash over to Jay, who tightens his
          grip on the flamethrower handle. Jay catches Dwayne's eye.
          Dwayne nods. Vaughn sees this.
           101.
                         
                          VAUGHN
           What the -
                         
          Jay rears up with the flamethrower. Vaughn couldn't be more
          surprised to see the device Jay is holding spit a massive
          ball of fire at him.
                         
          Vaughn dives to the ground, fires off two wild shots, one of
                         WHICH -
                         
          Nails Dwayne in the shoulder, spinning him backward and
          knocking him off his feet.
                         
          Kate recoils in horror as: Vaughn scurries madly on the
          ground, intermittently firing, while Jay screams and tries
          to torch him with the 25-foot flame. A hand touches Kate's
          shoulder and she whirls around to find -
                         
                          KATE
           Chet!? What are you doing here!?
                         
                          CHET
           Not now. We gotta take off.
                          (LOOKS AROUND)
           Where's Will?
                         
          Kate looks to the empty spot beside her where Will just was.
                         
          Flames inches from him, Vaughn lines up a desperate shot -
                         
          Good news: the bullet only grazes Jay's side. Bad news: it
          keeps going and punches through the flamethrower backpack,
          which happens to be filled with gasoline, which happens to
          have an incredibly low flash point. So the spark from, say,
          a bullet, would cause
                         
          AN ERUPTION OF FLAMES
                         
          Meanwhile, Will pops up behind Chet and Kate, clutching the
          garbage bag.
                         
                          WILL
           I got the money. Let's get the fuck
           out of here.
                         
          They take off toward Will's car.
                         
          Dwayne groggily comes to...no SOUND, just a ringing. The
          first thing he sees: Vaughn storming toward him, god-knows-
          what spewing from his mouth. Vaughn levels his gun -
                         
          It doesn't make a sound for two reasons. The second being
          that it's out of bullets.
                         
          Dwayne fumbles for his own hardware. Muzzle flash.
           102.
                         
          Vaughn drops to his knees. Pulse snatched from him.
                         
          SOUND SLAMS BACK to the tune of Jay's screams. Dwayne looks
          over to see his friend in flames, flailing his arms and
          shrieking. Dwayne's head snaps to the other side, where he
          sees the Mustang's tires peel. He tears off his mask,
          frantically looks around. The money is gone.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           No!!
                         
          Jay disentangles himself from the backpack, the source of
          the flames, but his clothes are now ablaze. In his frenzy,
          he somehow manages to string together two coherent words -
                         
                          JAY
           Dwayne! Help!
                         
          Dwayne gets to his feet as the Mustang roars down the
          driveway. He looks to Jay, then to his minivan. Dwayne's
          face: Two roads diverge in a wood. Which to take?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Goddamn it, Jay!
                         
          Dwayne sprints over to Jay, rips off his jacket and uses it
          to beat the flames down.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Stop, drop and roll!
                         
          Jay hits the deck. Dwayne continues fighting the flames,
          finally falls on top of Jay with the jacket spread and
          smothers the last of them out.
                         
          Jay looks up at Dwayne with puppy dog eyes.
                         
                          JAY
           You came back for me...you said you
           never would.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           You didn't hesitate back there, Jay.
           You did good.
                         
          Jay smiles. Flames overtake the field all around them.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I'm gonna go put a bullet in that
           motherfucker and get our money.
           Think you can get outta here?
                         
                          JAY
           Yeah. Go get him.
           103.
                         
          Dwayne hurries toward the minivan. Jay stumbles up to his
          feet and limps off toward the woods.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          The Mustang travels away from the rising flames.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will's face is a mess of dirt, sweat and dried blood. He
          and Chet stare ahead, completely shell-shocked.
                         
          Kate looks from one of them to the other.
                         
                          KATE
           Uh...I just got kidnapped.
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, that was totally Will's fault.
           In case you want to factor that in
           while you're mulling over the whole
           relationship thing.
                         
                          WILL
           I'm very sorry about the kidnapping.
           This is me, taking responsibility
           for it. Growing up. Like a viable
           life partner.
                         
                          CHET
           This man has spied on you in the
           nude before!
                         
                          WILL
           What? No, I didn't.
                         
                          CHET
           He's lying. He's trying to build a
           relationship on a foundation of lies.
           And it won't stand.
                         
                          KATE
           I just got kidnapped! Can we talk
           about that!?
                         
          Something catches Will's attention: a set of headlights
          rapidly growing larger in the rear-view mirror.
                         
          INT. MINIVAN - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Dwayne's speedometer is buried past 100 mph. His eyes burn
          with intensity.
           104.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will hits the gas.
                         
                          WILL
           Oh, shit. One of those dudes is
           definitely not dead!
                         
          Chet and Kate look out the back window. Chet screams -
                         
                          CHET
           Hurry up! He's already on us!
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Dwayne's car pulls even with the Mustang.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Will looks over at Dwayne, who pulls out his gun and takes
          aim. He flashes a sick grin -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I own this town.
                         
          Before Dwayne can get a shot off -
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          An explosion rocks the minivan from inside. The back end is
          lifted off the ground and the car tumbles over itself. It
          lands on its roof and skids into a ditch.
                         
          INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT - MOVING
                         
          Chet and Kate watch the burning wreck disappear out the back
          window. They are equal parts confused and happy to be alive.
                         
                          KATE
           What the hell was that?
                         
                          WILL
           That was the bomb I carried around
           all day. I reactivated it and put
           it in the back of his van. I guess
           his time was up.
                         
                          CHET
           "His time was up?" Were you thinking
           that up the whole day?
                         
                          WILL
           I was prepared, yes. I can't help
           it if I'm the kind of guy who thinks
           about the future.
           105.
                         
                          CHET
                          (TO KATE)
           He's not that kind of guy. He doesn't
           think about the future. Ever.
                         
                          KATE
           What exactly happened since I saw
           you this afternoon?
                         
                          WILL
           Primarily, we robbed a bank.
                         
                          KATE
           What!? So you're, like, fugitives?
           What do we do now?
                         
                          CHET
           Yeah, Will. What does the future
           hold?
                         
                          WILL
           Nothing good if we stay in town and
           they pin this on us. Kate, I think
           you should put in for that vacation
           time. Right now. If anyone gives
           you a problem, tell them to fuck
           off. There's 100 grand in that trash
           bag by your feet. A third of it's
           yours.
                         
          Kate opens the bag...smiles through the dirt and grime.
                         
                          KATE
           Will, that's -
                         
                          CHET
           Fucked up. Why does she get a share?
                         
                          WILL
           Why do you get a share?
                         
          Chet stews. Will catches Kate's eyes in the rear-view.
                         
                          WILL
           Airport's 30 minutes away. Pick a
           destination. This time it's not a
           practice run.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
                         
          The car zooms off.
                         
          SUPER COUNTDOWN: 0 hours, 0 minutes...
                         
                          CUT TO:
           106.
                         
          EXT. DITCH - NIGHT
                         
          Wind fans the flames of the burning minivan. The shattered
          windshield sprouts another crack...then another, as -
                         
          Dwayne's foot kicks it out. He drags himself from the
          smoldering steel carcass. He is a charred, blood splattered
          mess, but he is alive.
                         
          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
                         
          Dwayne is propped up against a sign, lingering on the edge
          of consciousness. The headlights of a lone pickup truck
          approach. Dwayne feebly waves the truck down for a ride.
                         
          INT. NICE HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          The door opens and Dwayne stumbles through. He has made it
          home. He drops like a puppet whose strings have been cut.
                         
          From where his head has landed on the floor, Dwayne sees
          something odd...long red streaks. He crawls forward on all
          fours to investigate...
                         
          It is a trail of sticky red blood. Dwayne follows it until
          he comes upon its source...the crumpled body of his father,
          lying face down. Dwayne's face: shock and confusion and joy.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad?
                         
          Dwayne inches closer, pokes the body. Nothing.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, are you -
                         
          The body emits a low groan. Dwayne rolls it over. His
          father's face is white, he's lost a lot of blood, but he
          isn't totally spent yet. He struggles to speak -
                         
                          MAJOR
           Dwayne...
                         
                          DWAYNE
           What happened to you?
                         
                          MAJOR
           Some guy...said you hired him to
           kill me.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Dad, I...I'd never...
           107.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Look at you...lip quivering like
           you're getting fucked...be a man.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           I am a man! I killed you, didn't I?
           Now I'm gonna use your money to open
           a tanning salon where they let you
           fuck the chicks.
                         
          This stirs something in The Major.
                         
                          MAJOR
           You mean...like those whorehouses...in
           'Nam...I used to tell you about?
                         
          Dwayne softens at the recollection.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Those were great bedtime stories.
                         
          The Major nods. Opens his hand. Reveals a cordless phone.
          Dwayne looks to the bloody streaks down the hall, leading to
          the phone table. The Major dragged himself the whole way.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Medics are late...probably a couple
           lazy spicks...you tell 'em I said
           so...all right, son?
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Sure thing, pop.
                         
          The Major looks up at Dwayne's bruised face, as if for the
          first time.
                         
                          MAJOR
           Hell of thing...I think I
           may...actually respect you now.
                         
          Dwayne's eyes well up. He reaches out, cradles his father
          as he expires. It's like a very bloody, white trash version
          of the Pietà. Dwayne sobs uncontrollably, until -
                         
          He drops his father and pound-pound-pounds his chest in some
          approximation of a life saving resuscitation.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Get up, you pussy! Come on, soldier!
                         
          PULL AWAY as Dwayne pounds the body and distant sirens grow
          nearer.
                         
                          FADE OUT:
           108.
                         
          BLACK. THE DARKNESS RIPPLES...
                         
          Into waves. It's the ocean, long past sunset. PULL BACK to
          find a lone figure staring out at it, sitting on
                         
          EXT. BEACH - NIGHT
                         
          Will. Shirtless. Could be anywhere.
                         
          Chet approaches and sits beside him.
                         
                          CHET
           Fucking nine dollars to use the
           internet.
                         
                          WILL
           And?
                         
                          CHET
           Police think it was that black guy.
           They found some kind of map in his
           car. And I'm sure racial profiling
           played a part.
                         
                          WILL
           But nothing about us?
                         
                          CHET
           Nope. Guess it's time to head back.
                         
                          WILL
           I was thinking we'd stick around a
           little a longer.
                         
                          CHET
           Why? So you have more time to delude
           my sister?
                         
                          WILL
           Yes. And it'd be easier if you gave
           us five fucking minutes alone.
                         
          Chet stares out at the ocean for a beat.
                         
                          CHET
           You really think she's into you?
                         
                          WILL
                          (SWALLOWS HARD)
           I kissed her last night. No tongue.
           Then you walked in.
                         
          Chet just nods. Will gets up.
           109.
                         
                          CHET
           You're gonna go fuck my sister now,
           aren't you?
                         
                          WILL
           I'll be thinking of you the whole
           time.
                         
                          CHET
           At the very least...be a considerate
           lover. Give pleasure, before taking
           pleasure.
                         
                          WILL
           I think I'm reading you. And I will
           try my best.
                         
          Will heads up a trail that leads to a hotel bungalow. Kate
          opens the door, steps out onto the porch.
                         
          Will stops, looks back at Chet. He whistles. Chet turns.
                         
                          WILL
           You're Riggs! You always have been!
                         
          Chet smiles, shakes his head as -
                         
          Will reaches the porch. He stands close to Kate. His nerves
          clock overtime.
                         
                          WILL
           I lied and told your brother I kissed
           you. I thought it would make this
           easier.
                         
                          KATE
           Here's an idea: pretend you have a
           bomb strapped to your chest. Tick,
                          TICK -
                         
          Will closes the gap and kisses her. After a beat -
                         
                          KATE
           Is Chet watching us?
                         
                          WILL
           Probably. We should go inside. I
           promised him I'd satisfy you.
                         
          Kate laughs, leads him inside and the door shuts to -
                         
                          BLACK

          But they are pushed to one side of the screen, as the other
          side is filled with -
                         
          A lo-fi, 2001-style light tunnel. It deposits us in the
          furthest reaches of the galaxy, where we find -
                         
          A tanning bed. Rotating in orbit. Dwayne's voice booms and
                         REVERBERATES -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           GRAND OPENING SPECTACULARRR!
                         
          The tanning bed explodes, like a star gone supernova. From
          the light and fire and chaos...emerges a logo:
                         
                          MAJOR TAN
                         
          A bad MATCH CUT takes us to the same logo. Camera ZOOMS OUT
          unsteadily to reveal it is a banner above a strip mall
          storefront. We are watching a local commercial with
          appropriately poor production value.
                         
          INT. MAJOR TAN - DAY (LOCAL COMMERCIAL)
                         
          Dwayne walks backward down a hallway while addressing camera
          and trying not to trip -
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Here at Major Tan, our specially
           trained technicians are hard at work
           developing new technologies that
           harness the power of the sun, to
           ensure a cutting-edge tanning
           experience.
                         
          Dwayne enters a tanning room. A man in a lab coat stares
          down at a clipboard, on which a complicated scientific
          equation is written.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           How's it looking?
                         
          The man turns: it's Jay. His smiling face is speckled with
          healing burn wounds.
                         
                          JAY
           It's our most advanced tanning bed
           yet!
                         
          He gestures to a very ordinary looking tanning bed.
           111.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           Hey, don't just take this scientist's
           word for it. The proof...
                         
          Dwayne snaps his fingers. A BAD SPECIAL EFFECT makes him
          disappear, then reappear with a totally orange tan.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           ...is in the tan.
                         
          We follow Dwayne back out into the hallway.
                         
                          DWAYNE
           But Major Tan isn't just about looking
           good. It's also about feeling good.
                         
          Dwayne gestures to another room. The door opens and Juicy
          saunters out in a bikini. A beat later, a RANDOM GUY exits.
                         
                          RANDOM GUY
           That "Deluxe Tan" was fantastic!

                          DWAYNE
           So come on down to Major Tan...where
           we're proud to be a family business.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL...The Major beside Dwayne. He's only
          about four feet tall now, on account of the wheelchair. But
          he's grinning like a jackal, in a POW-MIA cap.
                         
          A SUPERED LOGO appears: Military Discounts Available!

              FADE IN:

              OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

              Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway. A road
              gang clearing brush by the side of the road... Twenty-five
              men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon
              labor.

              THREE GUARDS

              Flank the working prisoners... Mountie hats, shotguns,
              sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it.

              HIGHWAY

              A battered pickup appears...approaches. Suddenly, it coughs,
              shudders, stalls. A big Blackfoot Indian named BILLY BEAR
              gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle.Then he
              begins walking toward the road gang...

              ROADSIDE

              BRADY is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he
              smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him.

                                  BRADY
                        Wonder what reservation they let
                        him off of...

              The prisoner is GANZ who looks up, grins at Brady...

                                  GANZ
                        Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

              Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him.

                                  BILLY
                        Say, buddy, my engine's
                        overheating and I got 30 miles
                        before the next station... Could
                        I get some water out of your
                        cooler?

              Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes...

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe you shoulda stole a better
                        truck, Tonto.

                                  BILLY
                        You got a real big mouth, convict.

                                  BRADY
                        It's okay, chief.  He's just
                        joking...

                                  BILLY
                        How about the water...






                                  GANZ
                        Firewater, Tonto?  Is that what
                        you...

              Billy whirls, swings at Ganz. Both men roll to the ground.

                                  BRADY
                        Hey! Jesus Christ!

              THE OTHER GUARDS

              Seeing the commotion, they run toward it.

              GANZ AND BILLY

              As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz' hand.

                                  BRADY
                        That's a state prisoner,
                        asshole...! Back off...

              ROADSIDE

              Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just 'as one of the other
              officers arrives... Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots
              Brady at point-blank range. Before the other Guards can even
              react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second
              Guard.

              THIRD GUARD

              Still forty yards away... In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet
              from Ganz breaks the nearby ground. He fires, then turns and
              runs for the prison bus.

              GANZ

              Smiling, fires twice. but the range is too great for pistol
              work...

              THE OTHER PRISONERS

              Watching....Then they all scatter in different directions...

              GANZ

              Hefts his weapon...

                                  GANZ
                        Come on...

              He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar
              away.

              INT. BUS

              The THIRD GUARD making a call on the police radio...





                                  OFFICER
                        APO 657, Unit 25 to APO 478t APO
                        657t Unit 25 to APO 478.

                        Go ahead, Unit 25.

                                  OFFICER
                        Escape in progress. Two officers
                        shot off rail crossing 31.
                        Prisoners escaping. Two men, one
                        six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an
                        Indian, the other, Albert Ganz,
                        five-ten...

              FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY

              Several miles from the escape... A big semi parked by the
              side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open. A
              station wagon parked across the road. The pickup appears,
              approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into
              the van. Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside
              the truck and close the big doors.

              STATION WAGON

              Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the
              direction of the road gang.

              BILLY BEAR

              Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses...

                                  BILLY
                        Get ready to duck.

              Ganz dives for the floor. Three police cars go by, sirens
              blaring, lights flashing. They pass the road gang. Ganz
              reappear, smiles...

                                  GANZ
                        You know something? I'm having a
                        real good time.

              HIGHWAY

              The station wagon blasts down the pavement... Becomes a small
              dot on the landscape.

              TRANSITION.

              A DOORWAY - NIGHT

              the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge
              pistol,jack cates, s.F.P.D., a large and powerful man... He
              stealthily moves up a stairwell.






              CORRIDOR

              He stops at the top of the stairs... Listens gun still ready.
              A continuous sound of running water... Cates moves toward the
              bathroom. Rips the door open.

              BATHROOM

              The shape behind the shower curtain freezes. Cates, gun held
              level, moves forward... Rips the shower curtain open.
              Revealing a young and very beautiful woman, ELAINE MARSHALL.

                                  CATES
                        Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D....
                        And you're wanted.

              Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water.

                                  ELAINE
                        What am I wanted for?

                                  CATES
                        I don't answer questions, I ask
                        'em...

              A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol.

                                  ELAINE
                        I don't think your gun's loaded...

                                  CATES
                        This is a .44 Magnum, the most
                        powerful handgun in the world. You
                        gotta ask yourself just one
                        question. Are you feelin' lucky?

                                  ELAINE
                        I still don't think it's loaded.

              Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her
              breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder,
              spins it...

                                  CATES
                        Hey, you're right.

                                  ELAINE
                        You're hopeless.

                                  CATES
                        That's the way I see it, too.

              Be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink, embraces her.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm all wet.






                                  CATES
                        What's wrong with that?

              They both smile.

              TRANSITION.

              BEDROOM

              Cates in bed with Elaine.  She wears his shirt.

                                  ELAINE
                        A guy in the bar called me a dumb
                        bitch today.

                                  CATES
                        What'd you do?

                                  ELAINE
                        Irrigated his face with the shot
                        of J and B I'd just poured him.
                        Then I tried to deck the sucker.

                                  CATES
                        I guess he got the message...

                                  ELAINE
                        Then I sit back and I think, I
                        mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb
                        bitch.  I work in a bar, right?
                        I can't read a list of my academic
                        credentials to every booze-hound
                        that comes in the place... You are
                        what you do...

                                  CATES
                        Positive self-image problem all
                        over again ... You are who you
                        decide you are unless you're the
                        type that lets assholes decide for
                        you.

                                  ELAINE
                        Aren't you the one that thinks all
                        psychotherapy is bullshit?

                                  CATES
                        I do think all psychotherapy is
                        bullshit. But just because I think
                        it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't
                        know something about it.

                                  ELAINE
                        If this is your idea of
                        sympathetic interest in my
                        problems, I'll take brutal
                        indifference.





                                  CATES
                        Hey, you know what I really think?

                                  ELAINE
                        Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

                                  CATES
                        I think you're ashamed to tend bar
                        which is sad because you look
                        great in that outfit they make you
                        wear... You pull down four bills
                        a week which is damn good, and you
                        mix the best Pina Coladas I've
                        ever had... I think that if you
                        need bigger and better things ...
                        then go for em.

              She smiles at him after this. It looks like they'll kiss.
              Their faces are close.  Then she lightly moves back.

                                  ELAINE
                        You oversimplify every...

              He stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her,
              then pulls back...

                                  CATES
                        Some things are simple, right?

              Their faces are very close ... but they don't touch for
              another second.

                                  ELAINE
                        Right...

              Titles continue.

              Tugs churning across the bay... Quiet city streets. Parked
              cars covered with early morning dew... A newspaper truck
              slowly grinds by, drops a bundleand moves on.

              EMBARCADERO - DAWN

              The station wagon pulls up to a young punk, HENRY WONG, on a
              motorcycle.

              Billy Bear smiles and leans out the driver's side window.

                                  BILLY
                        You got somethin' for us, Henry?

              Henry produces some credit cards.  Billy passes them to Ganz
              for inspection.





                                  GANZ
                        How hot are they?

                                  HENRY
                        Hot?  Hey, they're not even room
                        temperature.

              Ganz snorts derisively.

                                  GANZ
                        How ya doin'?

                                  HENRY
                        Can't complain.

                                  GANZ
                        We got a lot to talk about.

                                  HENRY
                        Yeah, old times.

                                  GANZ
                        We'll follow you.  Take it
                        slow,okay?

                                  HENRY
                        Sure, right.

              Ganz pockets the credit cards as Henry wheels away.

              INT.  STATION WAGON

                                  GANZ
                        I want to drive awhile.

                                  BILLY
                        I ain't tired yet.

              INT.  STATION WAGON

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe after we get done with him
                        I'm gonna buy us some girls.

                                  BILLY
                        Whaddya mean, buy?

                                  GANZ
                        Pros.

              Ganz stares at Billy.

                                  BILLY
                        Pay money?

                                  GANZ
                        Yeah, dummy.  Money.





                                  BILLY
                        I never paid for it in my life.

                                  GANZ
                        It's better when you pay... they
                        let you do anything.

                                  BILLY
                        They always let me do anything. I
                        don't want to pay for it.  I never
                        paid for it in my life.

                                  GANZ
                        Just do what I say, okay? We'll
                        pay for the girls and have a good
                        time... Don't you trust me?

              Billy smiles.

                                  BILLY
                        Sure, I trust ya.

              They drive off.

              NORTH BEACH - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

              First light breaks over Telegraph Hill. A quiet row of
              Victorian townhouses now converted into apartments.

              APARTMENT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

              Cates is sprawled across the double bed; Elaine is on the
              verge of falling off the edge. Cates' eyes snap open.  A
              second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off.  He turns it
              off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants. Elaine
              sits up in bed, still wearing Cates' blue shirt... Cates
              picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite
              side, throws the robe to Elaine... She takes off the shirt,
              swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to Jack.

                                  ELAINE
                        You know, if you let me come over
                        to your place once in a while, you
                        could put on a clean shirt in the
                        morning.

                                  CATES
                        What makes you think I have any
                        clean shirts at my place?

              He buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen.

              KITCHEN

              Cates brushing his teeth at the sink, Elaine making coffee.







                                  ELAINE
                        You know, that's my toothbrush,
                        Jack.

              He keeps brushing.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe you ought to buy me one.

                                  ELAINE
                        Maybe I would if I knew when you
                        were coming back.

              He stops brushing, turns and looks at her.

                                  CATES
                        I'm here.  And I've been coming
                        back for quite awhile... Let's not
                        hassle, okay?  And can I have a
                        cup of coffee?  Please.

              She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer... Cates
              pours some whiskey into it from a flask.

                                  ELAINE
                        That's a fairly crummy way to
                        start a morning.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe I got a fairly crummy day
                        ahead.

                                  ELAINE
                        Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe you don't know what the hell
                        you're talking about.

              Cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins
              strapping it on.

                                  ELAINE
                        When you start with that
                        attitude... it's like I don't know
                        who you are.

                                  CATES
                        What do you want to know?  What
                        difference does it make?  I'm the
                        guy in your bed the last three
                        months.  I make you feel good. You
                        make me feel good.  What the hell
                        else do you want from a guy?








                                  ELAINE
                        I wish you'd stop trying to make
                        me mad so I won't care for you...
                        I wish you'd give me a little more
                        of a chance.

              He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell.

                                  CATES
                        I don't have time for this. I
                        gotta go to work.

              She stands frozen... He turns back and looks at her; it's
              hard to apologize.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Look, I'm glad I'm in your life...
                        and hell, with an ass like yours,
                        I figure anything might be
                        possible.

              She is warmed up by the first part, amused by the second; she
              approaches...

                                  ELAINE
                        You know something, Jack, you
                        really are hopeless.

                                  CATES
                        That's the way I see it, too.

                                  ELAINE
                        Call me later.

                                  CATES
                        You sure you want me to?

                                  ELAINE
                        Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

              He moves closer, kisses her..

                                  CATES
                        Thanks for the coffee.

                                  ELAINE
                        I think you forgot this. Hands him
                        his wallet and badge...

                                  CATES
                        Guess people ought to know who I
                        am...

              He turns to go down the stairwell...







                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, wait.  Here...

              She puts a scarf around his neck.

                                  ELAINE
                               (continuing)
                        It's cold as hell out these
                        mornings, and you know what the
                        man said, the coldest winter I
                        ever spent was the summer I spent
                        in San Francisco...

              They don't kiss.  He nods appreciately, the scarf in hand as
              he turns and goes.

              STREET - NORTH BEACH - MORNING

              Cates comes out of Elaine's apartment building, crosses to
              his whipped and battered  64 Cadillac convertible, notices a
              parking ticket stuck under the windshield wiper...

                                  CATES
                        Son of a bitch.

              Shoves the ticket in his coat pocket, gets into the Caddie
              puts the scarf around the rear view mirror, starts the engine
              and guns away...

              CITY STREET

              Cates driving the convertible; he comes down a hill and turns
              toward the East Bay...

              Henry Wong, seated on a park bench. Now very dead, a bullet
              hole in the middle of his forehead. Billy Bear is seated next
              to him on the bench reading the race form.

              GANZ

              Using the telephone at an outdoor booth a few feet beyond the

              STREET - BROADWAY DISTRICT - DAY

              LUTHER and ROSALIE, a young couple, turn a corner.  A dark
              parody of all-American young marrieds.  They are bickering as
              usual.

                                  ROSALIE
                        I liked that carpet we saw.

                        Don't remind me.

                        Whaddya want me to do, go out and
                        steal for the money?  I hated the
                        color anyway; the color sucked...

              Suddenly, Billy and Ganz descend on Luther and Rosalie and
              pull them into their station wagon..

              INT.  STATION WAGON

              Billy has Rosalie by the mouth, gagging her with his big
              paw... Ganz has his gun at Luther's neck.

                                  GANZ
                        Surprise, Luther.

                                  LUTHER
                        Whaddya want?  I thought you were
                        locked up-

                                  GANZ
                        I want the money, asshole, what do
                        you think?  The money that Reggie
                        hid...

                                  LUTHER
                        I don't know what you're talkin'
                        about.

                                  GANZ
                        You want that Indian to snap her
                        neck?

              He mimes the gesture... snap...

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Instead of worryin' about Reggie,
                        you better worry about me...

                                  LUTHER
                        Don't give me this, we were
                        partners.

                                  GANZ
                        Billy, go ahead, break it...

                                  LUTHER
                        No! Don't kill her.  I can get you
                        the money.






                                  GANZ
                        When?

                                  LUTHER
                        I can't get it until Monday.
                        Honest.

                                  GANZ
                        You chickenshit punk...

                                  LUTHER
                        Honest. The place we stashed it
                        opens Monday morning. I can't get
                        it till then. Monday morning,
                        that's when it opens. After that,
                        I'll get the money to you right
                        away...

              Ganz finally takes the gun from the neck.

                                  GANZ
                        I always liked you, Luther. You
                        were always a lotta fun to hang
                        out with...

              Rosalie is rubbing her neck now that she's been released...
              Ganz gestures to Billy.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        We're gonna keep her.

              Luther desperately doesn't like this.

                                  LUTHER
                        Come on, you can trust me. Please.

                                  GANZ
                        You try to mess with us or go to
                        the cops, I promise you, I'll put
                        holes in her you wouldn't believe.

              He smiles at Luther, pinches him on the cheek, shoves him out
              of the car.

              LUTHER

              Stands shivering as it powers away.

              WALDEN HOTEL - DAY

              A small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind Union Square.

              A GREEN COUGAR

              Pulls up across the street.






              INT. CAR

              Tha car arrives in front of the hotel.

                                  GANZ
                        Nice place, huh?

              Rosalie is very nervous.

                                  ROSALIE
                        What are you gonna do to me in
                        there?

              Ganz gives her a casual smile.

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut
                        your throat.

                                  BILLY
                        He's just kiddin', you just keep
                        doin' what I tell ya, you'll be
                        okay.

              They move out of the car, head for the hotel.

              LOBBY

              A FRIZZY YOUNG BLONDE sits behind the desk in a mirrored
              entrance hall.  She reads a lurid paperback. Morning traffic
              streams by outside as Ganz, Billy and Rosalie enter and
              approach the desk.

                                  GANZ
                        We need some rooms for a couple of
                        nights...Okay?

              She smiles at Ganz.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Sure.  We don't get many real
                        customers, ya know?  Most people
                        only stay an hour or two...

              Passes a form across. Ganz signs it, Frizzy glances at his
              signature then takes a key from the rack behind.

                                  GANZ
                        I want her young.  And tall. Nice
                        legs. Legs are important. Then,
                        real thin.  Yeah.  NO jeans-A
                        dress? a nice summer dress.  You
                        know I want her fresh... I'll tell
                        you why, because I been hoein'
                        weeds and makin' license plates
                        for a couple of years... Yeah, I
                        know you don't get it...





              BILLY BEAR

              Sees a couple approaching, he shoves the dead man down on the
              bench and spreads the newspaper over his head.  The body now
              looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night.
              Billy walks over to Ganz.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey, what about me?

                                  GANZ
                        And I need one more for my pal.
                        Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not
                        a turban, you know, a squaw.

              Billy smiles, takes the Polaroid...

              POLAROID

              A close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his
              forehead.

              GANZ

              Takes the photograph back from Billy and slips it into his
              jacket pocket...

                                  GANZ
                        Walden Hotel. Third near Broadway.
                        Tell them to ask for ... uh...

              He takes the hot credit cards out of his pocket, the name
              embossed on the plastic..

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        G.P. Polson...P.O.L.S.O.N....Just
                        be a couple of hours.

              Hangs up. The two men head for a green Plymouth...

              TRANSITION.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Number twenty-seven, Mr. Polson.

                                  GANZ
                        Put them next door, okay.

              She gives him a slightly knowing look.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Sure, hey, you got the whole floor
                        to yourself...

              Ganz sends her back a sharp look.






                                  GANZ
                        Keep your filthy ideas to
                        yourself, lady.

              Ganz picks up his suitcase, walks over to the nearest
              stairwell.  Billy and Rosalie follow...

              TRANSITION.

              STREET

              Bars starting to fill up with mid-day customers... A black
              Chevy cruises past and stops further up the block. Two
              Plainclothesmen, VANZANT and ALGREN, get out of the car. As
              they start toward the Walden...

              THE CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE

              Pulls up near the two men. Cates climbs out of his car and
              walks over to them.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, fellas, what's happening?
                        Radio said you guys had something
                        on...

                                  ALGREN
                        Not much, Jack ... Salesman named
                        Polson had his credit cards
                        lifted...

              Algren nods over to the parking lot opposite.

                                  ALGREN
                               (continuing)
                        One of Polson's cards rented that
                        green coupe.

                                  VANZANT
                        Not too much for a big rough tough
                        gunfighter like you to do on this
                        one...

              Cates smiles at the verbal positioning he's used to with his
              colleagues.

                                  CATES
                        Suspect packed or is this a
                        laugher?

                                  ALGREN
                        Five and dime stuff. Polson said
                        a kid with a switchblade mugged
                        him and drove off on a motorcyle.








                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well, I guess you two are
                        experts at taking boy scout knives
                        away from teenagers...

                                  VANZANT
                        Yeah, we are, that means you can
                        stay outta this one. We don't have
                        any big need for the artillery

              Vanzant's turn to smile.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, I'm just offering to help
                        out... I like to watch real pros
                        work.

                                  VANZANT
                        Help, huh?  Sometimes your kind of
                        help tends to leave the suspect in
                        bad shape.

              Algren...mediator... soothes the competitive situation.

                                  ALGREN
                        Hey, relax ... Jack, you wanna
                        come inside, fine... You can stake
                        out the lobby...

              Cates, a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment, nods...

                                  CATES
                        Fine, it's your show...

              The three men move toward the Walden.

              WALDEN HOTEL LOBBY

              Frizzy Blonde still behind the desk. Still reading the lurid
              paperback. Unaware as Vanzant and Algren approach... She
              looks up as they flash their badges.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Aw, you guys were in last week.
                        You better ask around.  I'm not
                        supposed to be hassled... I got
                        friends.

                                  VANZANT
                        Hey, park the tongue for a second,
                        sweetpants, we just want to search
                        a room.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Not unless you got a warrant.







                                  CATES
                        Maybe you should of been a lawyer
                        instead of a dumb skirt workin'
                        behind a register.

              Frizzy turns to find Cates standing beside her. He nudges her
              aside. Starts going throught the register book.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Aw, come on, what the shit is this?

                                  ALGREN
                        We're looking for a guy going
                        under the name Polson...

              Frizzy sits back down in defeat.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Okay, big deal.  Get it over with.

              Cates finds the name.

                                  CATES
                        Mr. Polson, room 27...

                                  ALGREN
                        Is he alone?

                                  FRIZZY
                        Naw, his sister went up an hour
                        ago.

              Vanzant turns to Cates.

                                  VANZANT
                        Okay, like we said, you stake out
                        the lobby.

                                  CATES
                        Sure. Great. Whatever.

                                  VANZANT
                        You're not missing out on
                        Dillinger. This punk just stole
                        some credit cards.

              Cates watches the two Detectives head for the elevator.

              SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR

              Vanzant and Algren move down the hallwayStop at the far end.
              Both Detectives draw their pistols and approach a door.

              ROOM

              Summer dress and undergarments scatteredon the floor. LISA,
              lies naked under the covers.





              She matches Ganz's earlier requirements.Smoking a cigarette,
              staring at the ceiling. Ganz remains on top of the blanket.
              Still in his shirt and pants watching TV. Three sharp knocks
              at the door. Ganz reacts as if he's received an electric
              shock. His hand goes under the pillow... Comes up with an
              automatic. Shoves it hard into Lisa's stomach.

                                  LISA
                        Hey...

                                  GANZ
                        Shut up.

                                  LISA
                        What the hell's wrong?  I didn't
                        do anything.

              Another knock. Ganz makes her move to the door.

                                  LISA
                               (continuing)
                        What do you want?  What's goin' on?

                                  GANZ
                        Shut up.

              She grabs her dress and tries to pull it on.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Now ask who it is.

              Shoves harder with the pistol.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, ask.

              She calls out.

                                  LISA
                        Who is it?

              CORRIDOR

              Vanzant and Algren stand back from the door. Guns held ready.

                                  ALGREN
                        Police... open up.

              R00M

              Lisa looks from the door back to Ganz. Then at the gun held
              against her. She's petrified.

                                  GANZ
                        Stall.







                                  LISA
                        What do you want?

                                  VANZANT
                        Police business. Come on, open up.

              A smile on Ganz' face. Almost as if he's enjoying the moment.

                                  GANZ
                        Keep stallin'.



                                  LISA
                        Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

              I'll just be a minute.

              CORRIDOR

              Vanzant and Algren waiting. Sounds of movement from within
              the room.

              LOBBY

              Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at
              mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from
              this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy.

              ROOM

              Ganz gestures to Lisa.

                                  LISA
                        Just a second.

              Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the
              connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room.

              BILLY'S ROOM

              Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes.
              She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit.

                                  MEXICAN GIRL
                        Que paso? Que esta pasando? No
                        entiendo...

                                  BILLY
                        Shut up.

              Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with
              an electric dord.  He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.







                                  BILLY
                               (continuing)
                        When I say jump, girl, you better
                        jump.



                                  BILLY
                               (continuing)

              CORRIDOR

              Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob.  Locked. Algren moves
              back, preparing to kick the door down.

              ADJACENT ROOM

              Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol
              and fires. Billy's shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.
              Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off
              three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room. Ganz and Billy run
              for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The
              Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...

              LOBBY

              Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.
              Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.

              CORRIDOR

              Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant's body sprawled across
              the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing
              blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers
              out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the
              elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.
              Cates starts back down toward the lobby.

              ELEVATOR

              Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.
              Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...

              CATES

              Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes
              the next flight in two jumps.

              ELEVATOR

              As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to
              wait as he heads for the lobby.

              LOBBY








              Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He
              slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with
              his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates
              again slams him with his pistol, felling him...

              GANZ

              Slides across the floor.

              CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind
              and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives
              over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.

              LOBBY

              Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates'
              move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for
              safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy
              holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.

                                  GANZ
                        He'll blow her goddamn head off.

              Cates doesn't miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes
              careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.

                                  ROSALIE
                        No. No.

              Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into
              a mirror above Billy's head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun
              pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against
              Rosalie'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They
              face each other across the length of the lobby.

              ALGREN

              Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still
              holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and
              Rosalie.

              BILLY BEAR

              Covers Algren from near the entrance.  He's confused, doesn't
              know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.

              GANZ

              His eyes catch Algren's...

                                  GANZ
                        You.  Drop it and we won't kill
                        her.

              Algren tosses his gun to the floor.







                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn
                        piece.

                                  ALGREN
                        Do it, Cates.

              No response.

                                  ALGREN
                               (continuing)
                        Do it, Cates.  Goddamn it, do it.

              Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.

                                  GANZ
                        Kick it over here.

              Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Get the car.

              Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with
              Rosalie.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Your gun's just like mine.

              He's going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.
              Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates' .44.
              Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates
              twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again
              Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman
              across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.
              Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an
              attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the
              floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun
              skitters out of reach.

                                  CATES
                        You lying son of a bitch...

                                  GANZ
                        What are you talking about? We
                        didn't kill her ...

              Ganz smiles.

              With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a
              wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth
              with both his and Cates' gun. Two bullets crash into the
              booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are
              ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.





              STREET

              Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the
              Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,
              then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.

              PHONE BOOTH

              Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen
              bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates,
              wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to
              the floor.

              LOBBY

              The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as
              he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is
              dead. He cradles Algren's head as he stares at the arriving
              TAC Squad and Patrolmen.

              TRANSITION.

              SQUAD ROOM DAY

              Cates walks in. Several Detectives gather around him.

                                  FAT COP
                        What happened?

                                  CATES
                        Read the report.

                                  OLD COP
                        Two cops blown away by a credit
                        card booster... that don't figure.

                                  CATES
                        No shit.

                                  FAT COP
                        They were good cops.

                                  CATES
                        They were good cops who fucked up
                        and got careless.

              A snotty YOUNG COP paces.

                                  YOUNG COP
                        That's what you say, Cates...

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.









                                  YOUNG COP
                        But that's what you say about all
                        of us all the tine ... we're
                        always the ones fucking up when
                        you tell it...

                                  CATES
                        The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

              Cates looks at the Old Cop.

                                  OLD COP
                        It don't figure.

                                  CATES
                        I need to borrow a piece.

              The OLD COP shrugs... looks in his desk...

                                  YOUNG COP
                        Somebody steals your gun, you're
                        supposed to file a report.

                                  CATES
                        Are you gonna tell me about police
                        procedure?  Do me a favor, don't
                        give me a bunch of crap.

                                  YOUNG COP
                        I guess when two cops die on
                        account of your fuck up you want
                        to keep it as quiet as possible...

              Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands,
              pushes him against a wall... The room goes quiet. Cates cools
              down.

                                  CATES
                        Just shut the fuck up.

              The other cops don't intervene. They just watch.  Cates cools
              down, straightens up. HADEN walks by, or, rather, speeds by.

                                  HADEN
                        Cates, I'll need to see you in
                        five minutes, exactly five.

              The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army .45...

                                  OLD COP
                        Best I can do.

                                  HADEN
                        D'you read me, Cates...

              Haden continues moving away.






                                  CATES
                        Five minutes.  I heard you, your
                        voice carries...

              As Cates is examining the gun, RUTH, a lab technician, enters
              and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near Cates.

                                  RUTH
                        They're still wet.

              Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect
              of a spent bullet.

                                  RUTH
                               (continuing)
                        Lots of people getting shot with
                        .44's lately ... Last year, it was
                        Saturday Night Specials..now it's
                        heavy stuff. People must be
                        getting madder about something.

              Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board
              on the wall. Nearby, at the same time (within Cates' line of
              sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being
              interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off
              the typewriter. Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being
              interrogated in Spanish.

                                  POLICEWOMAN
                        You're an accessory to Murder One,
                        so you're going to have to do a
                        whole lot better than what we got
                        down here, honey...

                                  LISA
                        Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I
                        got there.  He was a trick just
                        like any other for all I knew.
                        That's all there is.  He didn't
                        feel like sitting and talking. He
                        was in a big hurry to get laid.
                        I was with him about an hour...

              Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ...
              drifts toward her... A DETECTIVE comes through, begins
              distributing I.B.M. printouts to Cates, the other nearby
              officers..

                                  DETECTIVE
                        We got a print from the hotel
                        room.  Guy's real name is Ganz,
                        Albert Ganz.  A hitter from back
                        East but he worked out here a few
                        years back.  Armed robbery. Broke
                        out of prison two days ago and
                        capped two of the guards. A real
                        animal.  Wait'll you see this...





              Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes
              over the questioning of Lisa.

                                  CATES
                        Did he give you a return match?

                                  LISA
                        He wasn't interested.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe he didn't like your
                        performance.

                                  LISA
                        Fuck you.

                                  CATES
                        I'll take a raincheck...

              From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos...

                                  RUTH
                        This'll interest you, Jack...we've
                        got something here from your
                        gun... and these are from the
                        first weapon Ganz used...

                                  CATES
                        I don't get it.

                                  RUTH
                        Here.

                                  CATES

              She turns, produces the third photo.  Pins it beside the one
              from the Walden Hotel.

                                  RUTH
                        A perfect match for the markings
                        from the first gun he used... but
                        not from the Walden Hotel... fired
                        at least six hours earlier...at
                        point blank range... right between
                        the eyes.  Found him on a park
                        bench...

              She shows him two more pictures.  Police forensics shots of
              Henry Wong ... very dead on the park bench...

                                  RUTH
                               (continuing)
                        Ya know, there are some very bad
                        people out there in the world.








                                  CATES
                        Look at it this way, Ruth.  If
                        there weren't, what would there be
                        for us to do?

              Lisa continues with the Policewoman.

                                  LISA
                        Anyway... so I got there and took
                        him down.  He started watching
                        television and then you
                        sensational people started banging
                        on the door... that's all...
                        except ... he's gonna give you
                        guys a hard time.

                                  CATES

              Cates looks up as he hears that remark.  Notices KEHOE,
              another Detective, entering with a long suitcase.

                                  POLICEWOMAN
                        What makes you think so?

                                  LISA
                        I think he liked shooting cops a
                        lot more than getting laid.

              Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box.

                                  CATES
                        Is that what this guy Ganz had in
                        the hotel?



                                  KEHOE
                        Every last bit of it.  The big
                        guy's room was empty.

                                  CATES
                        I'll help you out.

              Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase.  Kehoe
              produces a speed loader for a .44...

                                  KEHOE
                        This guy must have had a .44 like
                        yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.

                                  CATES
                        Shit.

              Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.








                                  KEHOE
                        This cat was real serious about
                        his artillery.

              An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file. He opens it,
              shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot.

                                  CATES
                        Billy Bear...

                                  KEHOE
                        Backup man from the East Bay.
                        Worked with Ganz a few years ago
                        and sprung him from the road gang.

              Kehoe opens the second file.  Four mug shots are inside.

                                  CATES
                        Who are all these?

                                  KEHOE
                        They all pulled a bunch of jobs
                        with Ganz about four years ago.

                                  CATES
                        Wait a minute, wait a minute...
                        who's this?

                                  KEHOE
                        Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was
                        in on the same job.

              Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can
              see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.

                                  CATES
                        Tell me that's not the same guy.

                                  KEHOE
                        Hey ... Dick Tracy.

                                  RUTH
                        Did Ganz have a grudge against his
                        old friends?

              Haden comes out of his office.

                                  HADEN
                        Get in here, Cates.

              Cates ignores him.

                                  CATES
                        I think I wanna have a discussion
                        about it with any of the ones
                        still walking.  Can we find them?






                                  KEHOE
                        Here's the file. Cates checks the
                        file.

                                  CATES
                        One of  em's in the slam.

                                  HADEN
                        Damn you, Cates ... Get in here.

              Cates walks into Haden's cubicle.

                                  CATES
                        I want to be left alone on this
                        one. Algren was killed with my gun.



                                  HADEN
                        Yeah, I read the report...

              Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I
                        want it back.

                                  HADEN
                        Jack, come on, there is an
                        official department policy about
                        cop killings. Cop killers
                        represent a special priority
                        because any man crazy enough to
                        kill a cop is a greater threat to
                        an unarmed civilian... In other
                        words, we can't seen like we're in
                        the revenge business... I know, we
                        all know the truth's a little
                        different.

              Cates almost smiles at Haden.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah...

                                  HADEN
                        Anthing botherin' you besides
                        losin' your gun?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get
                        hurt while I'm makin' a play. I
                        don't like it.









                                  HADEN
                        You might be more of a team player
                        and a little less of a hot dog on
                        this one, Jack.

                                  CATES
                        Being a hot dog's worked pretty
                        well for me so far... Besides, I
                        got a lead...

                                  HADEN
                        Okay.  You're not a team player.
                        You gotta do things your own way.
                        Fine.  Nail this guy and make us
                        all look good.  But you better
                        watch your ass.  If you screw up,
                        I can promise you, you're goin'
                        down.

                                  CATES
                        You really know how to send a guy
                        out with a great attitude. He
                        starts to go.

                                  HADEN
                        Jack?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah?

                                  HADEN
                        Try not to get your ass shot to
                        pieces. We got enough dead cops on
                        this one.

                                  CATES
                        I'll keep it in mind.

              Leaves.

              TRANSITION.

              CITY STREET

              Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Cates stands near a hot
              dog stand. Elaine joins him. Cates is eating a hot dog and
              studying a police file.

                                  ELAINE
                        Great place for lunch.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, one of my favorites.

                        Yeah, Guess it must have been a
                        slow news day...

                        Jack, are you okay?

                        Sure, okay, fine, no problem...

                        First thing I got to do is go up
                        and see what he knows ...

              He points to the file.

                                  ELAINE
                        I thought you might come over to
                        my place to recuperate.  I don't
                        have to go to work until the day
                        after tomorrow.

              They begin to stroll down the street.

                                  CATES
                        I got nothing to recuperate from.
                        There's a guy out there with my
                        gun, and I want it back.

              She's not happy with this attitude.

                        Look, spare me the macho bullshit
                        about your gun...

                        Bullshit?  I'll tell you about
                        bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon
                        in the hands of a real maniac who
                        knows how to use it.  It isn't my
                        macho bullshit that's killing
                        people, my gun is ...

                        Look, Jack, if you make everything
                        your personal responsibility,
                        you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's
                        not a practical way to function...

                                  CATES
                        I didn't get burned, two cops did.
                        Listen, I'll tell you about
                        personnel responsibility.  I like
                        to get the job done right.  And if
                        I don't get my job done right...
                        I'm for shit.





                                  ELAINE
                        Here it comes again ... the sacred
                        job...

                                  CATES
                        That's right.  I'm not like you.
                        I'm not gonna sit on my ass
                        wondering what's right and what's
                        wrong... There's a psycho out
                        there killing people with my gun
                        and I'm gonna get him.  Because
                        it's my job. And if you don't get
                        that...

                                  ELAINE
                        I get that. The job first.
                        Everything else, especially me,
                        second. I get it. I don't like it.

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                        No one asked you to like it... But
                        that's the way it is.

              TRANSITION.

              PRISON CELL BLOCK - DAY

              Cates and a GUARD on the upper deck approaching the door to
              the cell block... The Guard shouts upward.

                                  GUARD
                        Open Nine.

              With a huge metal clatters the door to the cell block opens.

              CELL BLOCK - NEAR ENTRANCE

              Cates and the Guard go through the door.

                                  GUARD
                        Close Nine.

              They move forward together.

                                  GUARD
                               (continuing)
                        It's Number Twenty-two... You want
                        company?

                                  CATES
                        No, no thanks.

              The Guard shrugs, stays by the door.







              CATES

              He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from
              inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they
              can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...
              a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and
              taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall
              instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a
              graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods
              to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch
              and the door opens.

              HAMMOND'S CELL

              Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony
              Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain
              pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a
              bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's
              age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He
              doesn't even look at Cates.

                                  CATES
                        Hammond.

              Cates steps inside the cell.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Hammond!

              No answer. Cates leans over, hits the override button on the
              Sony.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Hammond!

              Hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain ... He pulls the
              headset off and glares at Cates.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You got a name, cop?

                                  CATES
                        Try Cates.  And let's talk in
                        private, okay?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Sure, anything you want.

              He tosses the Walkman to Leroy who dutifully puts it on.

                                  CATES
                        Look, convict, I know all about
                        you. Single.  No fixed address. No
                        known relatives.







                        One previous conviction. Armed
                        robbery... six months to go on a
                        three-year sentence.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You here to write my life story?

                                  CATES
                        Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just
                        need some help.

              Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it
              across the table to Hammond.  He looks at it, hardly reacts.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Henry Wong... My old pal.  He's
                        looked better...

              He passes the photo back.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Look, I got just six months before
                        gettin' out of here.  Six months
                        between me and freedom after bein'
                        here three years... And I'm not
                        gonna do anything to screw it up,
                        includin' pee in the prison yard,
                        knock up the Warden's daughter or
                        rat on my old partners...

              Cates swings the cell door back open.

                                  CATES
                        Too bad, Reggie.  I thought maybe
                        you were a smart boy.  But I guess
                        if you were real smart you
                        wouldn't be a convict.

              He smiles, decides to play his card.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        I can see a second-rater like you
                        wouldn't be any help at all goin'
                        up against a real hard case like
                        Ganz.

              Hammond jerks his head around.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Ganz?

              Pause.







                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Ganz the one who shot Henry?
                        Cates, I asked you a question...

              Cates smiles.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, I noticed...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be
                        there two years after I'm on the
                        street.

                                  CATES
                        Didn't work out that way.  He
                        busted out with a big Indian.
                        They capped two guards on a road
                        gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.

              He turns, goes out. The door clangs behind him. Hammond jumps
              up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates' back...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Cates, Come back here.

              Cates turns, saunters back, leans against the door.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta
                        get me outta here first.

                                  CATES
                        You're crazy.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I can help you, man, but you gotta
                        get me out.  I got to be on the
                        street.  Get me outta here.

                                  CATES
                        What's the big deal about you
                        bein' on the street?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I got a lot to protect.

                                  CATES
                        Bullshit.

                                  HAMMOND
                        It's the only way you're gonna get
                        Ganz.





                                  CATES
                        I'll think about it.

              TRANSITION.

              Cates typing several of official looking documents while
              seated across from a rather dour-looking bureaucrat named BOB.

                                  CATES
                        Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

              Handed over by Bob.

                                  BOB
                        You going to use your own name?

                                  CATES
                        Shit, no.

                                  CANDY

              He begins signing the documents.

                                  BOB
                        Jack, just remember one thing. If
                        all this comes down, you don't
                        know me.  I'm not gonna burn for
                        you.  And I'll tell you something
                        else.  If it all comes down, your
                        ass is new-mown grass.

                                  CATES
                        Right.  Hey, no sweat.

              He hands over the papers. Smiles.

                                  BOB
                        BOB You got him for 48 hours.

              Bob studies the sheet.

                                  BOB
                               (continuing)
                        You got a big career as a forger
                        if you decide to go that way,
                        Jack...   I'll ring security.

              TRANSITION.

              PROCESS ROOM - PRISON - DAY

              The GUARD leads Hammond to a steel cage. Harmnond's now
              wearing a beautifully tailored plaid suit.

              The Guard shouts to ANOTHER GUARD on the far side.







                                  GUARD
                        Prisoner G21355 ... Hammond.

                                  SECOND GUARD
                        Okay.  Send him through.

              The gate slides open. The Guard geztures for Hairmond to
              enter. Hammond walks to the far side of the pen.  The first
              gate closes, the second one opens.

              Hammond turns and walks over to Cates. The Guard comes up to
              Cates, double checks his orders then unlocks Hammond's cuffs.

                                  GUARD
                        Gotta sign for him.

                                  CATES
                        Sure thing...

              He looks over at Hammond who smiles at him.  Then looks at
              Harmond's clothes...

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        This prison gives out $400 suits?

                                  HAMMOND
                        What are you talkin' about?  This
                        suit's mine.  It cost $900.

              Hammond dusts off a sleeve.

                                  CATES
                        We're supposed to be after a
                        killer, not a string of hookers...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Listen, it may be a little out of
                        date. You know, I got a reputation
                        for lookingreal sharp with the
                        ladies...

              Cates hands some papers to the Guard.

                                  GUARD
                        He's all yours.

              The Guard walks away as Hammond feels Cates' lapel.

                                  HAMMOND
                        We could change this for something
                        good...Get you lookin' sharp for
                        pussy.

              Cates gives him a look.







                                  CATES
                        I don't need to hear your jive. I
                        already got that department taken
                        care of...

                                  HAMMOND
                        You got a girl... shit... the
                        generosityof women never ceases to
                        amaze me.

              Cates slaps a cuff on Hammond's outstrethand, then puts the
              other on his own wrist.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, no way.  Take off the
                        bracelets or no deal.

                                  CATES
                        You just don't get it, do your
                        Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I
                        own your ass.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No way to start a partnership.

                                  CATES
                        Get this.  We ain't partners. We
                        ain't brothers.  We ain't friends.
                        I'm puttin' you down and keepin'
                        you down until Ganz is locked up
                        or dead.  And if Ganz gets away,
                        you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Shit.  I'm already sorry.

              Cates yanks on the cuffs.  They move away.

                                  ?
                        TRANSITION.

              OUTSIDE THE JAIL - DAY



              CATES LEADS HAMMOND OUT.  THEY HEAD FOR CATES' BATTERED
              CADILLAC.

                                  HAMMOND
                        This your car, man?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.








                                  HAMMOND
                        It looks like you bought it off
                        one of the brothers.

              As they approach the car...

                                  CATES
                        Okay, let's get down to it.  I did
                        my part and got you out.  So now
                        you tell me where we're goin'?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Don't worry, I got a move for ya.
                        An awesome move. A guy named
                        Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a
                        visit.  We go to him right away.

                                  CATES
                        Luther was part of the gang?

                                  HAMMOND
                        What gang you talkin' about, Jack?

                                  CATES
                        I can read a police file,
                        shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Just an expression man, don't mean
                        nothin'.

              Cates gets behind the wheel and kicks the engine over.

                                  CATES
                        I don't give a damn.  It happens
                        to be my name.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Then what're you complainin'
                        about? At least nobody's calling
                        you shithead....

                                  CATES
                        I may call you worse than that.

              Cates drives off.

              EXT. STREET - MISSION DISTRICT - DAY

              Cates' Cadillac purrs into view, entering a deserted street
              within a rundown neighborhood.

              INT. CADDY

              Hammond seated next to Cates.







                                  HAMMOND
                        Just up the street, the other
                        side, over there ... Now, don't
                        bother knockin' on the door.
                        Luther ain't the kind of guy that
                        looks for company.

                                  CATES
                        Your pal nuts enough to take a
                        shot at me?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Luther ain't the reliable type. I
                        don't want you shot yet, Cates ...
                        not before you been a help to me.

                                  CATES
                        I'm helpin' you, huh?

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah. Didn't you know that?

              STREET

              The Caddy pulls to a stop.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Over there...232...

              Cates double-checks his .38.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        You better let me borrow one of
                        those.

              Cates smiles.

                                  CATES
                        Sure thing, asshole.

              Handcuffs Hammond to the door handle.  Grabs the car keys.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You just hang on.  And hope this
                        big move of yours turns out to be
                        something. Opens the car door.



                                  CATES
                               (continuing)







              LUTHER'S VICTORIAN

              Cates knocks at the door. Nothing. Knocks again ... no
              response.. From inside, he hears a faint noise but no
              response to the knock. Holding the .38 in one hand, Cates
              tries the knob with the other. The door opens. Cautiously,
              Cates steps inside.

              INT. LUTHER'S VICTORIAN

              Long corridor ahead. No sign of Luther.

              CATES

              Moves down the corriaor, checks the rooms off to one sides.

              LUTHER LUTHER

              slips into the hallway behind Cates... Cates turns just as he
              gets to the kitchen. Luther holds a gun. Cates drops to a
              crouch and aims the .38. Luther whirls and fires at Cates. As
              wood and plaster fly out all round him, Cates makes a running
              dive for the floor. Luther runs out before Cates has
              regainehis feet.

              STREET

              Luther rushes out the front door and heads toward the
              Cadillac.

              HAMMOND

              Watches as Luther heads down the sidewaltoward him. As he
              starts to pass by... Hammond steps out suddenly... Flattens
              him with the car door. Luther drops, stunned. Hammond, still
              restricted by being cuffed to the door handle, reaches and
              grabs his pistol.

                                  CATES
                        Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun.

              Hammond looks up. He sprints across the pavement. Aims his
              gun at Hammond.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Quit playin' cop and undo this
                        cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this
                        man.

                                  CATES
                        I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam
                        gun.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I got a whole thing about people
                        pointin' guns at me.






                                  CATES
                        Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

              Long moment. Then Hammond smiles and tosses him Luther's
              pistol.  Luther groans. Cates puts his foot on Luther's belly
              and pulls himself into a standing position, cuffs him.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Luther, I always told you the
                        physical side of life wasn't your
                        gig.  Look at you, all messed
                        up... Course you never were much
                        in the snappy dresser department,
                        were you?

              Cates now has Luther ready to be questioned.

                                  CATES
                        Come on, talk to him.

              Hammond turns to smile at Luther.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What's happening, Luther?

                                  LUTHER
                        I thought you were inside...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Meet my travel Agent.

              Luther leans forward, looks straight at Cates.

                                  LUTHER
                        A cop...

                                  CATES
                        I sure ain't his fairy
                        godmother... now I'm looking for
                        Ganz...where is he?

                                  LUTHER
                        Haven't seen him for years. That's
                        the truth.

                                  CATES
                        You just took a shot at me,
                        asshole. I think you do know where
                        he is.

                                  LUTHER
                        Who gives a fuck what you think?

              Cates grabs the still open Cadillac door, slams it into
              Luther. He falls backwards. Cates looks at Hammond.







                                  CATES
                        Hey, this works pretty good.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Thank you.

                                  CATES
                        Want to try it again?

              Luther sits up again, glares at Cates.

                                  LUTHER
                        Ganz and Billy got my girl,
                        Rosalie.

                                  CATES
                        I think I met her.  Now tell us
                        something we don't know, like
                        where they stashed her.

                                  LUTHER
                        I don't know.

              Cates slams the car door agains him again.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I gotta tell you he's having a
                        ball with this car door, Luther...
                        You'd better think of somethin' to
                        tell him.

              Luther besitates...flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him
              a silent fleeting reply.  Maybe Cates sees this. Maybe not.

                                  LUTHER
                        He ... he wants me to help him
                        skip town.

                                  CATES
                        When? How?

                                  LUTHER
                        I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

              Another look at Hammond.

                                  LUTHER
                               (continuing)
                        He's gonna call me on...Tuesday.

              Something's wrong with all this.  Cates isn't sure just what.
              Not yet. He looks at Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        What do you think?







                                  HAMMOND
                        I think you better put him on ice,
                        man.

                                  CATES
                        He's gotta take that call ... if
                        there is one.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If you let him run around till
                        Tuesday, he's gonna run right to
                        Ganz and warn him. Ain't you,
                        motherfucker?

              Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn't even
              flinch.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Luther, are you angry with me?

              Cates wrestles Luther into the back seat, turns to Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        I don't know what the hell you're
                        smiling about, watermelon. Your
                        big move turned out to be shit.

              HAMMOND Just stares at Cates, keeps smiling...

              TRANSITION.

              BOOKING - POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT

              Two Uniforms follow a sullen Luther, Cates and Hammond to the
              DUTY SERGEANT... Cates speaks to him through the small

                        I'll think up a few more and file
                        the report tomorrow.

              Cates looks back at Hammond as Luther is hauled away.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, I gotta make a phone call.

                        You stay with me.

              Cates picks up the phone on the other side of the booking
              desk. Dials ... waits for a response as TWO HOOKERS are led
              past by an Arresting Officer. Hammond gives them the eye.

              ELAINE'S APARTMENT

              Elaine is on the kitchen phone, speakingwhite putting her
              coat on over her uniform for the evening.  One look at the
              way it is cut and you know why she hates her job.

                                  ELAINE
                        Just one.  Some lady called.  Said
                        she's a little hot-headed
                        sometimes... But she still wants
                        her occasional roommate. She'd
                        like to talk it over after she
                        gets off work tonight... if it's
                        humanly possible....

                                  CATES
                        Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of
                        sone stuff right now... I'm not
                        gonna have time to come by. I
                        don't know when I can get there.

              Her face falls. Making the offer was hard enough.

                                  ELAINE
                        Come on, Jack ... you're making me
                        work too Goddamn hard at this...

              Jack is very irritated by this turn of events.

                                  CATES
                        Listen, Goddamn it if you think
                        I'm happy about it, you're nuts.
                        I just gotta take care of a few
                        things, okay?

                                  ELAINE
                        This is not the way people who
                        care for each other are supposed
                        to behave.

              Cates says nothing.  She hangs up angrily.







              BOOKING

              Hammond is working on the girls.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Excuse me, ladies, you seem to be
                        in need of assistance.

                        don't need no tight-ass court-
                        appointed lawyer trying to
                        bullshit us!

                                  HAMMOND
                        Sweetheart, I'm not trying to
                        bullshit you. I don't know whether
                        or not you ladies heard but the
                        city is coming down real hard on
                        people practicing unlawful carnal
                        knowledge.

                                  HOOKER ONE
                        So what are you trying to say,
                        fella?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm trying to say that you're not
                        just walk in that courtroom and
                        get gonna slapped with a $50 fine
                        and be back on the street turning
                        tricks tonight. You both are going
                        to do some time. About 30 days
                        each... Unless, of course,we talk
                        real business.

                                  HOOKER TWO
                        So where do you want to do it,
                        honey? You wanna hop up on the
                        counter?

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, we can go to the back room.

              Cates walks over and pulls him by the shoulder.

                                  CATES
                        We're on the move. Let's go. As
                        they walk toward a corridor.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Do you know how close I was to
                        getting some trim.  And you
                        fucked' it up.








                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you.
                        And I didn't get you out so you
                        could go on a Goddamn "trim"
                        hunt... stop moaning.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Speakin' of moans my Stomach is
                        startin' to growl.

                                  CATES
                        We eat when I say we eat.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till
                        I get something to eat. You've
                        been treating me like shit ever
                        since I came out here.  If you
                        don't like it, you can take me
                        back to the penitentiary and kiss
                        my hungry black ass good-bye.  And
                        I want some food some place nice..
                        Some good people, nice music...

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a
                        place. Let's go eat.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers...
                        They move off down the corridor.

              TRANSITION.

              UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

              INT.  POLICE HEADQUARTERS

              Cates and Hammond at a candy machine.  Cates drops in a
              quarter, throws Hammond a candy bar...

                                  CATES
                        There's your God-damn dinner. Now,
                        let's go.

              They move toward a row of parked cars.

              AT THE CADDY

                                  HAMMOND
                        Who'd you call on the phone back
                        at the booking station?

                                  CATES
                        Just get in the car and keep your
                        mouth shut.






              Hammond gets in the car as Cates readjusts Elaine's scarf on
              the mirror.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Must of been your lady friend...

              Cates frowns at him.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        You really do have onoe, huh,
                        Jack... what's her problem besides
                        you?

                                  CATES
                        She's got the same complaint as
                        half the Goddamn population.  She
                        can't get the job she's trained
                        for and it pisses her off...
                        Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

              Cates climbs in behind the wheel of the Cadillac.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, man, tell me about her.  In
                        jail they got me surrounded by
                        guys wearin' blue suits twenty-
                        four hours a day.  And I ain't
                        built for that. Really?  With the
                        clothes you got on you look like
                        you'd love it.

              Cates takes a belt from his flask.

                                  CATES
                        Now, where we goin', convict?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Mission District.  Gonna find us
                        an Indian.

              Cates starts the motor, slams it into gear.  Accelerates out
              to the street.

              TRANSITION.

              EXT.  CITY STREET NIGHT

              Cates and Hammon booming along in the Caddy.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Come on, Jack.  I want to hear
                        about your girl.  When were you
                        with her last ... You get what I
                        mean?

              Smiles. Cates smiles back at him, almost cruelly





                                  CATES
                        I don't give out the details.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Last night, two nights ago, three?

              Cates keeps smiling.

                                  CATES
                        Last night.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You have a good time?

              Pained expression on Cates' face as he comes back to reality.

                                  CATES
                        Sure.  Then we had a fight this
                        morning.

                                  HAMMOND
                        At least you took care of business
                        and got the important part in
                        before she came down on you...Tell
                        me a little about her.  She got
                        great tits?

              Cates gives him a hard look.

                                  CATES
                        I get the feeling it's going to be
                        real long night.

              They keep driving.

              TRANSITION.

              MISSION DISTRICT - STREET - NIGHT

              The Cadillac drives slowly past a bar called Torchie's.
              Stops at the end of the block.

                                  CATES
                        Well?

                                  HAMMOND
                        It's a long shot, but...Billy used
                        to tend bar here a few years back.
                        I heard him talk about it.

                                  CATES
                        This part of town, they'll make us
                        for heat the second we walk in.
                        Just back me up like you've got a
                        piece...







                                  HAMMOND
                        Back you up?  Now why would I
                        wanna do that?

                                  CATES
                        If they kick my ass, they'll sure
                        as hell carve yours up...

                                  HAMMOND
                        But you can handle it all right,
                        huh? Real amazin' how far a gun
                        and a badge can carry some cats...

                                  CATES
                        Bullshit.  Attitude and experience
                        get you through...

              Cates and Hammond step out, glance toward the bar.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I been in a lot of bars where a
                        white cop rousted me and some of
                        the brothers. All those clowns
                        ever had going for 'em was a gun
                        and a badge...

                                  CATES
                        You need five years training to
                        handle a joint like...

              Hamnond's had enough of this debate.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, you wanna bet?

                                  CATES
                        I got two problems.  Number one,
                        I'm not playin' games.  Number
                        two, you got nothin' to bet with.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If we come outta this joint with
                        Ganz' phone number, or a dead
                        Indian, or anything else useful,
                        then you could turn the other way
                        for half an hour while I get
                        laid...

                                  CATES
                        Why?  Anybody that talks about
                        women as much as you do probably
                        can't get it up anyway.

                                  HAMMOND
                        That's never been one of my
                        problems.







                        Now, stop stallin', man, or else
                        admit all this professional stuff
                        you're talkin' about is a crock of
                        shit.

                                  CATES
                        I'll tell you what happens if you
                        lose... you tell the truth for
                        once.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What are you talkin' about?

                                  CATES
                        You tell me what Ganz busted out
                        for, he's after a lot more than
                        just gettin' out of jail.  And
                        whatever it is, you're part of it.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about. I just wanna see Ganz
                        nailed.

                                  CATES
                        The bet's off.

              Hammond thinks it over..

                                  HAMMOND
                        Okay, if I lose, I'll tell you
                        anything you want to know...

              Cates reaches into his pocket.

                                  CATES
                        I'm gonna enjoy this ... here,
                        I'll even loan you my badge.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I thought you said bullshit and
                        experience are all it takes.

              He takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance.

              TORCHIE'S WESTERN BAR

              They step inside. Hammond reacts to...

              REDNECK CITY

              Longhorns mounted over the bar, Rebel Flags, Lone Star Beer,
              armadillo posters. Even the waitresses wear Stetsons.
              Rockabilly pounding from the jukebox. A Cowgirl Stripper is
              doing the grind on a small podium.






                                  HAMMOND
                        This place don't seem real popular
                        with the brothers.

                                  CATES
                        My kind of place. I always liked
                        country boys.

              Cates smiles, finds a table in the corner. A Cowgirl comes
              over to take his order.

              HAMMOND

              Takes a deep breath, moves toward the bar. Smiles at the good
              ol' boys. They don't smile back. He sits down at the bar.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Yeah.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Vodka.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Maybe you better have a Black
                        Russian.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

              Hamnond looks around the room.

              THE BARTENDER

              places a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as
              Harmond flashes Cates' shield.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You know a big Indian named Billy
                        Bear?  He used to work here.

              The Bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Never heard of him.

              Hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror
              behind the bar. Sudden silence throughout the room.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Now how's your memory doin'?



                                  BARTENDER
                        Fuck off.  I don't know what the
                        hell you're talkin' about.






                                  HAMMOND
                        Maybe I better ask around, see
                        what your pals think.

                                  BARTENDER
                        I don't give a shit who you ask.

              The Bartender walks down toward Cates.

              HAMMOND

              Moves away from the bar. He stops at a booth occupied by

              FOUR COWBOY PUNKS,

              one a very big man.  Hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls
              him up.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Up against the wall, cowboy.

              The Punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at Hammond.
              Gets a right to the stomach for his trouble.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Now, I said get over there by that
                        wall ... You hear me,
                        motherfucker...

              Looks at the others.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Move it, rednecks.  On your feet...

              He grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Over there...move your ass. Some
                        of you rednecks seem a little hard
                        of hearing, so I'll repeat it for
                        everybody... I need word on the
                        whereabouts of an Indian that goes
                        by the name of Billy Bear. It's a
                        police matter and you all look
                        like you'd just love to
                        cooperate...

              CATES Quietly sips his beer. The other occupants of the bar
              watch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall.

              A BIG COWBOY

              when Hammond isn't looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates
              puts out a leg. Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable.





              HAMMOND

              Turns around at the noise.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        That wasn't necessary, buddy. I
                        got this under control.

                                  CATES
                        Some of us citizens are with you
                        all the way, Officer.

              The Redneck Punks are now spread-eagled against the wall.
              Hammond searches the first. He drops a wallet on the floor
              and moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and
              another wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a
              roll of bills.  Hammond holds the money up to his face.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You're in trouble, big trouble, so
                        you better start talking. Where'd
                        a boy like you make a score like
                        this?

                                  PUNK
                        It's mine, what the hell...

                                  HAMMOND
                        You must a rolled somebody.  They
                        don't let punks like you take jobs
                        that pay this much ... you sure
                        you don't know a dangerous Indian,
                        because unless you start talkin'
                        I may just have to start looking
                        down your pants with a
                        flashlight...

                                  PUNK
                        What kind of cop are you, anyway?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I am your most terrible nightmare
                        ... a bad nigger with a badge that
                        entitles him to kick your ass...

              Hammond turns to the Bartender...

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        One of them is under-age.  Another
                        attacked a police officer. And you
                        know I ain't found what I came
                        lookin' here for yet...

              Walks back to the Bartender.






                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        The tall one had a weapon ... you
                        want me to keep on makin' a list,
                        or you got the picture yet?

              He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks
              the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as
              the glasses break into a million fragments.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Looks like you're on your way to
                        bein' outta business, redneck...
                        Now, let's see what can we fuck
                        with next?

              The Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Okay, okay.  The Indian hangs out
                        with a girl down the block. Right
                        where Chinatown starts.  She lives
                        on top of the hardware store.

              Hammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he's concerned, he's
              won the bet.  Cates nods, slips out the door.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I don't give a damn about his
                        girl...

                                  BARTENDER
                        Look, give me a break, you're
                        going to have to settle for her
                        place.  It's the only thing I know.

              He looks desperate.

                                  BARTENDER
                               (continuing)
                        I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all
                        I know.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Try obeyin' the law once in
                        awhile, and I won't have to hassle
                        you...

              Turns to go, then turns back.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        But remember this, cowboy, there's
                        a new sheriff in town.

              Smiles, turns and goes.





              TRANSITION.

              STREET - ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT

              Hammond steps out of the bar.  He crosses to Cates by the car.

                                  CATES
                        I think you got something for me.

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        The gun you took off that redneck
                        in there.

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You made that move, huh?

                                  CATES
                        While you're at it, You can give
                        me the switchblade, too.

              Hammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down
              on the hood of the car.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Credit cards?

              Hammond hands them over with the knife.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You already got a gun and you owe
                        me a piece of ass.  I'll settle
                        for the gun you just took.

              A long moment. Then Cates slowly lifts the .22 automatic.

                                  CATES
                        You did a real good job... Guess
                        you deserve a reward.

              Removes the clip.  Throws it across the street. Hands Hammond
              the automatic.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Motherfucker.

              He throws the gun away.

                                  CATES
                        I sure am. Now let's go get us an
                        Indian.






              They walk up the block.

              TRANSITION.

              STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

              Neon signs with Sino lettering.

              CATES AND HAMMOND

              Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of
              tools.  Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk
              to the end of the block.

              ALLEY

              Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and
              Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the
              hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.

              STAIRWELL

              The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.
              Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent
              window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from
              a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently
              exercising women.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What the shit is that?

              Looks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room.

                                  CATES
                        There.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Must be billy's girl.

                                  CATES
                        Come on.

              DOORWAY

              Cates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for
              several moments. The door swings open. They step into a
              darkened room.

              APARTMENT

              Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open
              bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step
              quickly into the room.

                                  CATES
                        Police! Nobody move!






              Hammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow.
              Slumps against the door. A Woman's voice screams out.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Stay where you are!

              The light goes on. Cates' gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY)
              in a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held
              between her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY)
              stands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and
              slightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt. Holds
              a baseball bat in her right hand.

                                  SALLY
                        You better drop it or he's gonna
                        get another one.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, talk to here jack.  I don't
                        feel like gettin' number two along
                        side of the head.

                                  CATES
                        I said police.  Now drop the
                        goddamn gun.

                                  CASEY
                        Don't give me that police shit.
                        You drop it.

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                        Okay, look, don't shoot.  I'm just
                        reachin' for my badge.

              Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey.

                                  CASEY
                        I don't like this bullshit. I've
                        seen fake badges before.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'll tell you something lady, this
                        guy is a real nervous cop - He's
                        just liable to pull the trigger.

              Cates takes two steps toward Casey...

                                  CATES
                        Naw, I'm the calm type.  I know
                        you don't want me to shoot you,
                        and I know that you don't want to
                        shoot me.

              He takes two more steps toward her.





                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Shooting a cop puts you away for
                        a long time.

              Holds out his hand.

                                  CASEY
                        You assholes better be real.

              She hands Cates the gun. Sally prods Hammond with the
              baseball bat.

                                  SALLY
                        Just wait a Goddamn second here,
                        let's see your badge...

              He snatches the bat out of her hands.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Don't have one.

                                  SALLY
                        I knew it.  Call the cops.

              Casey walks over to the phone.

                                  CATES
                        Tell them it's Cates, Detective
                        31st District.  Then put your
                        clothes on. If you don't answer
                        some questions I'm taking both
                        your asses in.

              After a moment, Casey puts down the phone.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Now, let's cut out the crap, which
                        one of you sees Billy Bear?

                                  SALLY
                        None of your business, cop.  The
                        son of a bitch isn't here, and he
                        isn't coming back.

                                  CATES
                        You can do better than that.

              Turns to Casey.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        How about it?








                                  CASEY
                        I used to go with him...I don't
                        know where the hell he is.  I
                        haven't seen him for two weeks.
                        And I don't think I will.  He owes
                        me money...

                                  SALLY
                        He's a Goddamn lowlife, the way he
                        treated her.

                                  CATES
                        Sounds like a real stormy romance.

                                  CASEY
                        I don't much care what it sounds
                        like to you, Cop. All I know is
                        that I went a few laps around the
                        track with him and I ended up with
                        nothin' but the short end of the
                        stick.

              Cates looks over at Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        Let's go.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies
                        would like to go a few laps with
                        us.  How about it? I been nearly
                        three years in prison and...

                                  SALLY
                        Fuck off.

                                  CATES
                        Come on...

              Hannond starts for the door with Cates.

                                  CASEY
                        If you find that bastard, Billy,
                        tell him to stay out of my life.
                        I don't need any more of his macho
                        bullshit.

              TRANSITION.

              STREET  CHINATOWN - NIGHT

              The two men walk among the bright neon lights. Neither of
              them very happy.









                                  CATES
                        This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of
                        my gun and goes all over the
                        streets killing people with it.
                        So, instead of me being where I
                        oughta be, which is in bed giving
                        my girl the high, hard one, I'm
                        out here doing this shit, roaming
                        around with some overdressed,
                        charcoal-colored loser like you.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You wanna leave, man?  Let me take
                        care of Ganz all by myself.

                                  CATES
                        You?  Don't make me laugh.  You
                        can't take care of shit.  You've
                        been dicking me around since we
                        started on this turd-hunt.  All
                        you're good for is games... So
                        far, what I got outta you is
                        nothin'...

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm impressed with you too, Jack
                        you did a real good job of busting
                        up a couple of dykes bedded down
                        for the night.

                                  CATES
                        Luther knew more than he told me
                        and so do you...Now you better
                        tell we what the fuck this is all
                        about.  I gave you 48 hours to
                        come up with something and the
                        clock's runnin' ...

              A long look at Hammond.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Maybe I don't like the way you ask.

                                  CATES
                        Who gives a Goddamn what you
                        think? You're just a crook that's
                        got a weekendpass ... You're not
                        even a name anymore. Just a spear-
                        chucker with a Goddamn number
                        stenciled on the back of his
                        prison fatigues...

              They walk past.

              TRANSITION.







              STREET ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT

              They two men walk toward the Cadillac.

                                  CATES
                        Okay, Reggie, I'm done playing
                        around. I want to know what's
                        going on and I'm going to beat the
                        living shit out of you until you
                        tell me.

              Hammond goes into a street rap.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You beat the shit out of me?
                        Don't make me laugh, sucker.  You
                        don't know how I'd dance on your
                        face?  I'll hit you so hard, so
                        many times, you'll wish you'd
                        never been hatched.  I'll turn
                        your face into cottage cheese.
                        I'll make your girl think you been
                        takin' ugly pills.  She won't even
                        know who you are, sucker.

              They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the
              hood.  Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his
              wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the
              car fender... Smiles.

                                  CATES
                        I guess the first thing I ought,
                        to explain to you, nigger, is I
                        fight dirty.

              Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.
              Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates
              hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially
              open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.

                                  HAMMOND
                        So do I.

              Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head.  Cates blocks it with
              crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away
              from Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each
              other.

              Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,
              a bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.

              Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more
              labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates
              clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater
              bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a
              brick wall.






              Hammond is faster...

              Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at
              one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's
              back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the
              lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...
              Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at
              his side... Breath coming like a bellows...

              Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put
              him out.

                                  CATES
                        Now, you bastard, you going to
                        tell me what's going on...

              Puffing away.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        ... Do I have to kick the shit out
                        of you some more.

              They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-
              white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights
              flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,
              guns drawn.

                                  FIRST COP
                        All right, you two.  Don't move.

                                  CATES
                        NO, no...it's okay...I'm police.

                                  SECOND COP
                        Yeah, sure.  Get your hands above
                        your head.

              He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        My gun and badge are over there.
                        And I'm too fucking tired to raise
                        my hands...

              Hammond rubs the side of his face. Cates falls back against
              the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop
              lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,
              shows it to the other cop.

                                  FIRST COP
                        What the hell's going on here?

              Cates walks over, pockets his gun.








                                  SECOND COP
                        I've got a burglary call.  Two
                        women say a couple of hoods broke
                        into their place posing as cops.

                                  CATES
                        I was following a lead.  We
                        rousted them... Go up and sweet
                        talk 'em.  You can straighten it
                        out.

              The First Cop checks out Cates' badge and I.D.

                                  FIRST COP
                        Why don't you do it?  We got
                        better things to do than
                        straighten out your messes.

                                  CATES
                        So do I. I'll file a report
                        tomorrow.

              The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing.  He's
              pissed.

                                  FIRST COP
                        I gotta file a..Report tonight
                        asshole...

                                  CATES
                        Goes with the territory.

              He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac.

              TRANSITION.

              ALL-NIGHT GAS STATION

              Cadillac parked behind the service area.

              RESTROOM

              Hammond looks' up at his bruised face in the mirror, then
              washes up.  Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a
              piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Too bad we got interrupted when we
                        did.  I was getting ready to
                        finish you off.

              Cates straightens up from the wash basin.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, right.  You want to try
                        again?






                                  HAMMOND
                        Naw, you'd just call your pals
                        back to bail you out one more time.

                                  CATES
                        They saved your ass, convict.

                                  HAMMOND
                        One thing's for sure, Jack.
                        That's how you'll tell the story.

              Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom.

                                  CATES
                        I'll even put it in my report that
                        way.

              The door closes behind Cates. Hammond leans back toward the
              mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Motherfucker.

              GAS STATION PARKING LOT

              Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges. Hammond
              starts for the passenger side.

                                  CATES
                        Wait a minute.

              Hammond stops.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You come clean or we're going to
                        go again.  Right here, right now.

              Pause.

              A long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I been waiting a long time for
                        some money.

                                  CATES
                        How much?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Half a million.

                                  CATES
                        Jesus.

              Hammond smiles his meanest smile.






                                  HAMMOND
                        How's that for a number to give
                        you heart failure? Guess you might
                        start to get the picture after
                        all. Mlaybe you're on the wrong
                        side of the old law and order
                        business..

              Cates is unmoved.

                                  CATES
                        Just tell me about the money.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Me and my bunch hit a dealer in
                        the middle of a sale. It's the
                        kind of money nobody ever reports
                        stolen. I was sittin' pretty,
                        livin' in the high cotton, then
                        somebody fingered me for another
                        job. ... Some psycho who's out
                        there capping people with some
                        cop's gun.

                                  CATES
                        He's after your money.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You catch on real fast...Okay,
                        Jack, let's talk deal. How much of
                        my money you gonna let me keep?

              Cates just looks at him.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        We split 50-50?

                                  CATES
                        Not likely, convict.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You gonna let me keep any of it?

                                  CATES
                        Depends on how things work out. I
                        believe in the merit system. So
                        far you haven't built up any
                        points.

              He smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Okay, from now on, I'm gonna be
                        real good, Jack.

              Cates smiles back.





                                  CATES
                        Where's the money?

                                  HAMMOND
                        In the trunk of a car.  A lot
                        better than under a mattress,
                        right?

              Cates smiles.

                                  CATES
                        Right, partner.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Get this. We ain't partners. We
                        ain't brothers. We ain't friends.
                        If Ganz gets away with my money,
                        you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.  Right.

              They get into the Caddy. Boom away.

              TRANSITION.

              The Cadillac moving through the city... Clock on the
              dashboard showing 4 a.m. Cates at the wheel.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Where's the goddamn car?

                                  HAMMOND
                        You're a real case, you know that,
                        Jack?

              Smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        This'll show you how smart I am.
                        I got it parked.

                                  CATES
                        ...For three years?  Let's hope it
                        wasn't a tow-away zone.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You just drove by it.

              The Cadillac makes a screeching U-turn,i swings into the curb.

              Cates leans out, looks at...








              PARKING BUILDING

              Narrow, multi-storied, with a garage-like opening and
              signals... proclaiming 'Weekly-Monthly-Long Term."

              CADILLAC

                                  CATES
                        Okay, now what?

              Hammond gets out of the car.

              Stands on the sidewalk.

              Stretches.

              Then gets into the back seats.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Since you're wired on benniest you
                        get to stay up and stare at the
                        building. I'm  tired, so I'm going
                        to sleep. They take Sunday off.
                        Place opens at seven o'clock
                        Monday morning. Wake me up at a
                        quarter till...

              Cates stares at the place.

                                  CATES
                        You son of a bitch. You knew where
                        the money was all along and all we
                        had to do was come here and wait.
                        I almost got my ass blown off
                        twice tonight for nothing.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I wasn't sure the money was still
                        there until we saw Luther. You
                        almost got your ass shot off for
                        nothing once, not twice, Jack.

                                  CATES
                        Shit.

              THE CITY

              Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky.

              TRANSITION.

              The Cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block
              from the parking sections Cates walks in through the lot
              entrance. Threads his way between the lines of parked
              vehicles Tired and haggard, he carries a paper bag filled
              with quick-order food.






              CADILLAC

              Hammond stretches on the back seat.  Cates slams the door
              shut.

                                  CATES
                        I don't want you sleeping on the
                        job.

              Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position.

                                  HAMMOND
                        The place opens in five minutes.
                        Ganz ought to be here soon...

              Cates tears the paper bag open. Passes a cup of coffee and
              donut back. He sips his own coffee, adds some whiskey from
              his flask... pops another bennie.

                                  CATES
                        You took a big chance, leaving
                        this here all this time.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Not really.  I figured Ganz was
                        put down for a long time.  And I
                        knew Luther would never job me on
                        his own.  He's too chickenshit.

                                  CATES
                        Guess what?  Luther just got in
                        line.

              Hammond sits up.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What?

                                  CATES
                        Musta got some primo bondsman.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace
                        The guy pulls a gun on a cop and
                        he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you
                        some of the courts these days are
                        just a fucking revolving door.

              INT. PARKING LOT BUILDING

              Luther walks up to the window where a bored ATTENDANT reads
              a comic book.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        Yeah?







                                  LUTHER
                        I want to pick up my car.

              He passes across a faded form.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        Name?

                                  LUTHER
                        Hammond.

              The Attendant examines the form, surprised.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        This is three years old.

                                  LUTHER
                        Yeah, I've been busy.

              The Attendant opens a key file, begins rummaging in it.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        We don't wash 'em, ya know.

                                  LUTHER
                        How about chargin' the battery?

                                  ATTENDANT
                        That we do. And we put air in the
                        tires. I'll even sell you some gas
                        if you need it.

                                  LUTHER
                        Great, just great.

              The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth. Luther follows
              to an elevated stack of cars. The Attendant throws a switch,
              the stack of cars begins to move.

              STREET

              Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche
              convertible.

              The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for
              the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean.

              Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out.

              Another street

              Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's
              Cadillac appears ... starts to tail the Porsche.

              CADILLAC

              Cates follows Luther through several turns.





              The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Jesus Christ, look at all the dust
                        on my car...why in the hell don't
                        he take it to a car wash?

                                  CATES
                        Didn't know you darker people went
                        in for foreign jobs.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I had no choice. Some white

                        I let women get to me.  The quest
                        for pussy is the meaning of life
                        ... I got my own personal

                        business ... women are for

              driveway of parking lot.

              LUTHER - CATES & HAMMOND'S P.O.V.

              He goes to the trunk. Rummages there ... picks up a flaming
              red suit.

                        That was in style a couple years

                        armed robbery to pimping, then
                        you're all set.

              Under the suit is a nondescript attache case. Luther takes
              it, closes the trunk. Beads down the sidewalk.

              They jump out of the car, follow on foot.








              STREET

              Luther hurries along the sidewalk.

              He reaches the corner, turns quickly...

              CATES AND HAMMOND

              Following a little way behind.

              They pause at the corner, watching the pedestrian traffic
              move by. Then turn down the cross street after Luther. Follow
              him down a stairwell.

              SUBWAY STATION - LOBBY

              Escalators and open stairwells. Luther enters and pauses by
              the doorway. Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near
              the stairwells. More people are seated along hard plastic
              seats. But no Ganz.  And no Billy.

              Luther moves further into the station.  Cates and Hammond
              enter. They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead.
              Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area
              and back toward the escalator. Hammond remains near the
              arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters. Luther puts
              the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter.
              Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by.  A crowd
              of people from the train area below flows through the lobby
              obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment.  Cates
              steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving
              through the crowd toward Luther. Be looks over at Hammond
              across the station and motions.  Then they both start moving
              in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper
              into the crowd.

              Ganz moves cautiously through the station. A crumpled
              newspaper held absently in his hand. He scans the faces of
              the commuters and spots Luther. Fails to notice Cates and
              Hammond closing in on him from two directions.

              A PATROLMAN comes up. Starts chatting amiably with a Boy
              Scout next to Luther. Ganz hesitates in his approach. He
              motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when
              he sees Cates and Hammond closing in...

              Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men. He makes
              an immediate break for open ground. The Patrolman sees Ganz
              start to run. The newspaper is thrown to the floor... Ganz
              swings Cates' .44 toward Hammond.

                                  PATROLMAN
                        Hey--you!

              Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor. His shot
              at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling. The crowd starts to
              panic and run in all directions.





              The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out. Levels it
              at Ganz.

                                  PATROLMAN
                               (continuing)
                        Put it down.

              BILLY BEAR

              Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side. Billy Bear's .44
              blasts the Patrolman onto his back.

              Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons.
              He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator. Cates has
              already brought out his .38... Can't get a clean shot through
              the chaos.

              Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Shoot the sons of bitches.

              Cates can't risk it...

                               (continuing)

                        give me the gun...

              A moment.

                               (continuing)
                        Bullshit. Then i'm staying with
                        the money.

                                  CATES
                        You stay with me...

                                  HAMMOND
                        No way...

              Hammond starts after Luther. Cates turns, starts to aim at
              Hammond. Hesitates...

              PASSENGER WALKWAY

              Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman
              with the gun.

              Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd,
              tugging Rosalie along...

              Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after
              Ganz.

              Ganz grabs a man beside him.





              Shoves him hard into the passengers in back.

              The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock.

              Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains.
              Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the
              terrorized passengers...

              The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard. The
              patrons huddle in fear against any available wall.

              Cates bursts out of the stairwell...

              TUNNEL

              Red and green signal lights. The light goes red, a train
              roars up and the doors hiss open.

              Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the
              train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him.

              CATES

              Running for the doors...

              Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand.

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                        Freeze!

                                  CATES
                        No! No!  There they are!

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                        Just put it down real slow.

              The train doors close.

                                  CATES
                        I'm a policeman, you asshole!

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                        Don't even try... now drop it
                        or - you're all done.

              He means it, points the riot gun even closer... The train in
              front of him moves away.

              Cates carefully places the .38 on the pavement. Then raises
              his hands in the air.

                                  CATES
                        Shit.







              TRAIN STATION - LOBBY

              Witnesses stand in nervous little knots. Give versions of
              what happened to notepad-toting patrolmen. Hospital
              Attendants minister to various and sundry complaints.

              Cates sits on a passenger bench, obviously dejected.  A
              voice comes echoing from behind.

                                  HADEN
                        Cates.

              Haden, silhouetted against the light from the street.

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        What the bell happened?

                                  CATES
                        I lost them, that's what happened.

                                  HADEN
                        How did they get away?

                                  CATES
                        They ran.  As fast as they could.
                        Caught a train.

              Haden watches the Morgue Personnel wheel out the body of the
              Patrolman.

                                  HADEN
                        Which one pulled the trigger?

                                  CATES
                        The Indian.  I was about 30 yards
                        away.

                                  HADEN
                        You couldn't get to him?

              Cates shrugs.

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        What a screw-up.

                                  CATES
                        Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked
                        up. I messed up.  Anybody could
                        have done better, especially you.
                        I bet you're real good at hitting
                        targets through crowds.

              Haden starts toward the street. Looks back at Cates.







                                  HADEN
                        Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why
                        didn't you call in for backup
                        instead of makin' a grandstand
                        play?

                                  CATES
                        I didn't have the time.

                                  HADEN
                        Too bad, it would've covered your
                        ass.  Now you're in the shit and
                        so's the department. In case you
                        haven't noticed, this wasn't our
                        finest hour... I told you everyone
                        was watchin' on this one. Maybe
                        you better start thinkin' about
                        writin' tickets off a three wheel
                        bike.

              Cates looks at Haden for a moment...

              Turns and walks away.

              TRANSITION.

              PREDMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

              Hammond across the street from Predmore.

              Standing in a phone booth talking into the receiver...

              He turns and looks acain at the hotel...

              Hangs up.

              Walks into a nearby bar.

              TRANSITION.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB

              HAMMOND

              Punk Dancers all over the floor.

              A rock group blasting away...("NEW SHOES" - Vocal)

              HAMMOND

              At a back booth...

              A MAN (SOSNA) approaches carrying a small suitcase.

                                  HAMMOND
                        How you doing, man?






                                  SOSNA
                        Not bad, not bad.

              Puts the suitcase down on the table.

                                  SOSNA
                               (continuing)
                        You want to go outside?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Naw, right here's okay.

              Dancers sliding and jerking in front of them.

                                  SOSNA
                        You sure?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm sure.  Everybody here's
                        looking at everybody else's ass.

              Sosna pops open the suitcase. Lid shielding the contents from
              the patrons...

                                  SOSNA
                        I got some real nice merchandise.
                        All of it's clean.

              Suitcase arranged like q salesman's display case. Tightly
              spaced rows of handguns mounted in their holsters.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I like this one...

              Pockets a revolver with a deft move.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        How about some ammo?

                                  SOSNA
                        It's loaded... I got some shells
                        in here.

              Opens another compartment. Hammond helps himself to two
              boxes...

                                  HAMMOND
                        How much?

                                  SOSNA
                        This is clean shit.  No serial
                        numbers and never been used...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Don't mess with me. How much?






                                  SOSNA
                        Five bills.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Five.  On credit.

                                  SOSNA
                        This ain't a credit business.

              You know that.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, I know that, but this is me
                        and we're old friends. I haven't
                        got the money so what are you
                        gonna do about it?

                                  SOSNA
                        Give it back.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Try and take it.

              A long moment.

                                  SOSNA
                        Fuck you.  You got no right for
                        this kind of play.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'll got your money to you. No
                        sweat.

              Hammonds heads for the bar.

              Stands next to a good-looking woman (RITA). Nods to the
              barkeep.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Vodka. With a twist. And I want to
                        run a tab.

              Served up. He knocks half of it back, turns to the woman.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        My name's Reggie Hammond.

              Big personality smile.

                                  RITA
                        So what?

              She turns away as he takes a drink. He looks at another
              pretty girl (ANGELA).






                                  HAMMOND
                        Hi there. I'm Reggie Hammond.

                                  ANGELA
                        I'm with somebody.

              She turns away.

                                  HAMMOND
                        This ain't my night.

              He drinks up.

              TRANSITION.

              SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

              Several Detectives are working at desks. Kehoe walks into the
              office. He moves slowly to Cates' desk and slumps down in a
              nearby chair.

                                  KEHOE
                        You look awful.

                                  CATES
                        So do you...been a long day.

                                  KEHOE
                        Long night, too, from what I heard
                        ... Word's going around that in
                        addition to losing Ganz for the
                        second time, and in addition to
                        Haden busting you back to
                        Patrolman, some jig beat the crap
                        out of you.

                                  CATES
                        Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.

                                  KEHOE
                        Doesn't look like it.

                                  CATES
                        Nothing came in for me yet?  No
                        calls?

                                  KEHOE
                        Nothing.

              Kehoe's phone begins to ring.  Cates watches hopefully.

                                  KEHOE
                               (continuing)
                        Kehoe... Okay, hang on.

              Offers the phone to Cates.






                                  KEHOE
                               (continuing)
                        It's for you... Ordinance.

              Cates' excitement vanishes. He takes the receiver. Kehoe
              begins to clean off his desk.

                                  CATES
                        Hello... Yeah, okay.  I'll be in
                        tomorrow. That's right, you can
                        depend on it.  Okay?

              He slams down the receiver, leans back in the chair.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Bullshit red tape.

                                  KEHOE
                        I'm heading out. How about you?

              Cates shakes his head.

                                  CATES
                        I got to wait for a call.

                                  KEHOE
                        Okay.  See you in the morning...
                        you know, you ought to get some
                        rest...

              He walks out the door. Cates stares fixedly at the phone on
              the desk. Hoping Hammond will call... Across the room another
              phone starts to ring. Cates stares at the PLAINCLOTHESMAN who
              answers.

                                  PLAINCLOTHESMAN
                        Yeah, he's here.

              Cates stiffens.

                                  PLAINCLOTHESMAN
                               (continuing)
                        Cates... line twelve.

              Cates snatches up the phone, shouts into it...

                                  CATES
                        You motherfucker, where are you?

              ELAINE

              In the Chronicle Restaurant and Bar, a well appointed
              establishment off Montgomery Street.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?





                                  CATES
                        Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was
                        expecting somebody else... police

                                  ELAINE
                        No wonder you're so popular.

                                  CATES
                        No, it's I'm just surprised you
                        called.

                                  ELAINE
                        So am I.

                           ELAINE                        CATES
                   Jack, this afternoon...       Hey, look, when...

                                  ELAINE
                        You first.

                                  CATES
                        Look, I'm sorry about ... the way
                        things have been lately.  I know
                        I haven't been acting real great...

              Behind Cates, Kehoe steps back into the room.

                                  KEHOE
                        Hey, Cates...

              Cates swings around.

                                  KEHOE
                               (continuing)
                        I almost forgot.  That pal of
                        yours from the Vice Squad wants
                        you to call him.

                                  CATES
                        What?

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, are you still there?

                                  KEHOE
                        Yeah.  He said he rousted a bar
                        with you last night.

                                  CATES
                        Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't
                        you tell me before?

                                  KEHOE
                        I'm not paid to take your personal
                        calls.  He was in some bar. .. off
                        duty.





              Cates interrupts.

                                  CATES
                        The number ... what's the Goddamn
                        number?

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack?  What was that?

                                  KEHOE
                        Find it yourself.  It's on my desk.

              Cates speaks back into the receiver.

                                  CATES
                        Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, wait...

                                  CATES
                        Just a second, that's all!

              He hits the bold button, starts rummaging through the desk.
              Paperwork scatters in all directions.

              Kehoe watches him in silence for awhile then leaves. Cates
              begins to dial.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Hammond... you son of a bitch,
                        where are you?

              Listens for a moment.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB

              Hammond on the phone as the band rocks away.   (MONKEY
              MASH - Track only)

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took
                        you so long to call, man? I been
                        waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in
                        the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's...
                        'Course you don't hang out here;
                        it's for the brothers.

              SQUAD ROOM

                                  CATES
                        I'll be there in a minute. You
                        don't move your ass, right?

              Slams down the phone. Starts toward the door. Remembers...






              He dashes back to the phone, hits the other line. Hears only
              a buzz.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Oh, shit.

              TRANSITION.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB

              Band blasting away on another number (THE BOYS ARE BACK IN
              TOWN - VOCAL)

              Hammond now in the middle of the floor dancing his ass off
              with a girl named CANDY. As the song ends...

                                  HAMMOND
                        My name's Reggie Hammond.

              Tries his big personality smile.

              This time gets one back.

                                  CANDY
                        I'm candy...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Excuse me, baby, but if i don't
                        get some action tonight, I'm gonna
                        bust.  You interested?

                                  CANDY
                        Hey, what kind of talk is that?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

                                  CANDY
                        No, I go to a school to learn how
                        to do hair. It's a government
                        program. But really I want to be
                        a model - and I am definitely not
                        sellin'.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (humorously)
                        Goodbye.

              She stops him.

                                  CANDY
                        Hey, don't you think a hair
                        stylists got any interest in
                        gettin' it on?







                                  HAMMOND
                        Here you go sweetheart, throw it
                        my way.

              He gives her a kiss.

                                  CANDY
                        You're in a hurry.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, i been waiting three years.

                                  CANDY
                        You just quit bein' a priest or
                        somethin'?

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, baby, nothin' like that.
                        Look, there's a place across the
                        street. We can go right over
                        there...

                                  CANDY
                        What's the matter with my place?

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, it's gotta be here and now.
                        Believe me. Only I don't have the
                        damn money for a room...

              The band starts up again. ("LOVE SONGS ARE FOR CRAZIES" -
              VOCAL)

                                  CANDY
                        Yeah, well, even us non-pros
                        expect the guy to pay for the
                        room...

              Cates suddenly appears... steps between them. Yells above the
              band's noise.

                                  CATES
                        Where's luther?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Be polite. Say hello.  This is
                        Candy.

                                  CATES
                        Hello. And goodbye.

              She looks at Hammond. He nods.

                                  CANDY
                        Well, maybe I'll see you later ...







                                  HAMMOND
                        Here's hoping, baby...

              Candy leaves and melts into the crowd on the dance floor.

                                  CATES
                        What about Luther?

                                  HAMMOND
                        What about Ganz?

              Cates shrugs.

                                  CATES
                        We missed.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You missed ... Luther took a taxi
                        to the hotel across the street.
                        Made a phone call.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe we should pay Luther a
                        visit.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Let him get some sleep.  He's
                        going to need it.

              They move to the bar.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        They must have set up a meeting
                        for the morning; Luther left an 8
                        am wake-up and put up the "Don't
                        Disturb" sign.  He's trading his
                        girl for the money.  All we have
                        to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

                                  CATES
                        So you took the rest of the night
                        off...

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        We don't have too many
                        cheerleaders in prison. I though
                        I might indulge myself in a little
                        trim.

              Cates orders two drinks.









                                  CATES
                        Tell me something.  Why didn't you
                        just take the money off Luther and
                        split?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as
                        you do and I got some other news
                        for you...

              He opens his jacket slightly. Reveals a shoulder holster and
              accompanying .45.  A long moment.

                                  CATES
                        I don't know why, but I'm going to
                        let you keep it. Maybe because you
                        told me you had it, or maybe just
                        because I'm too tired to argue...

                                  HAMMOND
                        You sure that's the reason?

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                        Thanks for callin' in... and I
                        guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I
                        called you Watermellon nigger...
                        those kinds of things. I was just
                        leanin' on ya, doin' my job.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Bein' good at your job don't
                        explain everything, Jack ...

                                  CATES
                        Yeah. Guess not.

              Hammond gives him a big smile.

                                  HAMMOND
                        As long as you're feeling like Abe
                        Lincoln, how about payin' me on
                        our bet?  We got time and all this
                        pussy around here's drivin' me
                        crazy. See that one over there,
                        the one I was with...

              He nods at Candy across the way.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, I see her.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I can just take her right across
                        the street to Luther's hotel.  All
                        I need is some money for the room.







                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)

              Big smile as Cates produces some cash. Hammond counts it
              eagerly. Looks around. Candy suddenly appears like a trout
              seeing a lure.  She grabs the money.

                                  CANDY
                        Hello, again.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I just struck it rich... I think
                        we can do a little business.  As
                        a matter of fact, I think we can
                        have a party.

              Hammond smiles, leads her out of the bar.

                                  CATES
                        Hurry back.

              Cates watches them go, downs his drink. He fishes in his
              pocket for a coin, moves to a wall phone. Dials...

              CHRONICLE RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

              A COCKTAIL WAITRESS answers the phone as Elaine pours a drink.

                                  COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        It's for you.

              Hands her the receiver.

                                  ELAINE
                        Hello.

                                  CATES
                        Hi, it's me...

                                  ELAINE
                        Fuck you.

              She slams down the receiver.

              SIDEWALK - FRONT OF VROMAN'S - NIGHT

              Hammond and Candy exit the rock club. A line of young Punkers
              waiting to get inside... Hammond and Candy are in a tight
              clinch, a little giggly.

                                  CANDY
                        So... what did you have in mind?

              Suddenly, Hammond sees Luther emerge from the Predmore across
              the street.





                                  HAMMOND
                        Oh no, not now!

              Luther moves down the street with the briefcase.  Hammond
              pulls Candy back inside Vroman's.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB - BAR

              Rock group still blasting away... (LOVE SONGS ARE FOR
              CRAZIES - Vocal continues)

              Hammond and Candy reappear, knocking aside a waitress about
              to refill Cates' drink.

                                  CATES
                        That was quick.

                                  HAMMOND
                        When you been in prison three
                        years, it don't take long. Let's
                        go.

                                  CATES
                        Why?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Luther's on the move...

              Cates jumps up, runs out. Hammond looks at Candy.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be back. Trust me.

              He kisses her.

              Runs off after Cates. She stares at him in disbelief.

              STREET LIGHT

              Luther checking over his shoulder for shadows, walks down the
              block. Turns into a narrow street.

              A BUS STOP

              Luther waits, impatient.

              Checks his watch.

              Looks up and down the street.

              He double-checks the bus stop sign over his head.

              Just as a bus pulls to a stop, air brakes hissing ...








              LUTHER

              Gets in.

              Sees that the driver is Billy Bear...

              BUS

              The bus starts up. Luther hesitates in the front. On the wide
              rear seat is Ganz. Rosalie beside him.

                                  GANZ
                        Open your coat. Both sides.

              He shows he's not packed.

                                  LUTHER
                        Let her go.

                                  GANZ
                        First, the money.

              Luther takes a step.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Just show me.

              Luther puts the case on a side seat, opens it for display.

              ANOTHER BUS STOP

              Commuters look up expectantly. One of two drift toward the
              curb. Jump back in alarm as the bus roars by.

              BUS

              Ganz is satisfied. Luther closes the case.

                                  LUTHER
                        Rosalie, you okay?

                                  GANZ
                        What are you talkin' about? I said
                        I wouldn't hurt her.

              And then he shoots Luther. Right between the buttons.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        I never break my word.

              Laughs as Rosalie begins to scream.

              CATES' CADDY

              Barreling down the street, ignoring red lights.





              Hammond shouts over the wind.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Notice something funny about that
                        bus?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah. It missed the last four
                        stops.

              Cates pours on the gas.

              BILLY BEAR

              His eyes fall on the rear view mirror. A white Caddy dances
              in the vibrating glass. Billy looks over his shoulder at Ganz.

                                  BILLY
                        Ganz!

              THE CADDY

              Swerves into cross traffic, makes a big press forward. Comes
              abreast of the driver's side of the bus.

              GANZ

              Smashes a side window with the two handguns.

              Blasts away.

              Cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun.

              CATES

              Looks up as glass shards sparkle down.

              He speeds up ... he is neck and neck with the bus.

              Hammond has a clear shot of Billy Bear who gives a side
              glance at him;

              Hammond doesn't shoot...

              Cates slows down and fires...

              Billy is hit in the shoulder. Ganz runs up and fires again...
              Hammond is hit in the arm. Cates grabs Hammond by the shirt.
              Yanks him close. Throws the wheel over ...

              CADDY

              Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side. Stuffing flies
              out of Hammondis still warm seat. The right hand windows
              explode. Then the Caddy spins out.







              THE BUS

              Roars away...

              THE CADDY

              Skids into a traffic sign, demolishing some newspaper
              machines. Cates curses, tries to start the car. The engine
              won't turn over. He looks at the distant bus.

                                  CATES
                        Goddamn! Goddamn!  Goddamn!

              Pounds on the dash. What's left of the windshield falls in at
              the impact.

              TRANSITION.

              SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

              Cates at his desk. Hammond seated nearby, now with a bandaged
              arm.  Haden in front of Cates, furious.

                                  HADEN
                        A bus, you goddamn whiskey mick
                        cop, you lost a stolen bus... We
                        got five deaths related to Ganz,
                        all of 'em law enforcement
                        related, and you blow it for a
                        lousy nigger convict...

              Cates says nothing...

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        That's rights I called him a
                        nigger.  You bet I did ... I saw
                        the report on that little piece of
                        shit.  If he spent one legal day
                        in his whole life, it'd be a
                        record...This is it for you...
                        suspension, review board... you've
                        had it.  When it gets 'round you
                        protect a con rather than nail a
                        cop killer...

              Cates stands up.

                                  CATES
                        He's got more brains and more guts
                        in one corner of his asshole than
                        any cop I've worked with.










                                  HADEN
                        Just cause you say it with
                        conviction don't mean shit to
                        me... How you gonna take to a pink
                        slip, huh?.

              Cates stands. Moves to Hammond. Handcuffs himself to him.

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        Where the Christ do you think
                        you're going?

                                  CATES
                        I'm taking my prisoner back to
                        jail.

              Hammond looks at Haden.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Goin' a little hard on him, aren't
                        you?

                                  HADEN
                        Go fuck yourself convict.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You know for a man, you have very
                        pretty brown eyes.

              Cates and Hammond walk out.

              UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

              Cates and Hammond walk stoically along a row of cars, arrive
              at Hammond's Porsche.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, how'd my car get here?

                                  CATES
                        I had it impounded.  Come on,
                        we'll use it for haulin' you back
                        to the slam.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz
                        got away. Got all my money. It
                        just don't seem right.

                                  CATES
                        I don't know about you, but I
                        could use a drink... I'll buy you
                        one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

              Takes off Hammond's cuffs.  Looks at them.. Throws them away.






                                  HAMMOND
                        Sorry we didn't do better, Jack.
                        I feel like I let you down.

                                  CATES
                        Naw, you didn't let me down.  It
                        was a long shot all the way.  We
                        gave 'em a good run at it.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.

              They get in and drive off.

              TRANSITION.

              EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

              The Porsche blasts by ... These men want a drink.

              TRANSITION.

              CHRONICLE RESTAURANT AND BAR - NIGHT

              Cates and Hammond walk in. It's late, the place is almost
              empty. The Bartender is a woman with her back to them
              conferring with a waitress about something.

                                  HAMMOND
                        It's late, they're closing...

                                  CATES
                        Don't worry about it.

              The barmaid turns around to take their order.  It's Elaine.

                                  ELAINE
                        Hey, I don't believe it.

                                  CATES
                        Hiya, kid.

                                  ELAINE
                        I ought to have you and your
                        friend thrown out...

                                  CATES
                        Don't.  We've had a hard night.

                                  ELAINE
                        I can see that.  Pardon me for
                        saying so, but you look like
                        shit.  What happened?









                                  CATES
                        We and my pal here have been
                        taking it on the chin for the last
                        few hours...

              Hammond looks at her. He nudges Cates.

                                  ELAINE
                        Who the hell are you?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond.
                        I heard a lot about you. And any
                        friend of Jack's is a friend of
                        mine.

              Gives her a big smile.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm not so sure I can say the same
                        thing...You don't look like a cop.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Well, I been workin' the other
                        side of the street for the last
                        few years.  And you don't exactly
                        look like a shrink, wearin' that
                        dress...

                                  ELAINE
                        Shrink major, not a shrink.

              She pours three glasses of cognac. A STRAGGLER at the end of
              the bar pipes up.

                                  STRAGGLER
                        Hey, lady, a drink here.

                                  ELAINE
                        We're closed.

                                  STRAGGLER
                        Hey, what the hell?

              Elaine turns to him; it's short and sweet.

                                  ELAINE
                        Drink your drink, pay up and get
                        out.

                                  STRAGGLER
                        You can't do this.  It's against...

                                  ELAINE
                        Hey, just fuck off.  My friends
                        have guns.






              Cates holds up his pistol. The man's eyes widen and he turns
              his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar.
              Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches.

                                  ELAINE
                               (continuing)
                        You real down?

                                  CATES
                        I've been better...Dead end.  No
                        Ganz, no Indian.

              He finishes his drink, puts down the glass.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        I gotta call the station.

              Looks back at Hammond...

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Don't run off anywhere, okay?
                        I've already got enough to worry
                        about.

              Moves away.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hard man to live with.

                                  ELAINE
                        How would you know?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, two days with him is enough.

                                  ELAINE
                        That's no bull.

              She looks at him carefully. They both grin.

              CATES

              In the phone booth.

                                  CATES
                        Is there any report ... No ...
                        Just tell me... nothing..Yeah I
                        figured... Okay, sure.

              Hangs up.

              ELAINE AND HAMMOND

              Cates returns...






                                  CATES
                        Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No
                        sign of the Indian.  Airport's
                        clean.  Train station. Bus
                        station.  Docks... Shit...

                                  ELAINE
                        Ganz is going to be hard to track.
                        Just a pure schizo ... wires all
                        crossed... totally without any
                        pattern... kill anybody... The
                        Indian... himself... anybody...

                                  CATES
                        How do you know?

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, it's all over the papers.
                        He's an obvious type.  But this
                        Indian...

              Hammond cuts in.

                                  HAMMOND
                        He was the only one of my bunch
                        that was my friend... He was
                        loyal, went all the way for you...

                                  ELAINE
                        In all due respect, he sounds kind
                        of pathetic to me.  The kind of
                        guy that runs home to his momma or
                        some girlfriend.  Have you two ace
                        detectives checked that out?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well the only woman of the
                        Indian's we ran into was shacked
                        up with her dyke girlfriend.  I
                        guess she went with him before she
                        came outta the Closet ... They
                        both looked mad enough to kill
                        him...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, too bad.  They were real
                        nice lookin' too...In bed
                        together, hardly any clothes one
                        watching TV...

                                  ELAINE
                        What makes you think they were
                        lesbians, or as you so quaintly
                        put it, dykes?








                                  CATES
                        Come on, they were a little old
                        for a slumber party.

                                  ELAINE
                        It might pay to reexamine a few of
                        your more primitive notions.  I
                        was in bed with a girlfriend
                        watching TV last week, Jack, and
                        one thing we know about me is I
                        happen not to be a lesbian ...
                        Now, if this Indian's girlfriend
                        got upset when you came looking
                        for him, it could just be she's
                        still vulnerable to him.

                                  CATES
                        So what?

                                  ELAINE
                        When a guy hurts you, then comes
                        back bleeding on his hands and
                        knees, who knows, he might just be
                        irrestible.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, Come on, shrink time's over.
                        They wouldn't go see some old
                        girlfriend.

                                  ELAINE
                        Oh, yeah, well look where you came
                        when you were down and out.

                                  HAMMOND
                        She's got a point there, Jack.

              Smiles. Cates reflects for a moment.

                                  CATES
                        It's the only thing we got.

              He looks at Elaine.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Whaddya think?

                                  ELAINE
                        What do I know?  I'm just a
                        bartender.

                                  CATES
                        Let's go, Reggie.

              He kisses Elaine.






                                  HAMMOND
                        Do I get to kiss her too?

                                  CATES
                        If she's right, and if you don't
                        screw up.

              They exit the bar.

              TRANSITION.

              EXT.  STREET - CHINATOVIN - NIGHT

              Cates and Hammond hidden in a doorway which affords them a
              good view of the alley landing to Casey and Sally's apartment.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What if your girl's theory turns
                        out to be bullshit?  I mean, they
                        could be in Rio de Janeiro.

                                  CATES
                        I've got to play it rough with
                        them. If they know anything, I'm
                        gonna know it.

              A woman appears, turning out to be Casey carrying a shopping
              bag.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, there she is...

                                  CATES
                        Whatever play I maker just back me
                        up.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If we run into Billy first, let me
                        try and talk him in.

                                  CATES
                        Sure, I'll give you a shot at it,
                        but Ganz is mine.  You know, that
                        big Indian plays it for keeps...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't
                        no sweetheart... I wouldn't like
                        it if this partnership ended
                        before it gets started.

                                  CATES
                        Partnership?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Well, you got to admit we come a
                        long way.





              Cates gives him a smile.

                                  CATES
                        Let's just do it.

              APARTMENT STAIRWELL

              As Casey opens the door and starts toward the.stairs, Cates
              and Hammond come through the door and grab her. They are now
              on the ground floor stairwell.

                                  CATES
                        I hear you've got visitors.

                                  CASEY
                        Would you guys...

                                  CATES
                        No time for any of that crap any
                        more, lady... I'll rip your lungs
                        out if you don't answer fast.

              Cates has her by the shoulder and arm; he twists her like a
              vise...

                                  HAMMOND
                        He means it...

              She looks at Cates, knows Hammond's correct.

                                  CASEY
                        Don't kill him.  Please, just
                        don't kill him.

              A long moment.

                                  CATES
                        You and the other one, you're
                        still Billy's girls. You always
                        were his girls...

                                  CASEY
                        Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love
                        with him, who wouldn't be...

                                  CATES
                        You're gonna help us take him.

                                  CASEY
                        No chance.

                                  CATES
                        He can live or die ... You let us
                        in and he's got a chance to make
                        it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.







              Casey's face is seared with pain at the thought of Billy
              dying.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If you help use he's got a chance,
                        lady.

                                  CASEY
                        Billy's in the first room off the
                        hall ... With rosalie ... He's
                        makin' her happy tonight.  You
                        don't understand about the way it
                        is with him, do ya?

                                  CATES
                        Where's ganz?

                                  CASEY
                        In the back.  Down the other
                        corridor.

              Cates looks at Reggie.

                                  CATES
                        Looks like you're gonna get your
                        chance.

              They move upward...

              INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

              Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor
              of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at
              a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very
              front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back.

              INT. FIRST BEDROOM

              There is a bed and  Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is
              seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on
              his boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Give it up, Billy.  You got no
                        shot at it.

              Billy stands.

                                  ROSALIE
                        Don't let him hurt met Billy.
                        You're not gonna let 'em hurt me,
                        are ya?

                                  BILLY
                        He won't hurt you.  He ain't gonna
                        do nothin' to you, he's just after
                        me.





                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm tellin' ya, Billy, give it up.

                                  BILLY
                        I never was much for bein'
                        rehabilitated.

              Billy looks at Hammond.  With lightning sudden quickness, he
              reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.
              Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he
              leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big
              slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as
              Rosalie shrieks.

              INT. BACK BEDROOM

              Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off
              the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and
              starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the
              briefcase and runs to the window.

              INT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM

              Cates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the
              door...

              He pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot
              which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape...

              INT. BACK BEDROOM

              Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears
              and futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the
              bed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window...

              EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

              Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops
              for a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then
              starts to run. Cates keeps coming...

              INT. FIRST BEDROOM

              Hammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room...

              CATES

              Dives down the fire escape.

              BATHROOM

              Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally
              crying hysterically ... He runs out.

              EXT. CHINATOWN STREET

              Ganz runs out the back alley ...Cates pursues...





              ALLEY

              Hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building.

              EXT. STREET

              Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with
              neon light. Cates pursues.

              EXT. FRONT OF CASEY'S BUILDING

              Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street.

              CATES

              Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a
              shot off...

              PARALLEL STREET

              Hammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is
              being chased...

              MAIN STREET

              Cates fires at Ganz ... Ganz ducks in a doorway...

              HAMMOND

              on his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a
              narrow alley between two buildings....

              EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY

              Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of
              Cates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is
              Hammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage
              can in his path, dropping him like a stone.

              CATES

              Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his
              arm around Hammond's throat and his gun to his ear...

                                  GANZ
                        Drop it... you come up against me,
                        you're gonna lose...

              Hammond drops his gun.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, cop, come on...l got
                        something for ya... come on...








              EXT.  MAIN STREET

              Cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and
              comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it
              down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand
              that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag.
              Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...

                                  GANZ
                        After I get outta this, cop...I'm
                        gonna live forever...

                                  CATES
                        I don't think you're gonna make it.

                                  GANZ
                        Whaddya mean...I got your gun ...
                        I got his money... I got
                        everything...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Give up.  He's crazy.  He'll kill
                        us both.

              Cates still walking...

                                  GANZ
                        He won't try it. He's a fucking
                        chickenshit cop. They're all
                        fucking wimps, right, Cates?

              They are now closer to each other. Ganz holding Hammond and
              the money...

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Okay, cop ... give me your gun and
                        I'll let him live. Come on, Cates,
                        you're real good at giving up your
                        gun.

              Cates keeps the same methodical pace...

                                  CATES
                        Sure...

              Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz
              also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet
              backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the
              ground, looks at Cates.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd
                        really do it. You are crazy.

              Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.
              Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.





              Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look
              of childish disbelief passes over his face.

                                  GANZ
                        I got hit.  I can't believe it. I
                        got shot.

                                  CATES
                        You're done.  End of story.

                                  GANZ
                        I ain't gonna beg for my life. It
                        ain't cool.

              He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is
              stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his
              chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of
              Ganz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yours?

              Cates raises the pistol.

                                  CATES
                        Mine...

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You okay?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a
                        second.

                                  CATES
                        You did pick a real strange time
                        to go and be brave all on your
                        own...

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Just tryin' to get the money,
                        Jack.  Just tryin' to build up a
                        few points on that merit system.

              Cates smiles back, picks up the black bag as they move off.

              TRANSITION.

              ELAINE'S BATHROOM

              Cates in the tub, steam rushing from the water.






              Elaine sits on the porcelain edge as he splashes and soaps...

                                  ELAINE
                        How'd they take it back at
                        headquarters?

                                  CATES
                        Usual bullshit.  You make one
                        smart move and everybody wants to
                        be your friend... You know
                        somethin', shootin' guys sucks.
                        Especially compared to this.

                                  ELAINE
                        I've been waiting a long time to
                        hear you say that.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the
                        time is a real drag, but it works.

              He reaches out, lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on
              the floor.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Three more hours...

                                  ELAINE
                        Where is he?

                                  CATES
                        Promised I'd turn my back while
                        he... ah, never mind...

                                  ELAINE
                        Tell me.

                                  CATES
                        He's takin' care of the same
                        business I'll be takin' care of -
                        soon as I dry off.

              Elaine smiles, leans close.

                                  ELAINE
                        You're impossible...

                                  CATES
                        That's what I always say.

              TRANSITION.

              CANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT

              Minimal crummy hotel room accommodations... Hammond is
              kissing her at the door, finishing buttoning all his buttons.





              He reaches for a wallet, gives her several bills.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Here you go, baby.

                                  CANDY
                        Hey, don't do that.  I said I
                        wasn't a pro, remember?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice.
                        Buy yourself something pretty.
                        I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got
                        this cop waitin' for me...

              They kiss... it's pretty romantic... She opens the door for
              him.

              CORRIDOR

              She stands at the top of the stairs; as Hammond walks down,
              he calls back to her over his shoulder ...

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'll be back in six months...
                        Maybe I'll make an honest woman of
                        you.

              He gives her a big sniile.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        I'll buy ya the best dinner in San
                        Francisco...how'd that be? Then
                        we'll go dancin', okay?

                                  CANDY
                        Now you're talkin'. See ya...

              He moves off, still smiling, holding the black briefcase...

              STREET - NIGHT

              on a picturesque hill above the Haight. Cates standing near
              the wheel of Hammond's Porsche.  Hammond comes down the porch
              steps from the hotel.

                                  CATES
                        Okay, reggie, start bustin' my
                        chops... Tell me how great you
                        were with that chick.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, Jack, real men don't have to
                        go in for that macho bullshit ...
                        but I was fantastic.







                        As a riatter of fact, I was so
                        good, I may have my cock done in
                        bronze.

              Cates holds up the black briefcase.

                                  CATES
                        I guess this is what you want to
                        talk about...All the pretty money
                        that's inside here.

              Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the
              case, locks the trunk.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been
                        waitin' three years for that.  I
                        don't think it's fair, man. What
                        about the merit system.? You were
                        gonnna give me a few thousand.

                                  CATES
                        There's nothin' to talk about.

              Another long exchange of looks. Then be hands Hammond the
              keys to the trunk.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        It's your money.  It'll be here in
                        six months when you get out.

                                  HAMMOND
                        And you're tellin' me you don't
                        want any of this cash?

                                  CATES
                        That's right. Not my style,
                        Reggie..

                                  HAMMOND
                        You are an awesomely weird cop.
                        Sure wish there were more like you
                        runnin' around out here.

                                  CATES
                        No, you don't. If I ever get word
                        of you steppin' over the line
                        again, I'm gonna ventilate that
                        suit of yours.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Spare met Jack. I'm into legit
                        investments from here on in.







              Cates gives him a very skeptical look, as they head for the
              car.

              Hammond gets in behind the wheel, Cates on the passenger side.

              Cates takes out a cigarette, starts to light it.

              Hammond takes the match does it for him.

                                  CATES
                        Thanks.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No trouble, Jack. But, listen,
                        suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd
                        you get the idea that you could
                        catch me?

              They both smile. Hammond socks it into gear and they drive
              off into the far distance...

                                             END.
FADE IN:

              OPEN COUNTRY - DAY

              Endless green hills bisected by a ribbon of highway. A road
              gang clearing brush by the side of the road... Twenty-five
              men in prison fatigues sweating through their mid-afternoon
              labor.

              THREE GUARDS

              Flank the working prisoners... Mountie hats, shotguns,
              sidearms, sunglasses; they look like they mean it.

              HIGHWAY

              A battered pickup appears...approaches. Suddenly, it coughs,
              shudders, stalls. A big Blackfoot Indian named BILLY BEAR
              gets out and starts cursing and kicking the vehicle.Then he
              begins walking toward the road gang...

              ROADSIDE

              BRADY is the Guard near the center of the work gang; he
              smiles at the oncoming man, pokes a prisoner beside him.

                                  BRADY
                        Wonder what reservation they let
                        him off of...

              The prisoner is GANZ who looks up, grins at Brady...

                                  GANZ
                        Yeah, there goes the neighborhood.

              Brady laughs as Billy Bear closes in on him.

                                  BILLY
                        Say, buddy, my engine's
                        overheating and I got 30 miles
                        before the next station... Could
                        I get some water out of your
                        cooler?

              Ganz leans on his hoe, speaks as Billy passes...

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe you shoulda stole a better
                        truck, Tonto.

                                  BILLY
                        You got a real big mouth, convict.

                                  BRADY
                        It's okay, chief.  He's just
                        joking...

                                  BILLY
                        How about the water...






                                  GANZ
                        Firewater, Tonto?  Is that what
                        you...

              Billy whirls, swings at Ganz. Both men roll to the ground.

                                  BRADY
                        Hey! Jesus Christ!

              THE OTHER GUARDS

              Seeing the commotion, they run toward it.

              GANZ AND BILLY

              As they struggle, Billy slips a pistol into Ganz' hand.

                                  BRADY
                        That's a state prisoner,
                        asshole...! Back off...

              ROADSIDE

              Brady pulls Billy away from Ganz just 'as one of the other
              officers arrives... Ganz suddenly whips out a pistol, shoots
              Brady at point-blank range. Before the other Guards can even
              react, Billy comes out with his own pistol, caps the Second
              Guard.

              THIRD GUARD

              Still forty yards away... In mid-draw, be howls as a bullet
              from Ganz breaks the nearby ground. He fires, then turns and
              runs for the prison bus.

              GANZ

              Smiling, fires twice. but the range is too great for pistol
              work...

              THE OTHER PRISONERS

              Watching....Then they all scatter in different directions...

              GANZ

              Hefts his weapon...

                                  GANZ
                        Come on...

              He and the big Indian run to the pickup, climb in and roar
              away.

              INT. BUS

              The THIRD GUARD making a call on the police radio...





                                  OFFICER

                                  OFFICER
                        Escape in progress. Two officers
                        shot off rail crossing 31.
                        Prisoners escaping. Two men, one
                        six-four, 200 pounds, dark, an
                        Indian, the other, Albert Ganz,
                        five-ten...

              FURTHER DOWN THE HIGHWAY

              Several miles from the escape... A big semi parked by the
              side of ttie road; back doors to the closed trailer open. A
              station wagon parked across the road. The pickup appears,
              approaches the semi, slows down and drives up the ramp into
              the van. Ganz and Billy jump out, shove the ramp up inside
              the truck and close the big doors.

              STATION WAGON

              Ganz and Billy climb inside ancl roar off, back in the
              direction of the road gang.

              BILLY BEAR

              Takes off his hat, puts on a baseball cap and sunglasses...

                                  BILLY
                        Get ready to duck.

              Ganz dives for the floor. Three police cars go by, sirens
              blaring, lights flashing. They pass the road gang. Ganz
              reappear, smiles...

                                  GANZ
                        You know something? I'm having a
                        real good time.

              HIGHWAY

              The station wagon blasts down the pavement... Becomes a small
              dot on the landscape.

              TRANSITION.

              A DOORWAY - NIGHT

              the portal slams open revealing a man holding a huge
              pistol,jack cates, s.F.P.D., a large and powerful man... He
              stealthily moves up a stairwell.






              CORRIDOR

              He stops at the top of the stairs... Listens gun still ready.
              A continuous sound of running water... Cates moves toward the
              bathroom. Rips the door open.

              BATHROOM

              The shape behind the shower curtain freezes. Cates, gun held
              level, moves forward... Rips the shower curtain open.
              Revealing a young and very beautiful woman, ELAINE MARSHALL.

                                  CATES
                        Inspector Jack Cates, S.F.P.D....
                        And you're wanted.

              Elaine stares at him as Cates turns off the water.

                                  ELAINE
                        What am I wanted for?

                                  CATES
                        I don't answer questions, I ask
                        'em...

              A moment as she continues to stare at his pistol.

                                  ELAINE
                        I don't think your gun's loaded...

                                  CATES
                        This is a .44 Magnum, the most
                        powerful handgun in the world. You
                        gotta ask yourself just one
                        question. Are you feelin' lucky?

                                  ELAINE
                        I still don't think it's loaded.

              Elaine shakes her head and smiles, folds her arms over her
              breasts, shivers a little... Cates looks at the cylinder,
              spins it...

                                  CATES
                        Hey, you're right.

                                  ELAINE
                        You're hopeless.

                                  CATES
                        That's the way I see it, too.

              Be puts the gun down on the edge of the sink, embraces her.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm all wet.






                                  CATES
                        What's wrong with that?

              They both smile.

              TRANSITION.

              BEDROOM

              Cates in bed with Elaine.  She wears his shirt.

                                  ELAINE
                        A guy in the bar called me a dumb
                        bitch today.

                                  CATES
                        What'd you do?

                                  ELAINE
                        Irrigated his face with the shot
                        of J and B I'd just poured him.
                        Then I tried to deck the sucker.

                                  CATES
                        I guess he got the message...

                                  ELAINE
                        Then I sit back and I think, I
                        mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb
                        bitch.  I work in a bar, right?
                        I can't read a list of my academic
                        credentials to every booze-hound
                        that comes in the place... You are
                        what you do...

                                  CATES
                        Positive self-image problem all
                        over again ... You are who you
                        decide you are unless you're the
                        type that lets assholes decide for
                        you.

                                  ELAINE
                        Aren't you the one that thinks all
                        psychotherapy is bullshit?

                                  CATES
                        I do think all psychotherapy is
                        bullshit. But just because I think
                        it's bullshit doesn't mean I don't
                        know something about it.

                                  ELAINE
                        If this is your idea of
                        sympathetic interest in my
                        problems, I'll take brutal
                        indifference.





                                  CATES
                        Hey, you know what I really think?

                                  ELAINE
                        Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.

                                  CATES
                        I think you're ashamed to tend bar
                        which is sad because you look
                        great in that outfit they make you
                        wear... You pull down four bills
                        a week which is damn good, and you
                        mix the best Pina Coladas I've
                        ever had... I think that if you
                        need bigger and better things ...
                        then go for em.

              She smiles at him after this. It looks like they'll kiss.
              Their faces are close.  Then she lightly moves back.

                                  ELAINE
                        You oversimplify every...

              He stops her in the middle of the sentence by kissing her,
              then pulls back...

                                  CATES
                        Some things are simple, right?

              Their faces are very close ... but they don't touch for
              another second.

                                  ELAINE
                        Right...

              TRANSITION.

              SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

              Titles continue.

              Tugs churning across the bay... Quiet city streets. Parked
              cars covered with early morning dew... A newspaper truck
              slowly grinds by, drops a bundleand moves on.

              EMBARCADERO - DAWN

              The station wagon pulls up to a young punk, HENRY WONG, on a
              motorcycle.

              Billy Bear smiles and leans out the driver's side window.

                                  BILLY
                        You got somethin' for us, Henry?

              Henry produces some credit cards.  Billy passes them to Ganz
              for inspection.





                                  GANZ
                        How hot are they?

                        Can't complain.

                                  GANZ
                        We got a lot to talk about.

                                  HENRY
                        Yeah, old times.

                                  GANZ
                        We'll follow you.  Take it
                        slow,okay?

                                  HENRY
                        Sure, right.

              Ganz pockets the credit cards as Henry wheels away.

              INT.  STATION WAGON

                                  GANZ
                        I want to drive awhile.

                                  BILLY
                        I ain't tired yet.

              INT.  STATION WAGON

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe after we get done with him
                        I'm gonna buy us some girls.

                                  BILLY
                        Whaddya mean, buy?

                                  GANZ
                        Pros.

              Ganz stares at Billy.

                                  BILLY
                        Pay money?

                                  GANZ
                        Yeah, dummy.  Money.





                                  BILLY
                        I never paid for it in my life.

                                  GANZ
                        It's better when you pay... they
                        let you do anything.

                                  BILLY
                        They always let me do anything. I
                        don't want to pay for it.  I never
                        paid for it in my life.

                                  GANZ
                        Just do what I say, okay? We'll
                        pay for the girls and have a good
                        time... Don't you trust me?

              Billy smiles.

                                  BILLY
                        Sure, I trust ya.

              They drive off.

              NORTH BEACH - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAWN

              First light breaks over Telegraph Hill. A quiet row of
              Victorian townhouses now converted into apartments.

              APARTMENT BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

              Cates is sprawled across the double bed; Elaine is on the
              verge of falling off the edge. Cates' eyes snap open.  A
              second later, his wrist watch alarm goes off.  He turns it
              off, gets out of bed and begins pulling on his pants. Elaine
              sits up in bed, still wearing Cates' blue shirt... Cates
              picks up a robe as Elaine gets out of bed on the opposite
              side, throws the robe to Elaine... She takes off the shirt,
              swaps it for the robe and throws the shirt to Jack.

                                  ELAINE
                        You know, if you let me come over
                        to your place once in a while, you
                        could put on a clean shirt in the
                        morning.

                                  CATES
                        What makes you think I have any
                        clean shirts at my place?

              He buttons his shirt and heads for the kitchen.

              KITCHEN

              Cates brushing his teeth at the sink, Elaine making coffee.







                                  ELAINE
                        You know, that's my toothbrush,
                        Jack.

              He keeps brushing.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe you ought to buy me one.

                                  ELAINE
                        Maybe I would if I knew when you
                        were coming back.

              He stops brushing, turns and looks at her.

                                  CATES
                        I'm here.  And I've been coming
                        back for quite awhile... Let's not
                        hassle, okay?  And can I have a
                        cup of coffee?  Please.

              She pours some coffee, hands him a cup and saucer... Cates
              pours some whiskey into it from a flask.

                                  ELAINE
                        That's a fairly crummy way to
                        start a morning.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe I got a fairly crummy day
                        ahead.

                                  ELAINE
                        Maybe that makes a nice excuse.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe you don't know what the hell
                        you're talking about.

              Cates picks his holstered .44 off a chair back and begins
              strapping it on.

                                  ELAINE
                        When you start with that
                        attitude... it's like I don't know
                        who you are.

                                  CATES
                        What do you want to know?  What
                        difference does it make?  I'm the
                        guy in your bed the last three
                        months.  I make you feel good. You
                        make me feel good.  What the hell
                        else do you want from a guy?








                                  ELAINE
                        I wish you'd stop trying to make
                        me mad so I won't care for you...
                        I wish you'd give me a little more
                        of a chance.

              He turns away, moves into the corridor near the stairwell.

                                  CATES
                        I don't have time for this. I
                        gotta go to work.

              She stands frozen... He turns back and looks at her; it's
              hard to apologize.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Look, I'm glad I'm in your life...
                        and hell, with an ass like yours,
                        I figure anything might be
                        possible.

              She is warmed up by the first part, amused by the second; she
              approaches...

                                  ELAINE
                        You know something, Jack, you
                        really are hopeless.

                                  CATES
                        That's the way I see it, too.

                                  ELAINE
                        Call me later.

                                  CATES
                        You sure you want me to?

                                  ELAINE
                        Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...

              He moves closer, kisses her..

                                  CATES
                        Thanks for the coffee.

                                  ELAINE
                        I think you forgot this. Hands him
                        his wallet and badge...

                                  CATES
                        Guess people ought to know who I
                        am...

              He turns to go down the stairwell...







                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, wait.  Here...

              She puts a scarf around his neck.

                                  ELAINE
                               (continuing)
                        It's cold as hell out these
                        mornings, and you know what the
                        man said, the coldest winter I
                        ever spent was the summer I spent
                        in San Francisco...

              They don't kiss.  He nods appreciately, the scarf in hand as
              he turns and goes.

              STREET - NORTH BEACH - MORNING

              Cates comes out of Elaine's apartment building, crosses to
              his whipped and battered  64 Cadillac convertible, notices a
              parking ticket stuck under the windshield wiper...

                                  CATES
                        Son of a bitch.

              Shoves the ticket in his coat pocket, gets into the Caddie
              puts the scarf around the rear view mirror, starts the engine
              and guns away...

              CITY STREET

              Cates driving the convertible; he comes down a hill and turns
              toward the East Bay...

              TRANSITION.

              GOLDEN GATE PARK - MORNING

              Henry Wong, seated on a park bench. Now very dead, a bullet
              hole in the middle of his forehead. Billy Bear is seated next
              to him on the bench reading the race form.

              GANZ

              Using the telephone at an outdoor booth a few feet beyond the
              bench.

              STREET - BROADWAY DISTRICT - DAY

              LUTHER and ROSALIE, a young couple, turn a corner.  A dark
              parody of all-American young marrieds.  They are bickering as
              usual.

                                  ROSALIE
                        I liked that carpet we saw.







                                  LUTHER
                        We can't afford it.

                                  ROSALIE
                        Don't remind me.

                                  LUTHER
                        Whaddya want me to do, go out and
                        steal for the money?  I hated the
                        color anyway; the color sucked...

              Suddenly, Billy and Ganz descend on Luther and Rosalie and
              pull them into their station wagon..

              INT.  STATION WAGON

              Billy has Rosalie by the mouth, gagging her with his big
              paw... Ganz has his gun at Luther's neck.

                                  GANZ
                        Surprise, Luther.

                                  LUTHER
                        Whaddya want?  I thought you were
                        locked up-

                                  GANZ
                        I want the money, asshole, what do
                        you think?  The money that Reggie
                        hid...

                                  LUTHER
                        I don't know what you're talkin'
                        about.

                                  GANZ
                        You want that Indian to snap her
                        neck?

              He mimes the gesture... snap...

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Instead of worryin' about Reggie,
                        you better worry about me...

                                  LUTHER
                        Don't give me this, we were
                        partners.

                                  GANZ
                        Billy, go ahead, break it...

                                  LUTHER
                        No! Don't kill her.  I can get you
                        the money.






                                  GANZ
                        When?

                                  LUTHER
                        I can't get it until Monday.
                        Honest.

                                  GANZ
                        You chickenshit punk...

                                  LUTHER
                        Honest. The place we stashed it
                        opens Monday morning. I can't get
                        it till then. Monday morning,
                        that's when it opens. After that,
                        I'll get the money to you right
                        away...

              Ganz finally takes the gun from the neck.

                                  GANZ
                        I always liked you, Luther. You
                        were always a lotta fun to hang
                        out with...

              Rosalie is rubbing her neck now that she's been released...
              Ganz gestures to Billy.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        We're gonna keep her.

              Luther desperately doesn't like this.

                                  LUTHER
                        Come on, you can trust me. Please.

                                  GANZ
                        You try to mess with us or go to
                        the cops, I promise you, I'll put
                        holes in her you wouldn't believe.

              He smiles at Luther, pinches him on the cheek, shoves him out
              of the car.

              LUTHER

              Stands shivering as it powers away.

              WALDEN HOTEL - DAY

              A small hotel on one of the quiet streets behind Union Square.

              A GREEN COUGAR

              Pulls up across the street.






              INT. CAR

              Tha car arrives in front of the hotel.

                                  GANZ
                        Nice place, huh?

              Rosalie is very nervous.

                                  ROSALIE
                        What are you gonna do to me in
                        there?

              Ganz gives her a casual smile.

                                  GANZ
                        Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut
                        your throat.

                                  BILLY
                        He's just kiddin', you just keep
                        doin' what I tell ya, you'll be
                        okay.

              They move out of the car, head for the hotel.

              LOBBY

              A FRIZZY YOUNG BLONDE sits behind the desk in a mirrored
              entrance hall.  She reads a lurid paperback. Morning traffic
              streams by outside as Ganz, Billy and Rosalie enter and
              approach the desk.

                                  GANZ
                        We need some rooms for a couple of
                        nights...Okay?

              She smiles at Ganz.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Sure.  We don't get many real
                        customers, ya know?  Most people
                        only stay an hour or two...

              Passes a form across. Ganz signs it, Frizzy glances at his
              signature then takes a key from the rack behind.

                                  GANZ
                        I want her young.  And tall. Nice
                        legs. Legs are important. Then,
                        real thin.  Yeah.  NO jeans-A
                        dress? a nice summer dress.  You
                        know I want her fresh... I'll tell
                        you why, because I been hoein'
                        weeds and makin' license plates
                        for a couple of years... Yeah, I
                        know you don't get it...





              BILLY BEAR

              Sees a couple approaching, he shoves the dead man down on the
              bench and spreads the newspaper over his head.  The body now
              looking like a typical park bum who has spent the night.
              Billy walks over to Ganz.

                                  BILLY
                        Hey, what about me?

                                  GANZ
                        And I need one more for my pal.
                        Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not
                        a turban, you know, a squaw.

              Billy smiles, takes the Polaroid...

              POLAROID

              A close shot of the dead man with the bullet hole in his
              forehead.

              GANZ

              Takes the photograph back from Billy and slips it into his
              jacket pocket...

                                  GANZ
                        Walden Hotel. Third near Broadway.
                        Tell them to ask for ... uh...

              He takes the hot credit cards out of his pocket, the name
              embossed on the plastic..

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        G.P. Polson...P.O.L.S.O.N....Just
                        be a couple of hours.

              Hangs up. The two men head for a green Plymouth...

              TRANSITION.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Number twenty-seven, Mr. Polson.

                                  GANZ
                        Put them next door, okay.

              She gives him a slightly knowing look.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Sure, hey, you got the whole floor
                        to yourself...

              Ganz sends her back a sharp look.






                                  GANZ
                        Keep your filthy ideas to
                        yourself, lady.

              Ganz picks up his suitcase, walks over to the nearest
              stairwell.  Billy and Rosalie follow...

              TRANSITION.

              STREET

              Bars starting to fill up with mid-day customers... A black
              Chevy cruises past and stops further up the block. Two
              Plainclothesmen, VANZANT and ALGREN, get out of the car. As
              they start toward the Walden...

              THE CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE

              Pulls up near the two men. Cates climbs out of his car and
              walks over to them.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, fellas, what's happening?
                        Radio said you guys had something
                        on...

                                  ALGREN
                        Not much, Jack ... Salesman named
                        Polson had his credit cards
                        lifted...

              Algren nods over to the parking lot opposite.

                                  ALGREN
                               (continuing)
                        One of Polson's cards rented that
                        green coupe.

                                  VANZANT
                        Not too much for a big rough tough
                        gunfighter like you to do on this
                        one...

              Cates smiles at the verbal positioning he's used to with his
              colleagues.

                                  CATES
                        Suspect packed or is this a
                        laugher?

                                  ALGREN
                        Five and dime stuff. Polson said
                        a kid with a switchblade mugged
                        him and drove off on a motorcyle.








                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well, I guess you two are
                        experts at taking boy scout knives
                        away from teenagers...

                                  VANZANT
                        Yeah, we are, that means you can
                        stay outta this one. We don't have
                        any big need for the artillery

              Vanzant's turn to smile.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, I'm just offering to help
                        out... I like to watch real pros
                        work.

                                  VANZANT
                        Help, huh?  Sometimes your kind of
                        help tends to leave the suspect in
                        bad shape.

              Algren...mediator... soothes the competitive situation.

                                  ALGREN
                        Hey, relax ... Jack, you wanna
                        come inside, fine... You can stake
                        out the lobby...

              Cates, a bit disgusted at the politics of this moment, nods...

                                  CATES
                        Fine, it's your show...

              The three men move toward the Walden.

              WALDEN HOTEL LOBBY

              Frizzy Blonde still behind the desk. Still reading the lurid
              paperback. Unaware as Vanzant and Algren approach... She
              looks up as they flash their badges.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Aw, you guys were in last week.
                        You better ask around.  I'm not
                        supposed to be hassled... I got
                        friends.

                                  VANZANT
                        Hey, park the tongue for a second,
                        sweetpants, we just want to search
                        a room.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Not unless you got a warrant.







                                  CATES
                        Maybe you should of been a lawyer
                        instead of a dumb skirt workin'
                        behind a register.

              Frizzy turns to find Cates standing beside her. He nudges her
              aside. Starts going throught the register book.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Aw, come on, what the shit is this?

                                  ALGREN
                        We're looking for a guy going
                        under the name Polson...

              Frizzy sits back down in defeat.

                                  FRIZZY
                        Okay, big deal.  Get it over with.

              Cates finds the name.

                                  CATES
                        Mr. Polson, room 27...

                                  ALGREN
                        Is he alone?

                                  FRIZZY
                        Naw, his sister went up an hour
                        ago.

              Vanzant turns to Cates.

                                  VANZANT
                        Okay, like we said, you stake out
                        the lobby.

                                  CATES
                        Sure. Great. Whatever.

                                  VANZANT
                        You're not missing out on
                        Dillinger. This punk just stole
                        some credit cards.

              Cates watches the two Detectives head for the elevator.

              SECOND FLOOR CORRIDOR

              Vanzant and Algren move down the hallwayStop at the far end.
              Both Detectives draw their pistols and approach a door.

              ROOM

              Summer dress and undergarments scatteredon the floor. LISA,
              lies naked under the covers.





              She matches Ganz's earlier requirements.Smoking a cigarette,
              staring at the ceiling. Ganz remains on top of the blanket.
              Still in his shirt and pants watching TV. Three sharp knocks
              at the door. Ganz reacts as if he's received an electric
              shock. His hand goes under the pillow... Comes up with an
              automatic. Shoves it hard into Lisa's stomach.

                                  LISA
                        Hey...

                                  GANZ
                        Shut up.

                                  LISA
                        What the hell's wrong?  I didn't
                        do anything.

              Another knock. Ganz makes her move to the door.

                                  LISA
                               (continuing)
                        What do you want?  What's goin' on?

                                  GANZ
                        Shut up.

              She grabs her dress and tries to pull it on.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Now ask who it is.

              Shoves harder with the pistol.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, ask.

              She calls out.

                                  LISA
                        Who is it?

              CORRIDOR

              Vanzant and Algren stand back from the door. Guns held ready.

                                  ALGREN
                        Police... open up.

              R00M

              Lisa looks from the door back to Ganz. Then at the gun held
              against her. She's petrified.

                                  GANZ
                        Stall.







                                  LISA
                        What do you want?

                                  VANZANT
                        Police business. Come on, open up.

              A smile on Ganz' face. Almost as if he's enjoying the moment.

                                  GANZ
                        Keep stallin'.



                                  LISA
                        Alright, I'm coming...hold on.

              I'll just be a minute.

              CORRIDOR

              Vanzant and Algren waiting. Sounds of movement from within
              the room.

              LOBBY

              Cates moves toward the foot of the stairwell. Looks across at
              mirror on the wall opposite. The entire lobby covered from
              this spot. Every angle, including Frizzy.

              ROOM

              Ganz gestures to Lisa.

                                  LISA
                        Just a second.

              Ganz belts her with his gun; she falls..Ganz goes through the
              connecting door. Slips into the adjacent room.

              BILLY'S ROOM

              Another Hooker cowers in the corner, pulling on her clothes.
              She's a Mexican girl in a ridiculous 'Indian' outfit.

                                  MEXICAN GIRL
                        Que paso? Que esta pasando? No
                        entiendo...

                                  BILLY
                        Shut up.

              Billy goes to where Rosalie is awkwardlytied to a chair with
              an electric dord.  He pulls her to her feet as Ganz moves by.







                                  BILLY
                               (continuing)
                        When I say jump, girl, you better
                        jump.



                                  BILLY
                               (continuing)

              CORRIDOR

              Vanzant reaches down, tries the knob.  Locked. Algren moves
              back, preparing to kick the door down.

              ADJACENT ROOM

              Ganz opens the door behind the two cops. Raises his pistol
              and fires. Billy's shots follow immediately. Hits Vanzant.
              Algren rolls just as Ganz fires again. Wounded, he gets off
              three shots, then moves inside Ganz' room. Ganz and Billy run
              for the elevator... Exchange two more shots with Algren. The
              Mexican Girl begins screaming in Spanish...

              LOBBY

              Cates draws his .44. Races up the stairs three at a time.
              Frizzy starts to frantically call the police.

              CORRIDOR

              Cates stops at the landing. Vanzant's body sprawled across
              the hallway. Algren back in the corridor, still losing
              blood... Leans against the wall for support... Lisa staggers
              out of the room, screams. Algren points the gun toward the
              elevator. Indicating where Ganz and Billy have just fled.
              Cates starts back down toward the lobby.

              ELEVATOR

              Ganz and Billy, guns ready as the carriage jolts downward.
              Rosalie is terrified, sobbing...

              CATES

              Arrives at the halfway turn of the second staircase. He takes
              the next flight in two jumps.

              ELEVATOR

              As the doors open, Ganz gestures for Billy and Rosalie to
              wait as he heads for the lobby.

              LOBBY








              Cates literally flies into the lobby just as Ganz appears. He
              slams Ganz against a column, belts him across the neck with
              his pistol. Ganz screams with pain, drops his gun... Cates
              again slams him with his pistol, felling him...

              GANZ

              Slides across the floor.

              CATES Senses something ... moves just as Billy appears behind
              and fires at him. The bullet takes out a window. Cates dives
              over the desk. Another bullet chews up the wood.

              LOBBY

              Frizzy has been standing beside her desk, screaming... Cates'
              move and the accompanying bulletspanic her. She dashes for
              safety... Cates gets to his feet behind cover. Sees Billy
              holding Rosalie by the throat. Frizzy begins to scream.

                                  GANZ
                        He'll blow her goddamn head off.

              Cates doesn't miss a beat. He slowly levels his .44. Takes
              careful aim and starts to fire at Billy.

                                  ROSALIE
                        No. No.

              Cates' shot narrowly misses Rosalie. The bullet smashes into
              a mirror above Billy's head. Cates keeps moving closer, gun
              pointed straight ahead. Billy pushes the pistol against
              Rosalie'temple. For the first time, Cates hesitates. They
              face each other across the length of the lobby.

              ALGREN

              Struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. He still
              holds his revolver. Dares not raise it towards Billy and
              Rosalie.

              BILLY BEAR

              Covers Algren from near the entrance.  He's confused, doesn't
              know what to do... He keeps hold of Rosalie.

              GANZ

              His eyes catch Algren's...

                                  GANZ
                        You.  Drop it and we won't kill
                        her.

              Algren tosses his gun to the floor.







                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Now, tell him to drop his Goddamn
                        piece.

                                  ALGREN
                        Do it, Cates.

              No response.

                                  ALGREN
                               (continuing)
                        Do it, Cates.  Goddamn it, do it.

              Cates lowers his gun. Finally lets it drop to the floor.

                                  GANZ
                        Kick it over here.

              Cates does; Ganz picks it up, smiles, looks at Billy.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Get the car.

              Then back to Cates as Billy runs out the entrance with
              Rosalie.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Your gun's just like mine.

              He's going to kill Cates. But first be glances at Algren.
              Then, almost casually, shoots him twice with Cates' .44.
              Algren staggers back. Dead before he hits the floor. Cates
              twists sideways just as Ganz fires. The bullet misses. Again
              Frizzy starts screaming and struggling. Ganz swipes the woman
              across the head with the gun. Her body slumps to the floor.
              Police sirens can be heard in the distance. Cates makes an
              attempt for Algren's gun. A bullet splatters against the
              floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. The gun
              skitters out of reach.

                                  CATES
                        You lying son of a bitch...

                                  GANZ
                        What are you talking about? We
                        didn't kill her ...

              Ganz smiles.

              With your own gun, cop. How does it feel? Cates leaps into a
              wooden phone booth. Ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth
              with both his and Cates' gun. Two bullets crash into the
              booth. Ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are
              ominously near. Ganz finally retreats out the entrance.





              STREET

              Billy and Rosalie weave their way across street to the
              Cougar. They make a U-turn. Ganz runs out. Car pulls out,
              then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.

              PHONE BOOTH

              Chunks of wood on the floor. Shafts of light through a dozen
              bullet holes. Shattered receiver dangling from a cord. Cates,
              wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. He drops to
              the floor.

              LOBBY

              The police arrive. Swarm into the hotel. All eyes on Cates as
              he rushes to Algren. Too late... Cates realizes Algren is
              dead. He cradles Algren's head as he stares at the arriving
              TAC Squad and Patrolmen.

              TRANSITION.

              SQUAD ROOM DAY

              Cates walks in. Several Detectives gather around him.

                                  FAT COP
                        What happened?

                                  CATES
                        Read the report.

                                  OLD COP
                        Two cops blown away by a credit
                        card booster... that don't figure.

                                  CATES
                        No shit.

                                  FAT COP
                        They were good cops.

                                  CATES
                        They were good cops who fucked up
                        and got careless.

              A snotty YOUNG COP paces.

                                  YOUNG COP
                        That's what you say, Cates...

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.









                                  YOUNG COP
                        But that's what you say about all
                        of us all the tine ... we're
                        always the ones fucking up when
                        you tell it...

                                  CATES
                        The truth hurts, doesn't it, buddy?

              Cates looks at the Old Cop.

                                  OLD COP
                        It don't figure.

                                  CATES
                        I need to borrow a piece.

              The OLD COP shrugs... looks in his desk...

                                  YOUNG COP
                        Somebody steals your gun, you're
                        supposed to file a report.

                                  CATES
                        Are you gonna tell me about police
                        procedure?  Do me a favor, don't
                        give me a bunch of crap.

                                  YOUNG COP
                        I guess when two cops die on
                        account of your fuck up you want
                        to keep it as quiet as possible...

              Cates loses it for a second, lands on him with both hands,
              pushes him against a wall... The room goes quiet. Cates cools
              down.

                                  CATES
                        Just shut the fuck up.

              The other cops don't intervene. They just watch.  Cates cools
              down, straightens up. HADEN walks by, or, rather, speeds by.

                                  HADEN
                        Cates, I'll need to see you in
                        five minutes, exactly five.

              The Old Cop hands Cates a gun, a traditional Army .45...

                                  OLD COP
                        Best I can do.

                                  HADEN
                        D'you read me, Cates...

              Haden continues moving away.






                                  CATES
                        Five minutes.  I heard you, your
                        voice carries...

              As Cates is examining the gun, RUTH, a lab technician, enters
              and drops three 8 x 10's on the desk near Cates.

                                  RUTH
                        They're still wet.

              Cates lifts the blow-ups, each one showing a different aspect
              of a spent bullet.

                                  RUTH
                               (continuing)
                        Lots of people getting shot with
                        .44's lately ... Last year, it was
                        Saturday Night Specials..now it's
                        heavy stuff. People must be
                        getting madder about something.

              Cates starts pinning the blow-ups onto a large bulletin board
              on the wall. Nearby, at the same time (within Cates' line of
              sight, within earshot), Lisa, the Hooker, is being
              interrogated by a POLICE-WOMAN who pulls the statement off
              the typewriter. Nearby, the Indian Hooker is being
              interrogated in Spanish.

                                  POLICEWOMAN
                        You're an accessory to Murder One,
                        so you're going to have to do a
                        whole lot better than what we got
                        down here, honey...

                                  LISA
                        Gimme a break, huh? ... Look, I
                        got there.  He was a trick just
                        like any other for all I knew.
                        That's all there is.  He didn't
                        feel like sitting and talking. He
                        was in a big hurry to get laid.
                        I was with him about an hour...

              Cates has gotten interested in the last part of this ...
              drifts toward her... A DETECTIVE comes through, begins
              distributing I.B.M. printouts to Cates, the other nearby
              officers..

                                  DETECTIVE
                        We got a print from the hotel
                        room.  Guy's real name is Ganz,
                        Albert Ganz.  A hitter from back
                        East but he worked out here a few
                        years back.  Armed robbery. Broke
                        out of prison two days ago and
                        capped two of the guards. A real
                        animal.  Wait'll you see this...





              Cates reads the printout, then smoothly,imperiously, he takes
              over the questioning of Lisa.

                                  CATES
                        Did he give you a return match?

                                  LISA
                        He wasn't interested.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe he didn't like your
                        performance.

                                  LISA
                        Fuck you.

                                  CATES
                        I'll take a raincheck...

              From the side, Ruth is pointing at the photos...

                                  RUTH
                        This'll interest you, Jack...we've
                        got something here from your
                        gun... and these are from the
                        first weapon Ganz used...

                                  CATES

              She turns, produces the third photo.  Pins it beside the one
              from the Walden Hotel.

                                  RUTH
                        A perfect match for the markings
                        from the first gun he used... but
                        not from the Walden Hotel... fired
                        at least six hours earlier...at
                        point blank range... right between
                        the eyes.  Found him on a park
                        bench...

              She shows him two more pictures.  Police forensics shots of
              Henry Wong ... very dead on the park bench...

                               (continuing)
                        Ya know, there are some very bad
                        people out there in the world.

                        Look at it this way, Ruth.  If
                        there weren't, what would there be
                        for us to do?

                        Anyway... so I got there and took
                        him down.  He started watching
                        television and then you
                        sensational people started banging
                        on the door... that's all...

              Cates looks up as he hears that remark.  Notices KEHOE,
              another Detective, entering with a long suitcase.

                        What makes you think so?

                                  LISA
                        I think he liked shooting cops a
                        lot more than getting laid.

              Cates watches Kehoe unpack the box.

                                  CATES
                        Is that what this guy Ganz had in
                        the hotel?



                                  KEHOE
                        Every last bit of it.  The big
                        guy's room was empty.

                                  CATES
                        I'll help you out.

              Cates and Kehoe start going through the suitcase.  Kehoe
              produces a speed loader for a .44...

                                  KEHOE
                        This guy must have had a .44 like
                        yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.

                                  CATES
                        Shit.

              Kehoe next produces several boxes of shells.








                                  KEHOE
                        This cat was real serious about
                        his artillery.

              An Attendant comes through, hands Kehoe a file. He opens it,
              shows the file to Cates who reads the name under the mug shot.

                        Backup man from the East Bay.
                        Worked with Ganz a few years ago
                        and sprung him from the road gang.

              Kehoe opens the second file.  Four mug shots are inside.

                                  CATES
                        Who are all these?

                                  KEHOE
                        They all pulled a bunch of jobs
                        with Ganz about four years ago.

                                  CATES
                        Wait a minute, wait a minute...
                        who's this?

                                  KEHOE
                        Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was
                        in on the same job.

              Cates spins the file around so that both Ruth an Kehoe can
              see it, throws the forensic shots down beside it.

                                  CATES
                        Tell me that's not the same guy.

                        Hey ... Dick Tracy.

                                  RUTH
                        Did Ganz have a grudge against his
                        old friends?

              Haden comes out of his office.

                                  HADEN
                        Get in here, Cates.

              Cates ignores him.

                                  CATES
                        I think I wanna have a discussion
                        about it with any of the ones
                        still walking.  Can we find them?






                                  KEHOE
                        Here's the file. Cates checks the
                        file.

              Cates walks into Haden's cubicle.

                                  CATES
                        I want to be left alone on this
                        one. Algren was killed with my gun.



                                  HADEN
                        Yeah, I read the report...

              Haden shuffles some papers, seems to ignore Cates.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I
                        want it back.

                                  HADEN
                        Jack, come on, there is an
                        official department policy about
                        cop killings. Cop killers
                        represent a special priority
                        because any man crazy enough to
                        kill a cop is a greater threat to
                        an unarmed civilian... In other
                        words, we can't seen like we're in
                        the revenge business... I know, we
                        all know the truth's a little
                        different.

              Cates almost smiles at Haden.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah...

                                  HADEN
                        Anthing botherin' you besides
                        losin' your gun?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get
                        hurt while I'm makin' a play. I
                        don't like it.









                                  HADEN
                        You might be more of a team player
                        and a little less of a hot dog on
                        this one, Jack.

                        Being a hot dog's worked pretty
                        well for me so far... Besides, I
                        got a lead...

                                  HADEN
                        Okay.  You're not a team player.
                        You gotta do things your own way.
                        Fine.  Nail this guy and make us
                        all look good.  But you better
                        watch your ass.  If you screw up,
                        I can promise you, you're goin'
                        down.

                                  CATES
                        You really know how to send a guy
                        out with a great attitude. He
                        starts to go.

                                  HADEN

                                  CATES
                        Yeah?

                                  HADEN
                        Try not to get your ass shot to
                        pieces. We got enough dead cops on
                        this one.

                                  CATES
                        I'll keep it in mind.

              Heavy vehicle and pedestrian traffic. Cates stands near a hot

                        wondering what's right and what's
                        wrong... There's a psycho out
                        there killing people with my gun
                        and I'm gonna get him.  Because
                        it's my job. And if you don't get

                        Everything else, especially me,
                        second. I get it. I don't like it.

              They move forward together.

                                  GUARD
                               (continuing)
                        It's Number Twenty-two... You want
                        company?

                                  CATES
                        No, no thanks.

              The Guard shrugs, stays by the door.







              CATES

              He walks down the cell block. Inmates stare at him from
              inside the stark cells. They don't know who he is, but they
              can smell a cop. Cates stops at Twenty-two, looks inside...
              a bit startled. Obviously, Reggie Hammond has connections and
              taste. The paint is fresh; there's framed prints on the wall
              instead of pin-ups, and the overall feeling is that of a
              graduate school dorm rather than a prison. Cates turns, nods
              to the Guard at the end of the cell block. He throws a switch
              and the door opens.

              HAMMOND'S CELL

              Cates steps inside. Hammond is at a table wearing a Sony
              Walkman and writing in some detailed ledgers with a fountain
              pen. He's boogeying in his seat to the music. Sprawled on a
              bunk nearby is LEROY, another black inmate close to Hammond's
              age. Leroy is leafing through a copy of a skin magazine. He
              doesn't even look at Cates.

                                  CATES
                        Hammond.

              Cates steps inside the cell.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Hammond!

              No answer. Cates leans over, hits the override button on the
              Sony.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Hammond!

              Hammond jumps, grabs his ears in pain ... He pulls the
              headset off and glares at Cates.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You got a name, cop?

                                  CATES
                        Try Cates.  And let's talk in
                        private, okay?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Sure, anything you want.

              He tosses the Walkman to Leroy who dutifully puts it on.

                                  CATES
                        Look, convict, I know all about
                        you. Single.  No fixed address. No
                        known relatives.







                        One previous conviction. Armed
                        robbery... six months to go on a
                        three-year sentence.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You here to write my life story?

                                  CATES
                        Not likely, Reggie.  Maybe I just
                        need some help.

              Cates takes the forensic photo out of his pocket, passes it
              across the table to Hammond.  He looks at it, hardly reacts.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Henry Wong... My old pal.  He's
                        looked better...

              He passes the photo back.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Look, I got just six months before
                        gettin' out of here.  Six months
                        between me and freedom after bein'
                        here three years... And I'm not
                        gonna do anything to screw it up,
                        includin' pee in the prison yard,
                        knock up the Warden's daughter or
                        rat on my old partners...

              Cates swings the cell door back open.

                                  CATES
                        Too bad, Reggie.  I thought maybe
                        you were a smart boy.  But I guess
                        if you were real smart you
                        wouldn't be a convict.

              He smiles, decides to play his card.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        I can see a second-rater like you
                        wouldn't be any help at all goin'
                        up against a real hard case like
                        Ganz.

              Hammond jerks his head around.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Ganz?

              Pause.







                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Ganz the one who shot Henry?
                        Cates, I asked you a question...

              Cates smiles.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, I noticed...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be
                        there two years after I'm on the
                        street.

                                  CATES
                        Didn't work out that way.  He
                        busted out with a big Indian.
                        They capped two guards on a road
                        gang. Nice meeting you Reggie.

              He turns, goes out. The door clangs behind him. Hammond jumps
              up and bangs on the bars, shouts at Cates' back...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Cates, Come back here.

              Cates turns, saunters back, leans against the door.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta
                        get me outta here first.

                                  CATES
                        You're crazy.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I can help you, man, but you gotta
                        get me out.  I got to be on the
                        street.  Get me outta here.

                                  CATES
                        What's the big deal about you
                        bein' on the street?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I got a lot to protect.

                                  CATES
                        Bullshit.

                                  HAMMOND
                        It's the only way you're gonna get
                        Ganz.





                                  CATES
                        I'll think about it.

              TRANSITION.

              Cates typing several of official looking documents while
              seated across from a rather dour-looking bureaucrat named BOB.

                                  CATES
                        Let me borrow your pen, Bob.

              Handed over by Bob.

                                  BOB
                        You going to use your own name?

                                  CATES
                        Shit, no.

                                  CANDY

              He begins signing the documents.

                                  BOB
                        Jack, just remember one thing. If
                        all this comes down, you don't
                        know me.  I'm not gonna burn for
                        you.  And I'll tell you something
                        else.  If it all comes down, your
                        ass is new-mown grass.

                                  CATES
                        Right.  Hey, no sweat.

              He hands over the papers. Smiles.

                                  BOB
                        BOB You got him for 48 hours.

              Bob studies the sheet.

                                  BOB
                               (continuing)
                        You got a big career as a forger
                        if you decide to go that way,
                        Jack...   I'll ring security.

              TRANSITION.

              PROCESS ROOM - PRISON - DAY

              The GUARD leads Hammond to a steel cage. Harmnond's now
              wearing a beautifully tailored plaid suit.

              The Guard shouts to ANOTHER GUARD on the far side.







                                  GUARD
                        Prisoner G21355 ... Hammond.

                                  SECOND GUARD
                        Okay.  Send him through.

              The gate slides open. The Guard geztures for Hairmond to
              enter. Hammond walks to the far side of the pen.  The first
              gate closes, the second one opens.

              Hammond turns and walks over to Cates. The Guard comes up to
              Cates, double checks his orders then unlocks Hammond's cuffs.

                                  GUARD
                        Gotta sign for him.

                                  CATES
                        Sure thing...

              He looks over at Hammond who smiles at him.  Then looks at
              Harmond's clothes...

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        This prison gives out $400 suits?

                                  HAMMOND
                        What are you talkin' about?  This
                        suit's mine.  It cost $900.

              Hammond dusts off a sleeve.

                                  CATES
                        We're supposed to be after a
                        killer, not a string of hookers...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Listen, it may be a little out of
                        date. You know, I got a reputation
                        for lookingreal sharp with the
                        ladies...

              Cates hands some papers to the Guard.

                                  GUARD
                        He's all yours.

              The Guard walks away as Hammond feels Cates' lapel.

                                  HAMMOND
                        We could change this for something
                        good...Get you lookin' sharp for
                        pussy.

              Cates gives him a look.







                                  CATES
                        I don't need to hear your jive. I
                        already got that department taken
                        care of...

                                  HAMMOND
                        You got a girl... shit... the
                        generosityof women never ceases to
                        amaze me.

              Cates slaps a cuff on Hammond's outstrethand, then puts the
              other on his own wrist.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, no way.  Take off the
                        bracelets or no deal.

                                  CATES
                        You just don't get it, do your
                        Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I
                        own your ass.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No way to start a partnership.

                                  CATES
                        Get this.  We ain't partners. We
                        ain't brothers.  We ain't friends.
                        I'm puttin' you down and keepin'
                        you down until Ganz is locked up
                        or dead.  And if Ganz gets away,
                        you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Shit.  I'm already sorry.

              Cates yanks on the cuffs.  They move away.

                                  ?
                        TRANSITION.

              OUTSIDE THE JAIL - DAY



              CATES LEADS HAMMOND OUT.  THEY HEAD FOR CATES' BATTERED
              CADILLAC.

                                  HAMMOND
                        This your car, man?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.








                                  HAMMOND
                        It looks like you bought it off
                        one of the brothers.

              As they approach the car...

                                  CATES
                        Okay, let's get down to it.  I did
                        my part and got you out.  So now
                        you tell me where we're goin'?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Don't worry, I got a move for ya.
                        An awesome move. A guy named
                        Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a
                        visit.  We go to him right away.

                                  CATES
                        Luther was part of the gang?

                                  HAMMOND
                        What gang you talkin' about, Jack?

                                  CATES
                        I can read a police file,
                        shithead, and quit calling me Jack.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Just an expression man, don't mean
                        nothin'.

              Cates gets behind the wheel and kicks the engine over.

                                  CATES
                        I don't give a damn.  It happens
                        to be my name.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Then what're you complainin'
                        about? At least nobody's calling
                        you shithead....

                                  CATES
                        I may call you worse than that.

              Cates drives off.

              EXT. STREET - MISSION DISTRICT - DAY

              Cates' Cadillac purrs into view, entering a deserted street
              within a rundown neighborhood.

              INT. CADDY

              Hammond seated next to Cates.







                                  HAMMOND
                        Just up the street, the other
                        side, over there ... Now, don't
                        bother knockin' on the door.
                        Luther ain't the kind of guy that
                        looks for company.

                                  CATES
                        Your pal nuts enough to take a
                        shot at me?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Luther ain't the reliable type. I
                        don't want you shot yet, Cates ...
                        not before you been a help to me.

                                  CATES
                        I'm helpin' you, huh?

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah. Didn't you know that?

              STREET

              The Caddy pulls to a stop.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Over there...232...

              Cates double-checks his .38.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        You better let me borrow one of
                        those.

              Cates smiles.

                                  CATES
                        Sure thing, asshole.

              Handcuffs Hammond to the door handle.  Grabs the car keys.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You just hang on.  And hope this
                        big move of yours turns out to be
                        something. Opens the car door.



                                  CATES
                               (continuing)







              LUTHER'S VICTORIAN

              Cates knocks at the door. Nothing. Knocks again ... no
              response.. From inside, he hears a faint noise but no
              response to the knock. Holding the .38 in one hand, Cates
              tries the knob with the other. The door opens. Cautiously,
              Cates steps inside.

              INT. LUTHER'S VICTORIAN

              Long corridor ahead. No sign of Luther.

              CATES

              Moves down the corriaor, checks the rooms off to one sides.

              LUTHER LUTHER

              slips into the hallway behind Cates... Cates turns just as he
              gets to the kitchen. Luther holds a gun. Cates drops to a
              crouch and aims the .38. Luther whirls and fires at Cates. As
              wood and plaster fly out all round him, Cates makes a running
              dive for the floor. Luther runs out before Cates has
              regainehis feet.

              STREET

              Luther rushes out the front door and heads toward the
              Cadillac.

              HAMMOND

              Watches as Luther heads down the sidewaltoward him. As he
              starts to pass by... Hammond steps out suddenly... Flattens
              him with the car door. Luther drops, stunned. Hammond, still
              restricted by being cuffed to the door handle, reaches and
              grabs his pistol.

                                  CATES
                        Hammond, Drop the Goddamn gun.

              Hammond looks up. He sprints across the pavement. Aims his
              gun at Hammond.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Quit playin' cop and undo this
                        cuff, Jack, I need to talk to this
                        man.

                                  CATES
                        I'm tellin' you to drop the Goddam
                        gun.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I got a whole thing about people
                        pointin' guns at me.






                                  CATES
                        Just throw me the Goddamn gun.

              Long moment. Then Hammond smiles and tosses him Luther's
              pistol.  Luther groans. Cates puts his foot on Luther's belly
              and pulls himself into a standing position, cuffs him.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Luther, I always told you the
                        physical side of life wasn't your
                        gig.  Look at you, all messed
                        up... Course you never were much
                        in the snappy dresser department,
                        were you?

              Cates now has Luther ready to be questioned.

                                  CATES
                        Come on, talk to him.

              Hammond turns to smile at Luther.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What's happening, Luther?

                                  LUTHER
                        I thought you were inside...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Meet my travel Agent.

              Luther leans forward, looks straight at Cates.

                                  LUTHER
                        A cop...

                                  CATES
                        I sure ain't his fairy
                        godmother... now I'm looking for
                        Ganz...where is he?

                                  LUTHER
                        Haven't seen him for years. That's
                        the truth.

                                  CATES
                        You just took a shot at me,
                        asshole. I think you do know where
                        he is.

                                  LUTHER
                        Who gives a fuck what you think?

              Cates grabs the still open Cadillac door, slams it into
              Luther. He falls backwards. Cates looks at Hammond.







                                  CATES
                        Hey, this works pretty good.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Thank you.

                                  CATES
                        Want to try it again?

              Luther sits up again, glares at Cates.

                                  LUTHER
                        Ganz and Billy got my girl,
                        Rosalie.

                                  CATES
                        I think I met her.  Now tell us
                        something we don't know, like
                        where they stashed her.

                                  LUTHER
                        I don't know.

              Cates slams the car door agains him again.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I gotta tell you he's having a
                        ball with this car door, Luther...
                        You'd better think of somethin' to
                        tell him.

              Luther besitates...flashes a look at Hammond, who sends him
              a silent fleeting reply.  Maybe Cates sees this. Maybe not.

                                  LUTHER
                        He ... he wants me to help him
                        skip town.

                                  CATES
                        When? How?

                                  LUTHER
                        I dunno ... he's gonna call me...

              Another look at Hammond.

                                  LUTHER
                               (continuing)
                        He's gonna call me on...Tuesday.

              Something's wrong with all this.  Cates isn't sure just what.
              Not yet. He looks at Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        What do you think?







                                  HAMMOND
                        I think you better put him on ice,
                        man.

                                  CATES
                        He's gotta take that call ... if
                        there is one.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If you let him run around till
                        Tuesday, he's gonna run right to
                        Ganz and warn him. Ain't you,
                        motherfucker?

              Luther makes a play toward Hammond, who laughs, doesn't even
              flinch.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Luther, are you angry with me?

              Cates wrestles Luther into the back seat, turns to Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        I don't know what the hell you're
                        smiling about, watermelon. Your
                        big move turned out to be shit.

              HAMMOND Just stares at Cates, keeps smiling...

              TRANSITION.

              BOOKING - POLICE PRECINCT - NIGHT

              Two Uniforms follow a sullen Luther, Cates and Hammond to the
              DUTY SERGEANT... Cates speaks to him through the small
              window.

                                  CATES
                        Assault on a police officer with
                        a deadly weapon.  Carrying a
                        concealed weapon.  Resisting
                        arrest, Disturbing the peace.
                        Public nuisance...

              The Sergeant begins typing out an arrest form.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        I'll think up a few more and file
                        the report tomorrow.

              Cates looks back at Hammond as Luther is hauled away.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Come on, I gotta make a phone call.





              As they move through the honeycomb of office partitions.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You stay with me.

              Cates picks up the phone on the other side of the booking
              desk. Dials ... waits for a response as TWO HOOKERS are led
              past by an Arresting Officer. Hammond gives them the eye.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        This is Jack Cates. Any messages?

              ELAINE'S APARTMENT

              Elaine is on the kitchen phone, speakingwhite putting her
              coat on over her uniform for the evening.  One look at the
              way it is cut and you know why she hates her job.

                                  ELAINE
                        Just one.  Some lady called.  Said
                        she's a little hot-headed
                        sometimes... But she still wants
                        her occasional roommate. She'd
                        like to talk it over after she
                        gets off work tonight... if it's
                        humanly possible....

                                  CATES
                        Elaine, look, I'm in the middle of
                        sone stuff right now... I'm not
                        gonna have time to come by. I
                        don't know when I can get there.

              Her face falls. Making the offer was hard enough.

                                  ELAINE
                        Come on, Jack ... you're making me
                        work too Goddamn hard at this...

              Jack is very irritated by this turn of events.

                                  CATES
                        Listen, Goddamn it if you think
                        I'm happy about it, you're nuts.
                        I just gotta take care of a few
                        things, okay?

                                  ELAINE
                        This is not the way people who
                        care for each other are supposed
                        to behave.

              Cates says nothing.  She hangs up angrily.







              BOOKING

              Hammond is working on the girls.

                                  HAMMOND

                        So where do you want to do it,
                        honey? You wanna hop up on the
                        counter?

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, we can go to the back room.

              Cates walks over and pulls him by the shoulder.

                                  CATES
                        We're on the move. Let's go. As
                        they walk toward a corridor.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Do you know how close I was to
                        getting some trim.  And you
                        fucked' it up.








                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you.
                        And I didn't get you out so you
                        could go on a Goddamn "trim"
                        hunt... stop moaning.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Speakin' of moans my Stomach is
                        startin' to growl.

                                  CATES
                        We eat when I say we eat.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Bullshit ... I ain't moving  till
                        I get something to eat. You've
                        been treating me like shit ever
                        since I came out here.  If you
                        don't like it, you can take me
                        back to the penitentiary and kiss
                        my hungry black ass good-bye.  And
                        I want some food some place nice..
                        Some good people, nice music...

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, I'm hungry too. I know of a
                        place. Let's go eat.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, I want mandolins, flowers...
                        They move off down the corridor.

              TRANSITION.

              UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - NIGHT

              INT.  POLICE HEADQUARTERS

              Cates and Hammond at a candy machine.  Cates drops in a
              quarter, throws Hammond a candy bar...

                                  CATES
                        There's your God-damn dinner. Now,
                        let's go.

              They move toward a row of parked cars.

              AT THE CADDY

                                  HAMMOND
                        Who'd you call on the phone back
                        at the booking station?

                                  CATES
                        Just get in the car and keep your
                        mouth shut.






              Hammond gets in the car as Cates readjusts Elaine's scarf on
              the mirror.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Must of been your lady friend...

              Cates frowns at him.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        You really do have onoe, huh,
                        Jack... what's her problem besides
                        you?

                                  CATES
                        She's got the same complaint as
                        half the Goddamn population.  She
                        can't get the job she's trained
                        for and it pisses her off...
                        Anyway, what the fuck do you care?

              Cates climbs in behind the wheel of the Cadillac.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, man, tell me about her.  In
                        jail they got me surrounded by
                        guys wearin' blue suits twenty-
                        four hours a day.  And I ain't
                        built for that. Really?  With the
                        clothes you got on you look like
                        you'd love it.

              Cates takes a belt from his flask.

                                  CATES
                        Now, where we goin', convict?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Mission District.  Gonna find us
                        an Indian.

              Cates starts the motor, slams it into gear.  Accelerates out
              to the street.

              TRANSITION.

              EXT.  CITY STREET NIGHT

              Cates and Hammon booming along in the Caddy.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Come on, Jack.  I want to hear
                        about your girl.  When were you
                        with her last ... You get what I
                        mean?

              Smiles. Cates smiles back at him, almost cruelly





                                  CATES
                        I don't give out the details.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Last night, two nights ago, three?

              Cates keeps smiling.

                                  CATES
                        Last night.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You have a good time?

              Pained expression on Cates' face as he comes back to reality.

                                  CATES
                        Sure.  Then we had a fight this
                        morning.

                                  HAMMOND
                        At least you took care of business
                        and got the important part in
                        before she came down on you...Tell
                        me a little about her.  She got
                        great tits?

              Cates gives him a hard look.

                                  CATES
                        I get the feeling it's going to be
                        real long night.

              They keep driving.

              TRANSITION.

              MISSION DISTRICT - STREET - NIGHT

              The Cadillac drives slowly past a bar called Torchie's.
              Stops at the end of the block.

                                  CATES
                        Well?

                                  HAMMOND
                        It's a long shot, but...Billy used
                        to tend bar here a few years back.
                        I heard him talk about it.

                                  CATES
                        This part of town, they'll make us
                        for heat the second we walk in.
                        Just back me up like you've got a
                        piece...







                                  HAMMOND
                        Back you up?  Now why would I
                        wanna do that?

                                  CATES
                        If they kick my ass, they'll sure
                        as hell carve yours up...

                                  HAMMOND
                        But you can handle it all right,
                        huh? Real amazin' how far a gun
                        and a badge can carry some cats...

                                  CATES
                        Bullshit.  Attitude and experience
                        get you through...

              Cates and Hammond step out, glance toward the bar.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I been in a lot of bars where a
                        white cop rousted me and some of
                        the brothers. All those clowns
                        ever had going for 'em was a gun
                        and a badge...

                                  CATES
                        You need five years training to
                        handle a joint like...

              Hamnond's had enough of this debate.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, you wanna bet?

                                  CATES
                        I got two problems.  Number one,
                        I'm not playin' games.  Number
                        two, you got nothin' to bet with.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If we come outta this joint with
                        Ganz' phone number, or a dead
                        Indian, or anything else useful,
                        then you could turn the other way
                        for half an hour while I get
                        laid...

                                  CATES
                        Why?  Anybody that talks about
                        women as much as you do probably
                        can't get it up anyway.

                                  HAMMOND
                        That's never been one of my
                        problems.







                        Now, stop stallin', man, or else
                        admit all this professional stuff
                        you're talkin' about is a crock of
                        shit.

                                  CATES
                        I'll tell you what happens if you
                        lose... you tell the truth for
                        once.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What are you talkin' about?

                                  CATES
                        You tell me what Ganz busted out
                        for, he's after a lot more than
                        just gettin' out of jail.  And
                        whatever it is, you're part of it.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I don't know what you're talking
                        about. I just wanna see Ganz
                        nailed.

                                  CATES
                        The bet's off.

              Hammond thinks it over..

                                  HAMMOND
                        Okay, if I lose, I'll tell you
                        anything you want to know...

              Cates reaches into his pocket.

                                  CATES
                        I'm gonna enjoy this ... here,
                        I'll even loan you my badge.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I thought you said bullshit and
                        experience are all it takes.

              He takes the badge anyway as they head for the entrance.

              TORCHIE'S WESTERN BAR

              They step inside. Hammond reacts to...

              REDNECK CITY

              Longhorns mounted over the bar, Rebel Flags, Lone Star Beer,
              armadillo posters. Even the waitresses wear Stetsons.
              Rockabilly pounding from the jukebox. A Cowgirl Stripper is
              doing the grind on a small podium.






                                  HAMMOND
                        This place don't seem real popular
                        with the brothers.

                                  CATES
                        My kind of place. I always liked
                        country boys.

              Cates smiles, finds a table in the corner. A Cowgirl comes
              over to take his order.

              HAMMOND

              Takes a deep breath, moves toward the bar. Smiles at the good
              ol' boys. They don't smile back. He sits down at the bar.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Yeah.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Vodka.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Maybe you better have a Black
                        Russian.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, man, I think I'll have a vodka.

              Hamnond looks around the room.

              THE BARTENDER

              places a glass in front of him, picks up the dollar as
              Harmond flashes Cates' shield.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You know a big Indian named Billy
                        Bear?  He used to work here.

              The Bartender shakes his head, gives him a scowl.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Never heard of him.

              Hammond lifts the shot glass and throws it through the mirror
              behind the bar. Sudden silence throughout the room.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Now how's your memory doin'?



                                  BARTENDER
                        Fuck off.  I don't know what the
                        hell you're talkin' about.






                                  HAMMOND
                        Maybe I better ask around, see
                        what your pals think.

                                  BARTENDER
                        I don't give a shit who you ask.

              The Bartender walks down toward Cates.

              HAMMOND

              Moves away from the bar. He stops at a booth occupied by

              FOUR COWBOY PUNKS,

              one a very big man.  Hammond grabs him by the arm and pulls
              him up.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Up against the wall, cowboy.

              The Punk breaks free, aims a massive haymaker at Hammond.
              Gets a right to the stomach for his trouble.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Now, I said get over there by that
                        wall ... You hear me,
                        motherfucker...

              Looks at the others.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Move it, rednecks.  On your feet...

              He grabs the next by the arm, yanks him up.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Over there...move your ass. Some
                        of you rednecks seem a little hard
                        of hearing, so I'll repeat it for
                        everybody... I need word on the
                        whereabouts of an Indian that goes
                        by the name of Billy Bear. It's a
                        police matter and you all look
                        like you'd just love to
                        cooperate...

              CATES Quietly sips his beer. The other occupants of the bar
              watch Hammond herd the four Punks to the end wall.

              A BIG COWBOY

              when Hammond isn't looking, he dashes toward the exit, Cates
              puts out a leg. Sends the Cowboy crashing into a crowdedtable.





              HAMMOND

              Turns around at the noise.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        That wasn't necessary, buddy. I
                        got this under control.

                                  CATES
                        Some of us citizens are with you
                        all the way, Officer.

              The Redneck Punks are now spread-eagled against the wall.
              Hammond searches the first. He drops a wallet on the floor
              and moves to the second. A switchblade, some credit cards and
              another wallet fall to the floor. The last Punk has only a
              roll of bills.  Hammond holds the money up to his face.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You're in trouble, big trouble, so
                        you better start talking. Where'd
                        a boy like you make a score like
                        this?

                                  PUNK
                        It's mine, what the hell...

                                  HAMMOND
                        You must a rolled somebody.  They
                        don't let punks like you take jobs
                        that pay this much ... you sure
                        you don't know a dangerous Indian,
                        because unless you start talkin'
                        I may just have to start looking
                        down your pants with a
                        flashlight...

                                  PUNK
                        What kind of cop are you, anyway?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I am your most terrible nightmare
                        ... a bad nigger with a badge that
                        entitles him to kick your ass...

              Hammond turns to the Bartender...

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        One of them is under-age.  Another
                        attacked a police officer. And you
                        know I ain't found what I came
                        lookin' here for yet...

              Walks back to the Bartender.






                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        The tall one had a weapon ... you
                        want me to keep on makin' a list,
                        or you got the picture yet?

              He reaches for a towel under a pyramid of bar glasses. Jerks
              the towel, the pyramid capsizes onto the floor. Huge crash as
              the glasses break into a million fragments.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Looks like you're on your way to
                        bein' outta business, redneck...
                        Now, let's see what can we fuck
                        with next?

              The Bartender doesn't have the look of a happy man.

                                  BARTENDER
                        Okay, okay.  The Indian hangs out
                        with a girl down the block. Right
                        where Chinatown starts.  She lives
                        on top of the hardware store.

              Hammond turns, grins at Cates. As far as he's concerned, he's
              won the bet.  Cates nods, slips out the door.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I don't give a damn about his
                        girl...

                                  BARTENDER
                        Look, give me a break, you're
                        going to have to settle for her
                        place.  It's the only thing I know.

              He looks desperate.

                                  BARTENDER
                               (continuing)
                        I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all
                        I know.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Try obeyin' the law once in
                        awhile, and I won't have to hassle
                        you...

              Turns to go, then turns back.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        But remember this, cowboy, there's
                        a new sheriff in town.

              Smiles, turns and goes.





              TRANSITION.

              STREET - ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT

              Hammond steps out of the bar.  He crosses to Cates by the car.

                                  CATES
                        I think you got something for me.

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        The gun you took off that redneck
                        in there.

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You made that move, huh?

                                  CATES
                        While you're at it, You can give
                        me the switchblade, too.

              Hammond reluctantly takes out a .22 automatic, slams it down
              on the hood of the car.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Credit cards?

              Hammond hands them over with the knife.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You already got a gun and you owe
                        me a piece of ass.  I'll settle
                        for the gun you just took.

              A long moment. Then Cates slowly lifts the .22 automatic.

                                  CATES
                        You did a real good job... Guess
                        you deserve a reward.

              Removes the clip.  Throws it across the street. Hands Hammond
              the automatic.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Motherfucker.

              He throws the gun away.

                                  CATES
                        I sure am. Now let's go get us an
                        Indian.






              They walk up the block.

              TRANSITION.

              STREET - CHINATOWN - NIGHT

              Neon signs with Sino lettering.

              CATES AND HAMMOND

              Walk down the street, spot a shop with a window display of
              tools.  Look up at the darkened apartment windows. They walk
              to the end of the block.

              ALLEY

              Stairwells lead to each apartment above the shops. Cates and
              Hammond move along the buildings... Arrive at the back of the
              hardware store. Quietly, they start to ascend the stairs.

              STAIRWELL

              The metal steps extend onto a platform by the back door.
              Cates leans over the railings to look through the adjacent
              window. Between the drawn curtains, a flickering glimmer from
              a TV set. On the tube, various poses from stridently
              exercising women.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What the shit is that?

              Looks again. A female form passes by, goes out of the room.

                                  CATES
                        There.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Must be billy's girl.

                                  CATES
                        Come on.

              DOORWAY

              Cates gestures to the door lock. Hammond fiddles with it for
              several moments. The door swings open. They step into a
              darkened room.

              APARTMENT

              Cates takes the .38 from his pocket. He stops near the open
              bedroom doorway. He looks at Hammond and then both men step
              quickly into the room.

                                  CATES
                        Police! Nobody move!






              Hammond reaches for the light switch. Takes a heavy blow.
              Slumps against the door. A Woman's voice screams out.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Stay where you are!

              The light goes on. Cates' gun points at a YOUNG WOMAN (CASEY)
              in a flimsy dressing gown. Saturday Night Special held
              between her palms, police style... A SECOND WOMAN (SALLY)
              stands beside Hammond at the light switch. Larger and
              slightly older than the first, she wears a man's shirt. Holds
              a baseball bat in her right hand.

                                  SALLY
                        You better drop it or he's gonna
                        get another one.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, talk to here jack.  I don't
                        feel like gettin' number two along
                        side of the head.

                                  CATES
                        I said police.  Now drop the
                        goddamn gun.

                                  CASEY
                        Don't give me that police shit.
                        You drop it.

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                        Okay, look, don't shoot.  I'm just
                        reachin' for my badge.

              Cates takes out his badge-Shows it to Casey.

                                  CASEY
                        I don't like this bullshit. I've
                        seen fake badges before.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'll tell you something lady, this
                        guy is a real nervous cop - He's
                        just liable to pull the trigger.

              Cates takes two steps toward Casey...

                                  CATES
                        Naw, I'm the calm type.  I know
                        you don't want me to shoot you,
                        and I know that you don't want to
                        shoot me.

              He takes two more steps toward her.





                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Shooting a cop puts you away for
                        a long time.

              Holds out his hand.

                                  CASEY
                        You assholes better be real.

              She hands Cates the gun. Sally prods Hammond with the
              baseball bat.

                                  SALLY
                        Just wait a Goddamn second here,
                        let's see your badge...

              He snatches the bat out of her hands.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Don't have one.

                                  SALLY
                        I knew it.  Call the cops.

              Casey walks over to the phone.

                                  CATES
                        Tell them it's Cates, Detective
                        31st District.  Then put your
                        clothes on. If you don't answer
                        some questions I'm taking both
                        your asses in.

              After a moment, Casey puts down the phone.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Now, let's cut out the crap, which
                        one of you sees Billy Bear?

                                  SALLY
                        None of your business, cop.  The
                        son of a bitch isn't here, and he
                        isn't coming back.

                                  CATES
                        You can do better than that.

              Turns to Casey.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        How about it?








                                  CASEY
                        I used to go with him...I don't
                        know where the hell he is.  I
                        haven't seen him for two weeks.
                        And I don't think I will.  He owes
                        me money...

                                  SALLY
                        He's a Goddamn lowlife, the way he
                        treated her.

                                  CATES
                        Sounds like a real stormy romance.

                                  CASEY
                        I don't much care what it sounds
                        like to you, Cop. All I know is
                        that I went a few laps around the
                        track with him and I ended up with
                        nothin' but the short end of the
                        stick.

              Cates looks over at Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        Let's go.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Wait a minute.  Maybe these ladies
                        would like to go a few laps with
                        us.  How about it? I been nearly
                        three years in prison and...

                                  SALLY
                        Fuck off.

                                  CATES
                        Come on...

              Hannond starts for the door with Cates.

                                  CASEY
                        If you find that bastard, Billy,
                        tell him to stay out of my life.
                        I don't need any more of his macho
                        bullshit.

              TRANSITION.

              STREET  CHINATOWN - NIGHT

              The two men walk among the bright neon lights. Neither of
              them very happy.









                                  CATES
                        This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of
                        my gun and goes all over the
                        streets killing people with it.
                        So, instead of me being where I
                        oughta be, which is in bed giving
                        my girl the high, hard one, I'm
                        out here doing this shit, roaming
                        around with some overdressed,
                        charcoal-colored loser like you.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You wanna leave, man?  Let me take
                        care of Ganz all by myself.

                                  CATES
                        You?  Don't make me laugh.  You
                        can't take care of shit.  You've
                        been dicking me around since we
                        started on this turd-hunt.  All
                        you're good for is games... So
                        far, what I got outta you is
                        nothin'...

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm impressed with you too, Jack
                        you did a real good job of busting
                        up a couple of dykes bedded down
                        for the night.

                                  CATES
                        Luther knew more than he told me
                        and so do you...Now you better
                        tell we what the fuck this is all
                        about.  I gave you 48 hours to
                        come up with something and the
                        clock's runnin' ...

              A long look at Hammond.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Maybe I don't like the way you ask.

                                  CATES
                        Who gives a Goddamn what you
                        think? You're just a crook that's
                        got a weekendpass ... You're not
                        even a name anymore. Just a spear-
                        chucker with a Goddamn number
                        stenciled on the back of his
                        prison fatigues...

              They walk past.

              TRANSITION.







              STREET ACROSS FROM TORCHIE'S - NIGHT

              They two men walk toward the Cadillac.

                                  CATES
                        Okay, Reggie, I'm done playing
                        around. I want to know what's
                        going on and I'm going to beat the
                        living shit out of you until you
                        tell me.

              Hammond goes into a street rap.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You beat the shit out of me?
                        Don't make me laugh, sucker.  You
                        don't know how I'd dance on your
                        face?  I'll hit you so hard, so
                        many times, you'll wish you'd
                        never been hatched.  I'll turn
                        your face into cottage cheese.
                        I'll make your girl think you been
                        takin' ugly pills.  She won't even
                        know who you are, sucker.

              They stop by the car. Cates takes the gun out, lays it on the
              hood.  Hammond stares at him. Cates next takes out his
              wallet, shows Hammond his badge, then lays the badge on the
              car fender... Smiles.

                                  CATES
                        I guess the first thing I ought,
                        to explain to you, nigger, is I
                        fight dirty.

              Hits Hammond a tremendous right hand full in the face.
              Hammond sags, grabs onto the car fender for support. Cates
              hesitates ... and Hammond kicks out, sending the partially
              open car door slamming into Cates. Cates sprawls.

                                  HAMMOND
                        So do I.

              Hammond aims a kick at Cates' head.  Cates blocks it with
              crossed forearms, grabs, twists.  Hammond tumbles, rolls away
              from Cates.  Both men struggle to their feet, circle each
              other.

              Hammond moves in only to receive twoquick blows from Cates,
              a bit sooner than he expected.  Cates smiles.

              Hammond dances in and out... Cates' breathing becomes more
              labored. His windmill attack penetrates Cates' defense. Cates
              clears his head, charges, bull-like ... His rush and greater
              bulk send both of them crashing into some trash cans and a
              brick wall.






              Hammond is faster...

              Cates is much stronger; Both men on their knees. They look at
              one another. Silently, they move to their feet. Hammond's
              back is to a wall... Cates keeps him there, negates the
              lighter man's agility. They slug away, each now arm-weary...
              Exchange a dozen blows. Finally, Cates steps back, arms at
              his side... Breath coming like a bellows...

              Hammond has to hold on to the wall; one more punch would put
              him out.

                                  CATES
                        Now, you bastard, you going to
                        tell me what's going on...

              Puffing away.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        ... Do I have to kick the shit out
                        of you some more.

              They stand facing one another. Hammond smiles. A black-and-
              white comes roaring up the street. Sirens howling, red lights
              flashing, it slides to a stop. TWO UNIFORMED COPS jump out,
              guns drawn.

                                  FIRST COP
                        All right, you two.  Don't move.

                                  CATES
                        NO, no...it's okay...I'm police.

                                  SECOND COP
                        Yeah, sure.  Get your hands above
                        your head.

              He keeps his gun trained on Cates,and Hammond.

                                  CATES
                        My gun and badge are over there.
                        And I'm too fucking tired to raise
                        my hands...

              Hammond rubs the side of his face. Cates falls back against
              the patrol car. Still fighting for breath. The First Cop
              lifts Cates' wallet off the Cadillac and looks at his badge,
              shows it to the other cop.

                                  FIRST COP
                        What the hell's going on here?

              Cates walks over, pockets his gun.








                                  SECOND COP
                        I've got a burglary call.  Two
                        women say a couple of hoods broke
                        into their place posing as cops.

                                  CATES
                        I was following a lead.  We
                        rousted them... Go up and sweet
                        talk 'em.  You can straighten it
                        out.

              The First Cop checks out Cates' badge and I.D.

                                  FIRST COP
                        Why don't you do it?  We got
                        better things to do than
                        straighten out your messes.

                                  CATES
                        So do I. I'll file a report
                        tomorrow.

              The First Cop takes out his book, starts writing.  He's
              pissed.

                                  FIRST COP
                        I gotta file a..Report tonight
                        asshole...

                                  CATES
                        Goes with the territory.

              He grabs Hammond and they head for the Cadillac.

              TRANSITION.

              ALL-NIGHT GAS STATION

              Cadillac parked behind the service area.

              RESTROOM

              Hammond looks' up at his bruised face in the mirror, then
              washes up.  Cates is one step ahead of him. He rolls up a
              piece of the wet towel and inserts it over his bleeding gum.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Too bad we got interrupted when we
                        did.  I was getting ready to
                        finish you off.

              Cates straightens up from the wash basin.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, right.  You want to try
                        again?






                                  HAMMOND
                        Naw, you'd just call your pals
                        back to bail you out one more time.

                                  CATES
                        They saved your ass, convict.

                                  HAMMOND
                        One thing's for sure, Jack.
                        That's how you'll tell the story.

              Cates dries off his face, starts out of the washroom.

                                  CATES
                        I'll even put it in my report that
                        way.

              The door closes behind Cates. Hammond leans back toward the
              mirror, nudges a tooth with his finger.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Motherfucker.

              GAS STATION PARKING LOT

              Cates leans on the Cadillac as Hammond emerges. Hammond
              starts for the passenger side.

                                  CATES
                        Wait a minute.

              Hammond stops.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You come clean or we're going to
                        go again.  Right here, right now.

              Pause.

              A long moment; Hammond decides be has no choice.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I been waiting a long time for
                        some money.

                                  CATES
                        How much?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Half a million.

                                  CATES
                        Jesus.

              Hammond smiles his meanest smile.






                                  HAMMOND
                        How's that for a number to give
                        you heart failure? Guess you might
                        start to get the picture after
                        all. Mlaybe you're on the wrong
                        side of the old law and order
                        business..

              Cates is unmoved.

                                  CATES
                        Just tell me about the money.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Me and my bunch hit a dealer in
                        the middle of a sale. It's the
                        kind of money nobody ever reports
                        stolen. I was sittin' pretty,
                        livin' in the high cotton, then
                        somebody fingered me for another
                        job. ... Some psycho who's out
                        there capping people with some
                        cop's gun.

                                  CATES
                        He's after your money.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You catch on real fast...Okay,
                        Jack, let's talk deal. How much of
                        my money you gonna let me keep?

              Cates just looks at him.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        We split 50-50?

                                  CATES
                        Not likely, convict.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You gonna let me keep any of it?

                                  CATES
                        Depends on how things work out. I
                        believe in the merit system. So
                        far you haven't built up any
                        points.

              He smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Okay, from now on, I'm gonna be
                        real good, Jack.

              Cates smiles back.





                                  CATES
                        Where's the money?

                                  HAMMOND
                        In the trunk of a car.  A lot
                        better than under a mattress,
                        right?

              Cates smiles.

                                  CATES
                        Right, partner.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Get this. We ain't partners. We
                        ain't brothers. We ain't friends.
                        If Ganz gets away with my money,
                        you're gonna be sorry we ever met.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah.  Right.

              They get into the Caddy. Boom away.

              TRANSITION.

              The Cadillac moving through the city... Clock on the
              dashboard showing 4 a.m. Cates at the wheel.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Where's the goddamn car?

                                  HAMMOND
                        You're a real case, you know that,
                        Jack?

              Smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        This'll show you how smart I am.
                        I got it parked.

                                  CATES
                        ...For three years?  Let's hope it
                        wasn't a tow-away zone.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You just drove by it.

              The Cadillac makes a screeching U-turn,i swings into the curb.

              Cates leans out, looks at...








              PARKING BUILDING

              Narrow, multi-storied, with a garage-like opening and
              signals... proclaiming 'Weekly-Monthly-Long Term."

              CADILLAC

                                  CATES
                        Okay, now what?

              Hammond gets out of the car.

              Stands on the sidewalk.

              Stretches.

              Then gets into the back seats.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Since you're wired on benniest you
                        get to stay up and stare at the
                        building. I'm  tired, so I'm going
                        to sleep. They take Sunday off.
                        Place opens at seven o'clock
                        Monday morning. Wake me up at a
                        quarter till...

              Cates stares at the place.

                                  CATES
                        You son of a bitch. You knew where
                        the money was all along and all we
                        had to do was come here and wait.
                        I almost got my ass blown off
                        twice tonight for nothing.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I wasn't sure the money was still
                        there until we saw Luther. You
                        almost got your ass shot off for
                        nothing once, not twice, Jack.

                                  CATES
                        Shit.

              THE CITY

              Beyond the skyline, grey streaks of dawn etch the sky.

              TRANSITION.

              The Cadillac is pulled up facing the streets down the block
              from the parking sections Cates walks in through the lot
              entrance. Threads his way between the lines of parked
              vehicles Tired and haggard, he carries a paper bag filled
              with quick-order food.






              CADILLAC

              Hammond stretches on the back seat.  Cates slams the door
              shut.

                                  CATES
                        I don't want you sleeping on the
                        job.

              Hammond yawns, eases himself into a sitting position.

                                  HAMMOND
                        The place opens in five minutes.
                        Ganz ought to be here soon...

              Cates tears the paper bag open. Passes a cup of coffee and
              donut back. He sips his own coffee, adds some whiskey from
              his flask... pops another bennie.

                                  CATES
                        You took a big chance, leaving
                        this here all this time.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Not really.  I figured Ganz was
                        put down for a long time.  And I
                        knew Luther would never job me on
                        his own.  He's too chickenshit.

                                  CATES
                        Guess what?  Luther just got in
                        line.

              Hammond sits up.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What?

                                  CATES
                        Musta got some primo bondsman.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace
                        The guy pulls a gun on a cop and
                        he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you
                        some of the courts these days are
                        just a fucking revolving door.

              INT. PARKING LOT BUILDING

              Luther walks up to the window where a bored ATTENDANT reads
              a comic book.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        Yeah?







                                  LUTHER
                        I want to pick up my car.

              He passes across a faded form.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        Name?

                                  LUTHER
                        Hammond.

              The Attendant examines the form, surprised.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        This is three years old.

                                  LUTHER
                        Yeah, I've been busy.

              The Attendant opens a key file, begins rummaging in it.

                                  ATTENDANT
                        We don't wash 'em, ya know.

                                  LUTHER
                        How about chargin' the battery?

                                  ATTENDANT
                        That we do. And we put air in the
                        tires. I'll even sell you some gas
                        if you need it.

                                  LUTHER
                        Great, just great.

              The Attendant finds the key, exits the booth. Luther follows
              to an elevated stack of cars. The Attendant throws a switch,
              the stack of cars begins to move.

              STREET

              Luther drives down the exit ramp in a dated Porsche
              convertible.

              The car is covered with a uniform coat of dust, except for
              the windshield which has been wiped hastily clean.

              Luther waits for a break in the flow of traffic, drives out.

              Another street

              Luther turns onto a side street and then suddenly Cate's
              Cadillac appears ... starts to tail the Porsche.

              CADILLAC

              Cates follows Luther through several turns.





              The Porsche jerks whenever it speeds up or slows down.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Jesus Christ, look at all the dust
                        on my car...why in the hell don't
                        he take it to a car wash?

                                  CATES
                        Didn't know you darker people went
                        in for foreign jobs.

                        I let women get to me.  The quest

                        ... I got my own personal

                        separate from guns, money and
                        business ... women are for

              driveway of parking lot.

              LUTHER - CATES & HAMMOND'S P.O.V.

              He goes to the trunk. Rummages there ... picks up a flaming
              red suit.

              INT. CADILLAC

                                  CATES

                        That was in style a couple years

                        armed robbery to pimping, then
                        you're all set.

              Under the suit is a nondescript attache case. Luther takes
              it, closes the trunk. Beads down the sidewalk.

              CADILLAC

                                  HAMMOND
                        That's the money, Jack.

              They jump out of the car, follow on foot.








              STREET

              Luther hurries along the sidewalk.

              He reaches the corner, turns quickly...

              CATES AND HAMMOND

              Following a little way behind.

              They pause at the corner, watching the pedestrian traffic
              move by. Then turn down the cross street after Luther. Follow
              him down a stairwell.

              SUBWAY STATION - LOBBY

              Escalators and open stairwells. Luther enters and pauses by
              the doorway. Commuters crowd the counters and congregate near
              the stairwells. More people are seated along hard plastic
              seats. But no Ganz.  And no Billy.

              Luther moves further into the station.  Cates and Hammond
              enter. They keep Luther fixed between them, 50 feet ahead.
              Luther seems to be wandering He walks through the shop area
              and back toward the escalator. Hammond remains near the
              arcade while Cates blends in with the commuters. Luther puts
              the briefcase down at his feet and leans against a counter.
              Next to him, a loud troop of Boy Scouts marches by.  A crowd
              of people from the train area below flows through the lobby
              obscuring Luther from Hammond and Cates for a moment.  Cates
              steps out to get a better view and suddenly spots Ganz moving
              through the crowd toward Luther. Be looks over at Hammond
              across the station and motions.  Then they both start moving
              in on Ganz, trying to intercept him before he gets deeper
              into the crowd.

              Ganz moves cautiously through the station. A crumpled
              newspaper held absently in his hand. He scans the faces of
              the commuters and spots Luther. Fails to notice Cates and
              Hammond closing in on him from two directions.

              A PATROLMAN comes up. Starts chatting amiably with a Boy
              Scout next to Luther. Ganz hesitates in his approach. He
              motions Luther to move awaye, but Luther starts to panic when
              he sees Cates and Hammond closing in...

              Ganz reacts to Luther, turns and spots the two men. He makes
              an immediate break for open ground. The Patrolman sees Ganz
              start to run. The newspaper is thrown to the floor... Ganz
              swings Cates' .44 toward Hammond.

                                  PATROLMAN
                        Hey--you!

              Ganz whirls, his feet slipping on the marble floor. His shot
              at Hammond goes plowing into the ceiling. The crowd starts to
              panic and run in all directions.





              The Patrolman has al ready brought his own gun out. Levels it
              at Ganz.

                                  PATROLMAN
                               (continuing)
                        Put it down.

              BILLY BEAR

              Suddenly appears, Rosalie at his side. Billy Bear's .44
              blasts the Patrolman onto his back.

              Ganz comes up and scrambles through the screaming patrons.
              He, Billy and Rosalie head toward the escalator. Cates has
              already brought out his .38... Can't get a clean shot through
              the chaos.

              Hammond pushes his way through the crowd to Cates.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Shoot the sons of bitches.

              Cates can't risk it...

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        You don't want to chance it, then
                        give me the gun...

              A moment.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Bullshit. Then i'm staying with
                        the money.

                                  CATES
                        You stay with me...

                                  HAMMOND
                        No way...

              Hammond starts after Luther. Cates turns, starts to aim at
              Hammond. Hesitates...

              PASSENGER WALKWAY

              Panic has overtaken everyone as they try to escape the madman
              with the gun.

              Ganz and Billy elbow and kick their way through the crowd,
              tugging Rosalie along...

              Cates, gun in hand, creates further-panic as he moves after
              Ganz.

              Ganz grabs a man beside him.





              Shoves him hard into the passengers in back.

              The man knocks over several more people creating a roadblock.

              Ganz vaults over the railing and starts for the trains.
              Cates loses a few more precious seconds grappling through the
              terrorized passengers...

              TRAIN AREA

              The usually jammed area looks like an empty stockyard. The
              patrons huddle in fear against any available wall.

              Cates bursts out of the stairwell...

              TUNNEL

              Red and green signal lights. The light goes red, a train
              roars up and the doors hiss open.

              Billy and Ganz fight through the passengers getting off the
              train, jump on board; Billy pulls Rosalie behind him.

              CATES

              Running for the doors...

              Suddenly, a SECURITY OFFICER appears, riot gun in hand.

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                        Freeze!

                                  CATES
                        No! No!  There they are!

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                        Just put it down real slow.

              The train doors close.

                                  CATES
                        I'm a policeman, you asshole!

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                        Don't even try... now drop it
                        or - you're all done.

              He means it, points the riot gun even closer... The train in
              front of him moves away.

              Cates carefully places the .38 on the pavement. Then raises
              his hands in the air.

                                  CATES
                        Shit.

              Witnesses stand in nervous little knots. Give versions of
              what happened to notepad-toting patrolmen. Hospital
              Attendants minister to various and sundry complaints.

              Cates sits on a passenger bench, obviously dejected.  A
              voice comes echoing from behind.

                        Caught a train.

              Haden watches the Morgue Personnel wheel out the body of the
              Patrolman.

                                  HADEN
                        Which one pulled the trigger?

                                  CATES
                        The Indian.  I was about 30 yards
                        away.

                                  HADEN
                        You couldn't get to him?

              Cates shrugs.

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        What a screw-up.

                                  CATES
                        Right.  I screwed up.  I fucked
                        up. I messed up.  Anybody could
                        have done better, especially you.
                        I bet you're real good at hitting
                        targets through crowds.

              Haden starts toward the street. Looks back at Cates.







                                  HADEN
                        Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why
                        didn't you call in for backup
                        instead of makin' a grandstand
                        play?

                                  CATES
                        I didn't have the time.

                                  HADEN
                        Too bad, it would've covered your
                        ass.  Now you're in the shit and
                        so's the department. In case you
                        haven't noticed, this wasn't our
                        finest hour... I told you everyone
                        was watchin' on this one. Maybe
                        you better start thinkin' about
                        writin' tickets off a three wheel
                        bike.

              Cates looks at Haden for a moment...

              Turns and walks away.

              TRANSITION.

              PREDMORE HOTEL - NIGHT

              Hammond across the street from Predmore.

              Standing in a phone booth talking into the receiver...

              He turns and looks acain at the hotel...

              Hangs up.

              Walks into a nearby bar.

              TRANSITION.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB

              HAMMOND

              Punk Dancers all over the floor.

              A rock group blasting away...("NEW SHOES" - Vocal)

              HAMMOND

              At a back booth...

              A MAN (SOSNA) approaches carrying a small suitcase.

                                  HAMMOND
                        How you doing, man?






                                  SOSNA
                        Not bad, not bad.

              Puts the suitcase down on the table.

                                  SOSNA
                               (continuing)
                        You want to go outside?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Naw, right here's okay.

              Dancers sliding and jerking in front of them.

                                  SOSNA
                        You sure?

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm sure.  Everybody here's
                        looking at everybody else's ass.

              Sosna pops open the suitcase. Lid shielding the contents from
              the patrons...

                                  SOSNA
                        I got some real nice merchandise.
                        All of it's clean.

              Suitcase arranged like q salesman's display case. Tightly
              spaced rows of handguns mounted in their holsters.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I like this one...

              Pockets a revolver with a deft move.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        How about some ammo?

                                  SOSNA
                        It's loaded... I got some shells
                        in here.

              Opens another compartment. Hammond helps himself to two
              boxes...

                                  HAMMOND
                        How much?

                                  SOSNA
                        This is clean shit.  No serial
                        numbers and never been used...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Don't mess with me. How much?






                                  SOSNA
                        Five bills.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Five.  On credit.

                                  SOSNA
                        This ain't a credit business.

              You know that.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, I know that, but this is me
                        and we're old friends. I haven't
                        got the money so what are you
                        gonna do about it?

                                  SOSNA
                        Give it back.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Try and take it.

              A long moment.

                                  SOSNA
                        Fuck you.  You got no right for
                        this kind of play.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'll got your money to you. No
                        sweat.

              Hammonds heads for the bar.

              Stands next to a good-looking woman (RITA). Nods to the
              barkeep.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        Vodka. With a twist. And I want to
                        run a tab.

              Served up. He knocks half of it back, turns to the woman.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        My name's Reggie Hammond.

              Big personality smile.

                                  RITA
                        So what?

              She turns away as he takes a drink. He looks at another
              pretty girl (ANGELA).






                                  HAMMOND
                        Hi there. I'm Reggie Hammond.

                                  ANGELA
                        I'm with somebody.

              She turns away.

                                  HAMMOND
                        This ain't my night.

              He drinks up.

              TRANSITION.

              SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

              Several Detectives are working at desks. Kehoe walks into the
              office. He moves slowly to Cates' desk and slumps down in a
              nearby chair.

                                  KEHOE
                        You look awful.

                                  CATES
                        So do you...been a long day.

                                  KEHOE
                        Long night, too, from what I heard
                        ... Word's going around that in
                        addition to losing Ganz for the
                        second time, and in addition to
                        Haden busting you back to
                        Patrolman, some jig beat the crap
                        out of you.

                                  CATES
                        Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.

                                  KEHOE
                        Doesn't look like it.

                                  CATES
                        Nothing came in for me yet?  No
                        calls?

                                  KEHOE
                        Nothing.

              Kehoe's phone begins to ring.  Cates watches hopefully.

                                  KEHOE
                               (continuing)
                        Kehoe... Okay, hang on.

              Offers the phone to Cates.






                                  KEHOE
                               (continuing)
                        It's for you... Ordinance.

              Cates' excitement vanishes. He takes the receiver. Kehoe
              begins to clean off his desk.

                                  CATES
                        Hello... Yeah, okay.  I'll be in
                        tomorrow. That's right, you can
                        depend on it.  Okay?

              He slams down the receiver, leans back in the chair.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Bullshit red tape.

                                  KEHOE
                        I'm heading out. How about you?

              Cates shakes his head.

                                  CATES
                        I got to wait for a call.

                                  KEHOE
                        Okay.  See you in the morning...
                        you know, you ought to get some
                        rest...

              He walks out the door. Cates stares fixedly at the phone on
              the desk. Hoping Hammond will call... Across the room another
              phone starts to ring. Cates stares at the PLAINCLOTHESMAN who
              answers.

                                  PLAINCLOTHESMAN
                        Yeah, he's here.

              Cates stiffens.

                                  PLAINCLOTHESMAN
                               (continuing)
                        Cates... line twelve.

              Cates snatches up the phone, shouts into it...

                                  CATES
                        You motherfucker, where are you?

              ELAINE

              In the Chronicle Restaurant and Bar, a well appointed
              establishment off Montgomery Street.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?





                                  CATES
                        Elaine! I... I'm sorry... I was
                        expecting somebody else... police
                        business.

                                  ELAINE
                        No wonder you're so popular.

                                  CATES
                        No, it's I'm just surprised you
                        called.

                                  ELAINE
                        So am I.

                           ELAINE                        CATES
                   Jack, this afternoon...       Hey, look, when...

                                  ELAINE
                        You first.

                                  CATES
                        Look, I'm sorry about ... the way
                        things have been lately.  I know
                        I haven't been acting real great...

              Behind Cates, Kehoe steps back into the room.

                                  KEHOE
                        Hey, Cates...

              Cates swings around.

                                  KEHOE
                               (continuing)
                        I almost forgot.  That pal of
                        yours from the Vice Squad wants
                        you to call him.

                                  CATES
                        What?

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, are you still there?

                                  KEHOE
                        Yeah.  He said he rousted a bar
                        with you last night.

                                  CATES
                        Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't
                        you tell me before?

                                  KEHOE
                        I'm not paid to take your personal
                        calls.  He was in some bar. .. off
                        duty.





              Cates interrupts.

                                  CATES
                        The number ... what's the Goddamn
                        number?

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack?  What was that?

                                  KEHOE
                        Find it yourself.  It's on my desk.

              Cates speaks back into the receiver.

                                  CATES
                        Elaine, I gotta put you on hold...

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, wait...

                                  CATES
                        Just a second, that's all!

              He hits the bold button, starts rummaging through the desk.
              Paperwork scatters in all directions.

              Kehoe watches him in silence for awhile then leaves. Cates
              begins to dial.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Hammond... you son of a bitch,
                        where are you?

              Listens for a moment.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB

              Hammond on the phone as the band rocks away.   (MONKEY
              MASH - Track only)

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took
                        you so long to call, man? I been
                        waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in
                        the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's...
                        'Course you don't hang out here;
                        it's for the brothers.

              SQUAD ROOM

                                  CATES
                        I'll be there in a minute. You
                        don't move your ass, right?

              Slams down the phone. Starts toward the door. Remembers...






              He dashes back to the phone, hits the other line. Hears only
              a buzz.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Oh, shit.

              TRANSITION.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB

              Band blasting away on another number (THE BOYS ARE BACK IN
              TOWN - VOCAL)

              Hammond now in the middle of the floor dancing his ass off
              with a girl named CANDY. As the song ends...

                                  HAMMOND
                        My name's Reggie Hammond.

              Tries his big personality smile.

              This time gets one back.

                                  CANDY
                        I'm candy...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Excuse me, baby, but if i don't
                        get some action tonight, I'm gonna
                        bust.  You interested?

                                  CANDY
                        Hey, what kind of talk is that?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Oh ... You're a schoolteacher...

                                  CANDY
                        No, I go to a school to learn how
                        to do hair. It's a government
                        program. But really I want to be
                        a model - and I am definitely not
                        sellin'.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (humorously)
                        Goodbye.

              She stops him.

                                  CANDY
                        Hey, don't you think a hair
                        stylists got any interest in
                        gettin' it on?







                                  HAMMOND
                        Here you go sweetheart, throw it
                        my way.

              He gives her a kiss.

                                  CANDY
                        You're in a hurry.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, i been waiting three years.

                                  CANDY
                        You just quit bein' a priest or
                        somethin'?

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, baby, nothin' like that.
                        Look, there's a place across the
                        street. We can go right over
                        there...

                                  CANDY
                        What's the matter with my place?

                                  HAMMOND
                        No, it's gotta be here and now.
                        Believe me. Only I don't have the
                        damn money for a room...

              The band starts up again. ("LOVE SONGS ARE FOR CRAZIES" -
              VOCAL)

                                  CANDY
                        Yeah, well, even us non-pros
                        expect the guy to pay for the
                        room...

              Cates suddenly appears... steps between them. Yells above the
              band's noise.

                                  CATES
                        Where's luther?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Be polite. Say hello.  This is
                        Candy.

                                  CATES
                        Hello. And goodbye.

              She looks at Hammond. He nods.

                                  CANDY
                        Well, maybe I'll see you later ...







                                  HAMMOND
                        Here's hoping, baby...

              Candy leaves and melts into the crowd on the dance floor.

                                  CATES
                        What about Luther?

                                  HAMMOND
                        What about Ganz?

              Cates shrugs.

                                  CATES
                        We missed.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You missed ... Luther took a taxi
                        to the hotel across the street.
                        Made a phone call.

                                  CATES
                        Maybe we should pay Luther a
                        visit.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Let him get some sleep.  He's
                        going to need it.

              They move to the bar.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        They must have set up a meeting
                        for the morning; Luther left an 8
                        am wake-up and put up the "Don't
                        Disturb" sign.  He's trading his
                        girl for the money.  All we have
                        to do to grab Ganz is not go blind.

                                  CATES
                        So you took the rest of the night
                        off...

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        We don't have too many
                        cheerleaders in prison. I though
                        I might indulge myself in a little
                        trim.

              Cates orders two drinks.









                                  CATES
                        Tell me something.  Why didn't you
                        just take the money off Luther and
                        split?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Forget it. I want Ganz as bad as
                        you do and I got some other news
                        for you...

              He opens his jacket slightly. Reveals a shoulder holster and
              accompanying .45.  A long moment.

                                  CATES
                        I don't know why, but I'm going to
                        let you keep it. Maybe because you
                        told me you had it, or maybe just
                        because I'm too tired to argue...

                                  HAMMOND
                        You sure that's the reason?

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                        Thanks for callin' in... and I
                        guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I
                        called you Watermellon nigger...
                        those kinds of things. I was just
                        leanin' on ya, doin' my job.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Bein' good at your job don't
                        explain everything, Jack ...

                                  CATES
                        Yeah. Guess not.

              Hammond gives him a big smile.

                                  HAMMOND
                        As long as you're feeling like Abe
                        Lincoln, how about payin' me on
                        our bet?  We got time and all this
                        pussy around here's drivin' me
                        crazy. See that one over there,
                        the one I was with...

              He nods at Candy across the way.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, I see her.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I can just take her right across
                        the street to Luther's hotel.  All
                        I need is some money for the room.







                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)

              Big smile as Cates produces some cash. Hammond counts it
              eagerly. Looks around. Candy suddenly appears like a trout
              seeing a lure.  She grabs the money.

                                  CANDY
                        Hello, again.

                                  HAMMOND
                        I just struck it rich... I think
                        we can do a little business.  As
                        a matter of fact, I think we can
                        have a party.

              Hammond smiles, leads her out of the bar.

                                  CATES
                        Hurry back.

              Cates watches them go, downs his drink. He fishes in his
              pocket for a coin, moves to a wall phone. Dials...

              CHRONICLE RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT

              A COCKTAIL WAITRESS answers the phone as Elaine pours a drink.

                                  COCKTAIL WAITRESS
                        It's for you.

              Hands her the receiver.

                                  ELAINE
                        Hello.

                                  CATES
                        Hi, it's me...

                                  ELAINE
                        Fuck you.

              She slams down the receiver.

              SIDEWALK - FRONT OF VROMAN'S - NIGHT

              Hammond and Candy exit the rock club. A line of young Punkers
              waiting to get inside... Hammond and Candy are in a tight
              clinch, a little giggly.

                                  CANDY
                        So... what did you have in mind?

              Suddenly, Hammond sees Luther emerge from the Predmore across
              the street.





                                  HAMMOND
                        Oh no, not now!

              Luther moves down the street with the briefcase.  Hammond
              pulls Candy back inside Vroman's.

              VROMAN'S ROCK CLUB - BAR

              Rock group still blasting away... (LOVE SONGS ARE FOR
              CRAZIES - Vocal continues)

              Hammond and Candy reappear, knocking aside a waitress about
              to refill Cates' drink.

                                  CATES
                        That was quick.

                                  HAMMOND
                        When you been in prison three
                        years, it don't take long. Let's
                        go.

                                  CATES
                        Why?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Luther's on the move...

              Cates jumps up, runs out. Hammond looks at Candy.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        I'll be back. Trust me.

              He kisses her.

              Runs off after Cates. She stares at him in disbelief.

              STREET LIGHT

              Luther checking over his shoulder for shadows, walks down the
              block. Turns into a narrow street.

              A BUS STOP

              Luther waits, impatient.

              Checks his watch.

              Looks up and down the street.

              He double-checks the bus stop sign over his head.

              Just as a bus pulls to a stop, air brakes hissing ...








              LUTHER

              Gets in.

              Sees that the driver is Billy Bear...

              BUS

              The bus starts up. Luther hesitates in the front. On the wide
              rear seat is Ganz. Rosalie beside him.

                                  GANZ
                        Open your coat. Both sides.

              He shows he's not packed.

                                  LUTHER
                        Let her go.

                                  GANZ
                        First, the money.

              Luther takes a step.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Just show me.

              Luther puts the case on a side seat, opens it for display.

              ANOTHER BUS STOP

              Commuters look up expectantly. One of two drift toward the
              curb. Jump back in alarm as the bus roars by.

              BUS

              Ganz is satisfied. Luther closes the case.

                                  LUTHER
                        Rosalie, you okay?

                                  GANZ
                        What are you talkin' about? I said
                        I wouldn't hurt her.

              And then he shoots Luther. Right between the buttons.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        I never break my word.

              Laughs as Rosalie begins to scream.

              CATES' CADDY

              Barreling down the street, ignoring red lights.





              Hammond shouts over the wind.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Notice something funny about that
                        bus?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah. It missed the last four
                        stops.

              Cates pours on the gas.

              BILLY BEAR

              His eyes fall on the rear view mirror. A white Caddy dances
              in the vibrating glass. Billy looks over his shoulder at Ganz.

                                  BILLY
                        Ganz!

              THE CADDY

              Swerves into cross traffic, makes a big press forward. Comes
              abreast of the driver's side of the bus.

              GANZ

              Smashes a side window with the two handguns.

              Blasts away.

              Cates driving with one hand as he draws his gun.

              CATES

              Looks up as glass shards sparkle down.

              He speeds up ... he is neck and neck with the bus.

              Hammond has a clear shot of Billy Bear who gives a side
              glance at him;

              Hammond doesn't shoot...

              Cates slows down and fires...

              Billy is hit in the shoulder. Ganz runs up and fires again...
              Hammond is hit in the arm. Cates grabs Hammond by the shirt.
              Yanks him close. Throws the wheel over ...

              CADDY

              Swerves as bullets pepper the passenger side. Stuffing flies
              out of Hammondis still warm seat. The right hand windows
              explode. Then the Caddy spins out.







              THE BUS

              Roars away...

              THE CADDY

              Skids into a traffic sign, demolishing some newspaper
              machines. Cates curses, tries to start the car. The engine
              won't turn over. He looks at the distant bus.

                                  CATES
                        Goddamn! Goddamn!  Goddamn!

              Pounds on the dash. What's left of the windshield falls in at
              the impact.

              TRANSITION.

              SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT

              Cates at his desk. Hammond seated nearby, now with a bandaged
              arm.  Haden in front of Cates, furious.

                                  HADEN
                        A bus, you goddamn whiskey mick
                        cop, you lost a stolen bus... We
                        got five deaths related to Ganz,
                        all of 'em law enforcement
                        related, and you blow it for a
                        lousy nigger convict...

              Cates says nothing...

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        That's rights I called him a
                        nigger.  You bet I did ... I saw
                        the report on that little piece of
                        shit.  If he spent one legal day
                        in his whole life, it'd be a
                        record...This is it for you...
                        suspension, review board... you've
                        had it.  When it gets 'round you
                        protect a con rather than nail a
                        cop killer...

              Cates stands up.

                                  CATES
                        He's got more brains and more guts
                        in one corner of his asshole than
                        any cop I've worked with.










                                  HADEN
                        Just cause you say it with
                        conviction don't mean shit to
                        me... How you gonna take to a pink
                        slip, huh?.

              Cates stands. Moves to Hammond. Handcuffs himself to him.

                                  HADEN
                               (continuing)
                        Where the Christ do you think
                        you're going?

                                  CATES
                        I'm taking my prisoner back to
                        jail.

              Hammond looks at Haden.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Goin' a little hard on him, aren't
                        you?

                                  HADEN
                        Go fuck yourself convict.

                                  HAMMOND
                        You know for a man, you have very
                        pretty brown eyes.

              Cates and Hammond walk out.

              UNDERGROUND PARKING LOT - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

              Cates and Hammond walk stoically along a row of cars, arrive
              at Hammond's Porsche.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, how'd my car get here?

                                  CATES
                        I had it impounded.  Come on,
                        we'll use it for haulin' you back
                        to the slam.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Back to jail in my own car.  Ganz
                        got away. Got all my money. It
                        just don't seem right.

                                  CATES
                        I don't know about you, but I
                        could use a drink... I'll buy you
                        one.  It'll be my good-bye present.

              Takes off Hammond's cuffs.  Looks at them.. Throws them away.






                                  HAMMOND
                        Sorry we didn't do better, Jack.
                        I feel like I let you down.

                                  CATES
                        Naw, you didn't let me down.  It
                        was a long shot all the way.  We
                        gave 'em a good run at it.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, but we didn't get 'em.

              They get in and drive off.

              TRANSITION.

              EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

              The Porsche blasts by ... These men want a drink.

              TRANSITION.

              CHRONICLE RESTAURANT AND BAR - NIGHT

              Cates and Hammond walk in. It's late, the place is almost
              empty. The Bartender is a woman with her back to them
              conferring with a waitress about something.

                                  HAMMOND
                        It's late, they're closing...

                                  CATES
                        Don't worry about it.

              The barmaid turns around to take their order.  It's Elaine.

                                  ELAINE
                        Hey, I don't believe it.

                                  CATES
                        Hiya, kid.

                                  ELAINE
                        I ought to have you and your
                        friend thrown out...

                                  CATES
                        Don't.  We've had a hard night.

                                  ELAINE
                        I can see that.  Pardon me for
                        saying so, but you look like
                        shit.  What happened?









                                  CATES
                        We and my pal here have been
                        taking it on the chin for the last
                        few hours...

              Hammond looks at her. He nudges Cates.

                                  ELAINE
                        Who the hell are you?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Name's Hammond, Reggie Hammond.
                        I heard a lot about you. And any
                        friend of Jack's is a friend of
                        mine.

              Gives her a big smile.

                                  ELAINE
                        I'm not so sure I can say the same
                        thing...You don't look like a cop.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Well, I been workin' the other
                        side of the street for the last
                        few years.  And you don't exactly
                        look like a shrink, wearin' that
                        dress...

                                  ELAINE
                        Shrink major, not a shrink.

              She pours three glasses of cognac. A STRAGGLER at the end of
              the bar pipes up.

                                  STRAGGLER
                        Hey, lady, a drink here.

                                  ELAINE
                        We're closed.

                                  STRAGGLER
                        Hey, what the hell?

              Elaine turns to him; it's short and sweet.

                                  ELAINE
                        Drink your drink, pay up and get
                        out.

                                  STRAGGLER
                        You can't do this.  It's against...

                                  ELAINE
                        Hey, just fuck off.  My friends
                        have guns.






              Cates holds up his pistol. The man's eyes widen and he turns
              his angry move toward her into a skedaddle out of the bar.
              Elaine finishes drying a glass and approaches.

                                  ELAINE
                               (continuing)
                        You real down?

                                  CATES
                        I've been better...Dead end.  No
                        Ganz, no Indian.

              He finishes his drink, puts down the glass.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        I gotta call the station.

              Looks back at Hammond...

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Don't run off anywhere, okay?
                        I've already got enough to worry
                        about.

              Moves away.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hard man to live with.

                                  ELAINE
                        How would you know?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, two days with him is enough.

                                  ELAINE
                        That's no bull.

              She looks at him carefully. They both grin.

              CATES

              In the phone booth.

                                  CATES
                        Is there any report ... No ...
                        Just tell me... nothing..Yeah I
                        figured... Okay, sure.

              Hangs up.

              ELAINE AND HAMMOND

              Cates returns...






                                  CATES
                        Nothing.  No sign of Ganz.  No
                        sign of the Indian.  Airport's
                        clean.  Train station. Bus
                        station.  Docks... Shit...

                                  ELAINE
                        Ganz is going to be hard to track.
                        Just a pure schizo ... wires all
                        crossed... totally without any
                        pattern... kill anybody... The
                        Indian... himself... anybody...

                                  CATES
                        How do you know?

                                  ELAINE
                        Jack, it's all over the papers.
                        He's an obvious type.  But this
                        Indian...

              Hammond cuts in.

                                  HAMMOND
                        He was the only one of my bunch
                        that was my friend... He was
                        loyal, went all the way for you...

                                  ELAINE
                        In all due respect, he sounds kind
                        of pathetic to me.  The kind of
                        guy that runs home to his momma or
                        some girlfriend.  Have you two ace
                        detectives checked that out?

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, well the only woman of the
                        Indian's we ran into was shacked
                        up with her dyke girlfriend.  I
                        guess she went with him before she
                        came outta the Closet ... They
                        both looked mad enough to kill
                        him...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, too bad.  They were real
                        nice lookin' too...In bed
                        together, hardly any clothes one
                        watching TV...

                                  ELAINE
                        What makes you think they were
                        lesbians, or as you so quaintly
                        put it, dykes?








                                  CATES
                        Come on, they were a little old
                        for a slumber party.

                                  ELAINE
                        It might pay to reexamine a few of
                        your more primitive notions.  I
                        was in bed with a girlfriend
                        watching TV last week, Jack, and
                        one thing we know about me is I
                        happen not to be a lesbian ...
                        Now, if this Indian's girlfriend
                        got upset when you came looking
                        for him, it could just be she's
                        still vulnerable to him.

                                  CATES
                        So what?

                                  ELAINE
                        When a guy hurts you, then comes
                        back bleeding on his hands and
                        knees, who knows, he might just be
                        irrestible.

                                  CATES
                        Hey, Come on, shrink time's over.
                        They wouldn't go see some old
                        girlfriend.

                                  ELAINE
                        Oh, yeah, well look where you came
                        when you were down and out.

                                  HAMMOND
                        She's got a point there, Jack.

              Smiles. Cates reflects for a moment.

                                  CATES
                        It's the only thing we got.

              He looks at Elaine.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Whaddya think?

                                  ELAINE
                        What do I know?  I'm just a
                        bartender.

                                  CATES
                        Let's go, Reggie.

              He kisses Elaine.






                                  HAMMOND
                        Do I get to kiss her too?

                                  CATES
                        If she's right, and if you don't
                        screw up.

              They exit the bar.

              TRANSITION.

              EXT.  STREET - CHINATOVIN - NIGHT

              Cates and Hammond hidden in a doorway which affords them a
              good view of the alley landing to Casey and Sally's apartment.

                                  HAMMOND
                        What if your girl's theory turns
                        out to be bullshit?  I mean, they
                        could be in Rio de Janeiro.

                                  CATES
                        I've got to play it rough with
                        them. If they know anything, I'm
                        gonna know it.

              A woman appears, turning out to be Casey carrying a shopping
              bag.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, there she is...

                                  CATES
                        Whatever play I maker just back me
                        up.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If we run into Billy first, let me
                        try and talk him in.

                                  CATES
                        Sure, I'll give you a shot at it,
                        but Ganz is mine.  You know, that
                        big Indian plays it for keeps...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't
                        no sweetheart... I wouldn't like
                        it if this partnership ended
                        before it gets started.

                                  CATES
                        Partnership?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Well, you got to admit we come a
                        long way.





              Cates gives him a smile.

                                  CATES
                        Let's just do it.

              APARTMENT STAIRWELL

              As Casey opens the door and starts toward the.stairs, Cates
              and Hammond come through the door and grab her. They are now
              on the ground floor stairwell.

                                  CATES
                        I hear you've got visitors.

                                  CASEY
                        Would you guys...

                                  CATES
                        No time for any of that crap any
                        more, lady... I'll rip your lungs
                        out if you don't answer fast.

              Cates has her by the shoulder and arm; he twists her like a
              vise...

                                  HAMMOND
                        He means it...

              She looks at Cates, knows Hammond's correct.

                                  CASEY
                        Don't kill him.  Please, just
                        don't kill him.

              A long moment.

                                  CATES
                        You and the other one, you're
                        still Billy's girls. You always
                        were his girls...

                                  CASEY
                        Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love
                        with him, who wouldn't be...

                                  CATES
                        You're gonna help us take him.

                                  CASEY
                        No chance.

                                  CATES
                        He can live or die ... You let us
                        in and he's got a chance to make
                        it.  Otherwise, he gets ventilated.







              Casey's face is seared with pain at the thought of Billy
              dying.

                                  HAMMOND
                        If you help use he's got a chance,
                        lady.

                                  CASEY
                        Billy's in the first room off the
                        hall ... With rosalie ... He's
                        makin' her happy tonight.  You
                        don't understand about the way it
                        is with him, do ya?

                                  CATES
                        Where's ganz?

                                  CASEY
                        In the back.  Down the other
                        corridor.

              Cates looks at Reggie.

                                  CATES
                        Looks like you're gonna get your
                        chance.

              They move upward...

              INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

              Cates is stealthily going to the end of the second corridor
              of the kitchen and living room area. That corridor turns at
              a sharp angle and goes to the back. Hammond is at the very
              front of that first corridor..at a door ... he shoves it back.

              INT. FIRST BEDROOM

              There is a bed and  Rosalie, undressed, is in it... Billy is
              seated on the edge of it... pants on, shirt off, pulling on
              his boots. Suddenly, Hammond is pointing a gun at him...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Give it up, Billy.  You got no
                        shot at it.

              Billy stands.

                                  ROSALIE
                        Don't let him hurt met Billy.
                        You're not gonna let 'em hurt me,
                        are ya?

                                  BILLY
                        He won't hurt you.  He ain't gonna
                        do nothin' to you, he's just after
                        me.





                                  HAMMOND
                        I'm tellin' ya, Billy, give it up.

                                  BILLY
                        I never was much for bein'
                        rehabilitated.

              Billy looks at Hammond.  With lightning sudden quickness, he
              reaches and produces a huge Bowie knife from behind his back.
              Billy smiles, laughs...then with a sudden, awful roar, he
              leaps at Hamnond who unflinchingly fires his pistol.  The big
              slugs stop Billy cold and throw him back against the bed as
              Rosalie shrieks.

              INT. BACK BEDROOM

              Ganz, half-dressed, asleep, gun in hand, throws himself off
              the bed, pushes Sally out of the way ... opens the door and
              starts firing furiously down the corridor... He grabs the
              briefcase and runs to the window.

              INT. CORRIDOR/DOOWAY TO BACK BEDROOM

              Cates has ducked the bullets ... he is inching toward the
              door...

              He pulls it open...Ganz from the window fires another shot
              which almost gets him then vanishes down the fire escape...

              INT. BACK BEDROOM

              Sally gets to her feett yelling, runs at Cates as he appears
              and futilely tries to hit him....He throws her down on the
              bed as if she were a doll ... He goes to the window...

              EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

              Ganz peels down the fire escapes hits the ground. He stops
              for a second... Then Cates appears, Ganz fires a shot then
              starts to run. Cates keeps coming...

              INT. FIRST BEDROOM

              Hammond hears the gunfire, runs out of the room...

              CATES

              Dives down the fire escape.

              BATHROOM

              Hammond enters to find it empty of Ganz and Cates, only Sally
              crying hysterically ... He runs out.

              EXT. CHINATOWN STREET

              Ganz runs out the back alley ...Cates pursues...





              ALLEY

              Hammond runs down the stairs toward the front of the building.

              EXT. STREET

              Ganz runs, turns out of an alley onto a street baked with
              neon light. Cates pursues.

              EXT. FRONT OF CASEY'S BUILDING

              Hammond runs out, turns down the adjoining street.

              CATES

              Following Ganz, holding him in sight, but unable to get a
              shot off...

              PARALLEL STREET

              Hammond running down a street near the one where Ganz is
              being chased...

              MAIN STREET

              Cates fires at Ganz ... Ganz ducks in a doorway...

              HAMMOND

              on his street hears the shot... he runs toward it, down a
              narrow alley between two buildings....

              EXT. DOORWAY AT END OF ALLEY

              Ganz hears footsteps approach from the opposite direction of
              Cates.  They move very close to where be is crouched... it is
              Hammond coming toward him... Ganz suddenly rolls a garbage
              can in his path, dropping him like a stone.

              CATES

              Comes toward where he expects to find Ganz... Ganz has his
              arm around Hammond's throat and his gun to his ear...

                                  GANZ
                        Drop it... you come up against me,
                        you're gonna lose...

              Hammond drops his gun.

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Hey, cop, come on...l got
                        something for ya... come on...








              EXT.  MAIN STREET

              Cates comes out of the doorway from which he's fired...and
              comes into the middle of the street, gun up ... he puts it
              down when he sees Ganz with Hammond in jeopardy.  The hand
              that's around Hammond's throat also holds the black bag.
              Cates walks forward, his gun down at his side...

                                  GANZ
                        After I get outta this, cop...I'm
                        gonna live forever...

                                  CATES
                        I don't think you're gonna make it.

                                  GANZ
                        Whaddya mean...I got your gun ...
                        I got his money... I got
                        everything...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Give up.  He's crazy.  He'll kill
                        us both.

              Cates still walking...

                                  GANZ
                        He won't try it. He's a fucking
                        chickenshit cop. They're all
                        fucking wimps, right, Cates?

              They are now closer to each other. Ganz holding Hammond and
              the money...

                                  GANZ
                               (continuing)
                        Okay, cop ... give me your gun and
                        I'll let him live. Come on, Cates,
                        you're real good at giving up your
                        gun.

              Cates keeps the same methodical pace...

                                  CATES
                        Sure...

              Suddenly, he crouches and fires twice. Hammond twists as Ganz
              also fires. Ganz is hit in the collarbone and driven ten feet
              backward. His grip on Hammond drops, Hammond dives to the
              ground, looks at Cates.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Jesus Christ, I didn't think you'd
                        really do it. You are crazy.

              Ganz' gun still in his hand, but his arm useless at his side.
              Cates is frozen in the crouch, ready to fire again.





              Ganz is in enormous pain holding his bleeding chest... A look
              of childish disbelief passes over his face.

                                  GANZ
                        I got hit.  I can't believe it. I
                        got shot.

                                  CATES
                        You're done.  End of story.

                                  GANZ
                        I ain't gonna beg for my life. It
                        ain't cool.

              He runs at Cates full-speed, screaming, roaring, then is
              stopped by two more bullets that tear fist-sized holes in his
              chest. Cates rises from his crouch. Takes his gun out of
              Ganz' now lifeless hand. Then goes over to Hammond...

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yours?

              Cates raises the pistol.

                                  CATES
                        Mine...

              Pause.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        You okay?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a
                        second.

                                  CATES
                        You did pick a real strange time
                        to go and be brave all on your
                        own...

              Hammond smiles.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Just tryin' to get the money,
                        Jack.  Just tryin' to build up a
                        few points on that merit system.

              Cates smiles back, picks up the black bag as they move off.

              TRANSITION.

              ELAINE'S BATHROOM

              Cates in the tub, steam rushing from the water.






              Elaine sits on the porcelain edge as he splashes and soaps...

                                  ELAINE
                        How'd they take it back at
                        headquarters?

                                  CATES
                        Usual bullshit.  You make one
                        smart move and everybody wants to
                        be your friend... You know
                        somethin', shootin' guys sucks.
                        Especially compared to this.

                                  ELAINE
                        I've been waiting a long time to
                        hear you say that.

                                  CATES
                        Yeah, bein' a hard-ass all the
                        time is a real drag, but it works.

              He reaches out, lifts his watch from his pile of clothes on
              the floor.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        Three more hours...

                                  ELAINE
                        Where is he?

                                  CATES
                        Promised I'd turn my back while
                        he... ah, never mind...

                                  ELAINE
                        Tell me.

                                  CATES
                        He's takin' care of the same
                        business I'll be takin' care of -
                        soon as I dry off.

              Elaine smiles, leans close.

                                  ELAINE
                        You're impossible...

                                  CATES
                        That's what I always say.

              TRANSITION.

              CANDY'S ROOM - NIGHT

              Minimal crummy hotel room accommodations... Hammond is
              kissing her at the door, finishing buttoning all his buttons.





              He reaches for a wallet, gives her several bills.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Here you go, baby.

                                  CANDY
                        Hey, don't do that.  I said I
                        wasn't a pro, remember?

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, no, I'm tryin' to be nice.
                        Buy yourself something pretty.
                        I'd do it, but I got to go.  I got
                        this cop waitin' for me...

              They kiss... it's pretty romantic... She opens the door for
              him.

              CORRIDOR

              She stands at the top of the stairs; as Hammond walks down,
              he calls back to her over his shoulder ...

                                  HAMMOND
                        I'll be back in six months...
                        Maybe I'll make an honest woman of
                        you.

              He gives her a big sniile.

                                  HAMMOND
                               (continuing)
                        I'll buy ya the best dinner in San
                        Francisco...how'd that be? Then
                        we'll go dancin', okay?

                                  CANDY
                        Now you're talkin'. See ya...

              He moves off, still smiling, holding the black briefcase...

              STREET - NIGHT

              on a picturesque hill above the Haight. Cates standing near
              the wheel of Hammond's Porsche.  Hammond comes down the porch
              steps from the hotel.

                                  CATES
                        Okay, reggie, start bustin' my
                        chops... Tell me how great you
                        were with that chick.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Hey, Jack, real men don't have to
                        go in for that macho bullshit ...
                        but I was fantastic.







                        As a riatter of fact, I was so
                        good, I may have my cock done in
                        bronze.

              Cates holds up the black briefcase.

                                  CATES
                        I guess this is what you want to
                        talk about...All the pretty money
                        that's inside here.

              Cates takes the case to the trunk, opens it, deposits the
              case, locks the trunk.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been
                        waitin' three years for that.  I
                        don't think it's fair, man. What
                        about the merit system.? You were
                        gonnna give me a few thousand.

                                  CATES
                        There's nothin' to talk about.

              Another long exchange of looks. Then be hands Hammond the
              keys to the trunk.

                                  CATES
                               (continuing)
                        It's your money.  It'll be here in
                        six months when you get out.

                                  HAMMOND
                        And you're tellin' me you don't
                        want any of this cash?

                                  CATES
                        That's right. Not my style,
                        Reggie..

                                  HAMMOND
                        You are an awesomely weird cop.
                        Sure wish there were more like you
                        runnin' around out here.

                                  CATES
                        No, you don't. If I ever get word
                        of you steppin' over the line
                        again, I'm gonna ventilate that
                        suit of yours.

                                  HAMMOND
                        Spare met Jack. I'm into legit
                        investments from here on in.







              Cates gives him a very skeptical look, as they head for the
              car.

              Hammond gets in behind the wheel, Cates on the passenger side.

              Cates takes out a cigarette, starts to light it.

              Hammond takes the match does it for him.

                                  CATES
                        Thanks.

                                  HAMMOND
                        No trouble, Jack. But, listen,
                        suppose I stay a crook?  Where'd
                        you get the idea that you could
                        catch me?

              They both smile. Hammond socks it into gear and they drive
              off into the far distance...

                                             END.

          It's another picture perfect day in San Diego. The beaches,
          golf courses, and yacht clubs are packed with hundreds of
          rapturous citizens.

          A BUS pulls up and unloads it's passengers.
                         
          We follow ADAM SCHWARTZ(25), a kind faced, mild mannered,
          pragmatist - who despite his youth has the cynicism of an old
          man. He steps off the bus, crosses the street and approaches
          MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL.
                         
                         
          INT. MOUNT SINAI HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Adam enters the Hospital. The mood is calm. All the chaos one
          would expect to find in a hospital of this size is tucked
          away behind the sterile and monochrome walls.
                         
          Adam walks to the reception counter. The RECEPTIONIST is
          engrossed with the latest edition of US Weekly. She ignores
          Adam who just stands there awkwardly, unsure of what to do.
                         
          Adam gives out a small cough to grab her attention. The
          Receptionist keeps her eyes fixed on her magazine.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Can I help you?
                         
                          ADAM
           I have an appointment.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Name?
                         
                          ADAM
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          The Receptionist says nothing. Adam stands silent, not
          knowing what to do. He coughs again.
                         
          Annoyed, the Receptionist looks up but says nothing.
           2.
                         
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (CONFUSED)
           Um, am I supposed to go somewhere?
                         
          With her eyes the Receptionist points to the waiting area.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Oh, should I go sit?
                         
          The Receptionist rolls her eyes and returns to her magazine.
                         
          Adam looks around the empty waiting room. He takes a seat and
          browses through a dozen outdated magazines: Highlights, Time,
          Life, Modern Maternity, etc. Only moments later, as though he
          hadn't just introduced himself, the Receptionist calls out:
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          Adam looks around the waiting room. There's no one else
          there. Again the receptionist calls out again -
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, that's me.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST
           Follow me.
                         
          The Receptionist leads Adam to a small changing room and
          hands him a hospital gown.
                         
                          RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D)
           Put this on.
                         
                          ADAM
           Do I need to take off all my
           clothes?
                         
          The Receptionist stares blankly at Adam.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I'll figure it out.
                         
          The Receptionist leaves. Adam awkwardly undresses and slips
          on the hospital gown. Unsure which end of the gown is the
          front, Adam adjusts the garment a few times until he decides
          he has it right.
                         
          Adam pulls back the curtain of the changing room to find
          JOANNE, an overly cheery nurse.
           3.
                         
                         
                          NURSE JOANNE
           Hi Adam, my name is Joanne, so nice
           to meet you.
                         
          Adam scratches his chest, the hospital gown is beginning to
          irritate his skin.
                         
                          ADAM
           You don't happen to have anything
           in a cotton blend?
                         
                          NURSE JOANNE
                          (LAUGHS)
           Cotton. You're funny.
                         
          Joanne hands Adam a giant specimen cup marked with a thick
          yellow line.
                         
           NURSE JOANNE (CONT'D)
           Now I'm going to need you to fill
           this cup with urine. You think you
           can do that?
                         
                          ADAM
           You want me to fill this entire
           cup.
                         
                          JOANNE
           Yup.
                         
          Adam looks down at the cup in total disbelief.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's gonna take me at least a week
           to fill this. Can I take it home?
                         
                          JOANNE
                          (LAUGHS)
           Take it home. You're so funny.
                         
          The CAMERA PANS to reveal a group of MEDICAL STUDENTS taking
          diligent notes in the background. WE PAN AGAIN this time to
          the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. BATHROOM
                         
          Adam struggles to fill the cup. After a few beats, there's a
          knock on the door.
                         
           JOANNE (O.S.)
           You okay in there Adam?
           4.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Just another minute.
                         
          Adam looks down at the empty cup in frustration. The CAMERA
          PANS to the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. X-RAY ROOM
                         
          Adam stands in front of an X-Ray machine. The APATHETIC
          TECHNICIAN has him stand in a dozen uncomfortable positions
          for long periods of time: sideways, one arm in the air, then
          the other arm, on one leg, then the other, one leg in the
          air, then the other, and so on.
                         
          Again we see the group of Medical Students taking notes. The
          CAMERA PANS to the next room:

          Joanne pulls out a giant needle.
                         
                          JOANNE
           Here comes the choo-choo!
                         
          In the back we see the Med Students still taking notes. The
          CAMERA PANS to the next room:
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM
                         
          Adam is lying on the gurney of an MRI machine. He is slowly
          drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
                         
                          TECHNICIAN
                          (AUTHORITATIVELY)
           Now make sure you lie completely
           still. Otherwise we'll have to do
           it all over again. Which we're not
           going to have to do, right?
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. MRI ROOM - LATER
                         
          Adam lies perfectly still in the enclosed body scanner.
                         
                          ADAM
           Hello? Is anybody out there?
                         
          There's no one there. He's been left unattended. The MRI
          Technician is watching the Laker game in the next room.
           5.
                         
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I have to pee.
                         
          The Med Students continue to take notes.

          EXT. SAN DIEGO - EVENING
                         
          Through the window of the hospital the CAMERA PULLS OUT and
          PANS across the San Diego skyline. We watch as the Sun sets
          to night, then rises to morning...
                         
                         
          EXT. SAN DIEGO BEACH - MORNING
                         
                         SUPER: JUNE
                         
          It's a gray morning as the thick spring fog slowly begins to
          lift. With no one in sight, the only sound that can be heard
          is that of the waves crashing onto the shoreline and then
          rolling back out to the Pacific Ocean.
                         
          About a mile inland, we come upon:
                         
                         
          EXT. GRAND VIEW GATED COMMUNITY - DAY
                         
          Rows of identical two and three bedroom town houses with
          lawns groomed to perfection fill the community. This is
          Southern California Suburbia.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing gets increasingly louder and
          louder as we PUSH IN ON:
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The interior of Adam's house is spotless. Pictures on the
          walls: Adam and his dad sailing. Adam and his parents at his
          Bar Mitzvah. Adam and his best friend, Seth, at High School
          Graduation. A University of Berkeley hat. A National Academic
          Achievement Award in the Sciences.
                         
          Curled in a fetal position, Adam sleeps peacefully next to
          RACHEL (25), his loving girlfriend. Cute, charming, and
          artsy, Rachel is "Winnie Cooper" all grown up.
                         
          The sound of the waves crashing stops abruptly. A loud
          obnoxious alarm clock goes off. Startled, Adam jumps up.
          Drenched in sweat, and completely disoriented, he looks
          around in confusion.
           6.
                         
                         
          After a moment, Adam pulls an earplug out of each ear, and
          turns off the alarm. The sound of the crashing waves turns
          back on. Adam pushes a button on the alarm clock and the
          sound of the waves stops, but the loud obnoxious alarm
          returns. He pushes the clock again. The alarm turns off but
          now we hear the sound of crickets chirping. Again Adam pushes
          a button, this time we hear the sound of a loud thunder/rain
          storm, he pushes a button again, this time we hear the sound
          of loud clanging church bells. Rachel rolls over -
                         
                          RACHEL
           (asleep and incoherent)
           Make it stop.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (WHISPERS)
           It won't turn off.
                         
          Frustrated, Adam tries pushing all the buttons. This only
          makes it worse. We hear ALL of the previous sounds
          simultaneously sound off. Rachel rolls over and moans as she
          puts a pillow over her head.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           Sorry.
                         
          Adam reaches down and unplugs the alarm clock, bringing an
          end to the noise. He sits for a moment at the edge of the
          bed, collects himself.
                         
          Adam looks down at Rachel and begins kissing her neck.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Mmmmm.
                         
          Rachel gently strokes her fingers through Adam's hair.
          Something catches her attention - a single strand of hair.
          She holds it up.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Oh my god.
                         
                          ADAM
           What?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I think you have a gray hair.
                         
                          ADAM
           Really?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I'm gonna pull it out.
           7.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           No! Don't touch it.
                         
          Adam jumps from bed. He rushes into the bathroom. Rachel
          rolls back to sleep.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam stands in front of the mirror and searches for the gray
          hair. Once he finds it, he holds it out for a closer look. It
          is in fact a gray hair. He smiles.
                         
                         
          INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          As Adam showers, he tries to squirt shampoo into his hand,
          but the bottle is empty. He looks over at Rachel's large
          assortment of shower products, finds one that smells
          pleasant, Fructis by L'Oreal, and squirts some into his hair.
          He then proceeds to lather his entire body in the product.
                         
                         
          INT. BEDROOM CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Adam dresses in front of the bathroom mirror. His outfit is
          well put together, but not what you would expect of someone

          BRUSH and meticulously combs his cardigan.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER
                         
          SETH (25), pulls up in front of Adam's house in his white
          Neon and HONKS the horn. On the bumper is a sticker: "Let's
          put the Christ back in Christmas."
                         
          Overweight, well dressed, and wearing an air of confidence,
          Seth pulls out a massive joint, lights it and takes a hit.
                         
          Just then Seth looks over at 3 YOUNG SCHOOL CHILDREN and
          their MOTHER waiting for the school bus. The mother's jaw is
          on the ground in shock. Seth hides the joint and smiles in
          embarrassment.
                         
                          SETH
           Hi kids. Beautiful day isn't it?
                         
          The mother quickly moves her kids out of sight.
                         
          Adam approaches Seth's car. He spots his neighbors ANDREW and
          MISSY DONNELLY (late 40's) getting into their car. They wave
          to Adam.

           Sorry about the noise last night.
                         
          Adam shrugs as if to say "what the fuck?" Andrew and Missy
          giggle as they get into their car.

           I ran out of shampoo. I had to use
           Rachel's.

          Adam tries to close his window. The child safety lock is on.

          Adam begins to clear his throat, Seth turns the music even
          louder.

           I guess it is only natural though,
           as we get older, more mature,

           So when does it become a big deal?
           Five weeks? Six weeks? A year? My

                          ADAM
           But they're not Rachel. I don't
           know how to explain it, but being
           with her just feels right. And I'm
           not going to overlook that just
           cause we're in a lull.

           My parents are in a lull, which is
           what happens after 35 years of
           marriage. You've only been dating
           her four months. At our age sex is
           all we have. Every time she refuses
           to sleep with you a small piece of
           every man's soul dies. She's
           killing us Adam...You're a semi-
           smart, semi-successful, semi-
           average looking dude. Just based on

           one third of the female population.

          Demetri examines Adam. He's not impressed with what he sees.
                         
                          DEMETRI

          leave a dollar.

          the finishing touches on the CRO MAGNON exhibit - it's an
          elaborate life sized diorama depicting the life of a family
          of four Cro Magnons. Outside their hut it's snowing, but
          inside there's a large fire and decorative horse drawings on
          the walls. The MAN instructs his SON to paint as the WOMAN

          fossil of a VELOCIRAPTOR next to the mother and daughter. The
          dinosaur looks poised to pounce. Adam notices.

           It's a velociraptor.

           Why can't we just say it was the
           first domesticated pet?...People
           love dinosaurs.

          Adam cringes in frustration.
                         
                          ADAM
           Greg you can't just...that's a 75
           million year old fossil...just
           please, put it away before someone
           sees it.
                         
          Greg reluctantly goes to put the dinosaur away. He flaps the
          dinosaur's arm in the air - waving goodbye to Adam.

           This is Homo Neanderthalensis - the
           Neanderthal Man. For over 150,000
           years his ancestors dominated all
           of Europe. But then about 30,000
           years ago, Neanderthals began to
           disappear, until one day, their
           entire civilization was gone.

                          ADAM
           Well no one knows for sure. But
           it's suspected that because
           Neanderthal was a nomadic huntsman,
           he roamed the land, only fending
           for himself - never learning to
           cohabitate with others. So as Cro
           Magnon families settled into
           Europe, they took over the land.
           One by one, Neanderthal was pushed
           out...and never seen, or heard from
           again.

           vanished doesn't mean they're gone.

           Neanderthal walking among us right

           DR. ROSS
           Well Adam it's actually quite
           fascinating. Your cancer is the
           result of an incredibly rare gene
           mutation in chromosome 17p in the
           p53 Gene that causes the growth of
           malignant cells in tissue around
           the nerves. In your case it's grown
           along the nerves in your lower
           spine.
                         
          Adam looks at himself in the mirror.

           But, look at me. I don't look sick.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Cancer often has no specific
           symptoms. People can go years with
           out knowing they're sick. We're
           lucky we caught it before it
           metastasizes.

           I'm going to put you on a 4 month

           from work.
                         
          This is real. Adam walks to the window and presses his face
          against the glass. He looks down at the city below. From 15
          stories up, the people on the street look like miniature
          figurines.
                         
          Adam turns back to Dr. Ross.
                         
                          ADAM
           Can't you just cut it out of me?
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Yes, that is an option. But because
           the tumor has spread to a such
           significant size. Cutting it out
           now would be risky.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well what are my chances of beating
           this?
                         
          Dr. Ross puts on his best act of reassurance. His words are
          seemingly genuine, his tone is anything but.
                         
           DR. Ross
           Listen, you're in good hands. The
           best thing for you to do right now
           is to not worry...Let me do the
           worrying. Alright?
                         
          Dr. Ross takes a long look at Adam's devastated face.
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           Maybe you should talk to someone.
                         
          Dr. Ross hands Adam a business card for the "Mount Sinai
          Psychology Group".
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           We have a whole department of

           They specialize in cases...in
           these...sort of matters. They'll be
           able to help you.
                         
          Not knowing what else to say, Dr. Ross looks at his watch,
          looks back to Adam, and moves to the door.

          Adam sits staring at the screen. This is not good.
                         
          The LIBRARIAN, a tall blond surfer type, taps Adam on the
          shoulder.
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           Hey bro, time's up.
                         
          Startled. Adam looks up at the librarian.
                         
                          ADAM
           Can I have just a few more minutes?
                         
                          LIBRARIAN
           Sorry bro. Twenty minute limit.

           Rules.
                         
          The librarian motions to the LONG LINE of mostly HOMELESS
          CUSTOMERS waiting to use the computer.
                         
                         
          INT. BUS - EVENING
                         
          Adam sits deep in thought.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - SAME TIME
                         
          The bus stops. Adam gets off, walks to his house, and takes a
          deep breath...
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam enters the living room - it's empty. NPR News is on the
          radio. Fresh paint dries on a canvas resting on an easel. The
          sound of someone cooking comes from the kitchen.
           21.
                         
                         
           RACHEL (O.S.)
           Adam? Is that you?
                         
          Adam walks into the kitchen. Rachel is at the stove cooking
          in her underwear. Adam stands in the doorway watching her.
          God she looks sexy. Rachel turns -
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           (in a Hungarian accent)
           Welcome home Mr. Adam. I made
           vegetarian goulash.
                         
          Like a ballerina, Rachel crosses to Adam on her tip toes
          holding out a spoon of her goulash. She holds up the offering
          to Adam's mouth. He takes a small bite and smiles, trying to
          hide his internal distress. His sad eyes tell Rachel another
          story.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           (still using accent)
           What is wrong?
                         
                          ADAM
           Nothing.
                         
                          RACHEL
           (still using accent)
           Liar.
                         
          This is not going to be easy.
                         
                          ADAM
           We need to talk.
                         
          Rachel drops the accent. This seems serious.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Why? What's going on?
                         
                          ADAM
           I had a doctor's appointment today.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (WORRIED)
           What kind of doctor's appointment?
                         
          Adam has no idea what to say.
                         
                          ADAM
           Have you ever seen the movie
           "Beaches"?
                         
                          RACHEL
           You mean with Bette Midler?
           22.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah that one.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Not as good as "The Rose", but
           good.
                         
                          ADAM
           Remember the end of "Beaches"?
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (CONFUSED)
           Yeah. Sad....What does that have to
           do with you?
                         
          Adam just looks her in the eyes...Rachel gets it.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Oh. Oh my god.
                         
          In total shock, Rachel covers her mouth.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What kind?
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't know.
                         
                          RACHEL
           You don't know?
                         
                          ADAM
           Well I do know, but I can't
           pronounce it. Neuroscharnoma or
           something.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Well how bad is it?
                         
                          ADAM
           It's not good.
                         
          Rachel hugs Adam. Soaking in the comfort, Adam rests his head
          on her shoulder. She gently strokes his hair. Adam's hand
          slowly moves down Rachel's back. He starts kissing her neck.
          He knows it's wrong, but can't help it, the only thing
          running through his mind is sex.
                         
          After a beat Rachel pulls away.
                         
                          RACHEL
           (begins to cry)
           You have cancer.
           23.
                         
                         
          Heart racing, Rachel opens the top pantry. She reaches back
          as far as she can and pulls out a cookie jar. She sticks her
          hand in the jar and pulls out an old pack of American
          Spirits. Adam looks at Rachel disapprovingly.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Not now.
                         
                          ADAM
           I just think it's an interesting
           time to take up smoking again.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam I'm 24 years old!
                          (CATCHES HERSELF)
           You're 25.
                         
          Rachel puts one of the cigarettes to her mouth, lights it on
          the stove and takes a drag.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What are we going to do? I don't
           know what to do.
                         
          Rachel begins compulsively pulling drags from the cigarette.
          Adam takes the cigarette out of her hand. He goes to put it
          out, but takes a drag instead. He then hugs Rachel with one
          hand and opens the window with the other; he proceeds to
          discreetly fan out the cigarette smoke.
                         
                          ADAM
           Sshhhh. Everything's going to be
           alright Yammy. I'm going to start
           chemo in a few days.
                          (POSITIVE)
           We're going to get through this.
                         
          They embrace in total silence...A beat. And then Adam groans
          with the realization -
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Ugh...and my parents are coming
           over for dinner.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Do they know?
                         
          Adam is clearly not in the mood to see his parents.
                         
                          ADAM
           No.
           24.

          INT. FOYER - ADAM'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Rachel and Adam stand in front of the door.
                         
                          ADAM
           3...2...1...
                         
          Rachel opens the door.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (BIG SMILE)
           Hey.
                         
          Adam's mother, EDITH SCHWARTZ (55) enters. Edith is a short,
          portly woman with thick glasses and a bright red sweatshirt
          bearing a cross-stitched cat on it. If the borough of Queens
          and the city of Milwaukee had a child, it would be Edith.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (EXCITED)
           There they are!
                         
          Edith gives Rachel a big hug, and grabs for her left hand.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           I can't wait to hear the big news.
                         
                          ADAM
           Where's dad?
                         
          ART SCHWARTZ(58) enters the house carrying a CAT. Due to a
          stroke 10 years prior, he carries a limp and is a little out
          of it.
                         
                          ART
           I found your cat playing in the
           neighbors yard.
                         
                          ADAM
           Dad, I don't have a cat.
                         
          Art drops the cat and it bolts out the door.
                         
                          EDITH
           So what's for dinner?
           25.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S DINING ROOM - LATER
                         
          Everyone sits around the table. Edith pokes at her plate of
          vegetarian goulash, confused as to what she's looking at.
                         
                          RACHEL
           If I had known you were coming I
           would have made something else.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'm just glad to finally be sharing
           a shabbat dinner with my son...
           (looks at her plate)
           So this isn't meat?
                         
                          RACHEL
           No it's called sei-tan.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's made of wheat gluten.
                         
          Edith looks more confused.
                         
                          EDITH
           But it's not meat.
                         
                          RACHEL
           No, but it has a texture just like
           meat.
                         
          Edith reluctantly takes a small bite of the goulash.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (INSINCERE)
           Mmmmm. It's Good.
                         
          Edith puts her spoon down. She pulls a handful of pills out
          her fanny-pack and puts them in front of Art.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Art, take your pills.
                         
          Art picks up the pills and puts them in his mouth, but
          doesn't swallow.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Swallow.
                         
          As Art swallows, Edith eagerly turns her attention to Rachel.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           So? Did you set a date?
           26.
                         
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (CONFUSED)
           A date?
                         
                          EDITH
                          (TO ADAM)
           Do not do summer like your cousin,
           remember how awful that was?
           Schlepping around in the heat like
           that. Plus the bugs and the gnats.
                         
                          ADAM
           (whispers to Rachel)
           What is she talking about?
                         
                          EDITH
           And now Rachel. I know we haven't
           discussed this, but are you going
           to convert?
                         
                          RACHEL
           (whispers to Adam)
           She thinks we're getting married.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom. We're not getting married.
                         
                          EDITH
           Oh thank god.
                          (TO RACHEL)
           No offense.
                          (TO ADAM)
           So then what's the big news that
           you made us rush all the way over
           here.
                         
          Not knowing how to tell his mother the upsetting news...
                         
                          ADAM
           Have you ever seen "Terms of
           Endearment"?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Oh jesus Adam, just tell her.
                         
                          EDITH
           Tell me what?
                         
                          ADAM
           Alright fine. But, before I tell
           you, you have to promise me you're
           going to stay calm.
           27.
                         
                         
                          EDITH
           Oh Adam, don't be so overdramatic.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, just promise me. Okay?
                         
                          EDITH
           I promise...You make me out to be
           some kind of irrational loon.
                         
          Here goes nothing.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (MUMBLES)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
           What?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (MUMBLES)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (TO RACHEL)
           What is he saying?
                         
                          ADAM
           (takes a deep breath)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
           Cancer? What do you mean you have
           cancer?
                         
                          ADAM
           I - HAVE - CANCER.
                         
                          EDITH
           I don't understand.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, I have a giant tumor in my
           spine.
                         
          Edith sits motionless for what seems an eternity. The only
          indication that she's not dead is the movement of her index
          finger, which twitches uncontrollably. Adam sits uneasy,
          tying to anticipate his mother's next move.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Mom?
           28.
                         
                         
          Edith calmly rises from of her seat and heads to the kitchen.
          Adam follows after her.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Mom, what are you doing?
                         
          Edith lights the stove, and puts up a kettle of Tea.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'm making you green tea.
                         
                          ADAM
           Please, will you come sit down.
                         
          Edith holds up the package of Green Tea.
                         
                          EDITH
           I saw on the Today Show that it
           reduces your risk of getting cancer
           by fifteen percent.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, I already have cancer.
                         
          Refusing to look at her son, Edith frantically rifles through
          her fanny pack.
                         
                          EDITH
           Here take these.
                         
          Her hands now shaking uncontrollably, Edith hands Adam a
          large number of prescription pills.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Aspirin, Zoloft, Lexapro, Lipitor,
           Flagel, Ditropan, Alka Seltzer.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, please, stop. I don't need
           these.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (YELLS)
           Just take the god-damn pills.
                         
          Adam take Edith's hand.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom.
                         
          Edith's a nervous wreck, frantic and hysterical.
                         
                          EDITH
           How could this happen?
           29.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           It's genetic.
                         
                          EDITH
           Genetic? It must be from your
           father's side of the family,
           they're always getting sick. Your
           uncle Bobby just got Crohns.
                         
          Adam's father looks up from his plate of goulash...
                         
                          ART
           That's a disorder of the bowels,
           son. How are your bowels?
                         
                          ADAM
           The problem is not with my bowels.
                         
                          ART
           You're a lucky man.
                         
                          ADAM
           Thanks dad.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'm moving in.
                         
                          ADAM
           What? No. Absolutely not.
                         
                          EDITH
           Adam, I'm your mother, and I need
           to be close to you in your time of
           need.
                         
                          ADAM
           That's a terrible idea.
                         
                          EDITH
           Well who's going to take care of
           you?
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom, I'm fine.
                         
                          EDITH
           I think I have a right to take care
           of my son with cancer.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's nothing. Really.
           30.
                         
                         
                          EDITH
           Nothing! You tell me you have
           cancer of the spine and now you
           tell me it's nothing.
                         
          Adam looks to Rachel for support.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Edith, I can't even imagine how
           hard this must be for you. But I
           promise, there's nothing for you to
           worry about. I'm going to be here
           every step of the way, to help take
           good care of your son.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (TO ADAM)
           You're a very lucky boy to be with
           such a good girl. You know that?
           You don't deserve her.
                         
          Adam looks at Rachel and smiles.
                         
                          ADAM
           I know.
                         
                         
          INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
                         
          Adam and Seth stand on an endless line of BUSINESS MEN and
          WOMEN waiting for their morning coffee. Greg is at the front
          of that line - he's taking forever to decide what he wants.
          Adam impatiently looks at his watch.
                         
                          ADAM
           What's taking him so long? How hard
           is it to buy a cup of coffee?
                         
          Seth ignores Adam as he stares at the cleavage on the WOMAN
          behind him.
                         
                          SETH
           (quietly to Adam)
           Look at how tight that shirt is.
           She's totally aware of how large
           her breasts look too. This morning
           when she got dressed, she said to
           herself - "I have these things and
           I want the world to see them."
                         
          Greg looks up at the menu of endless options.
           31.
                         
                         
                          GREG
           What about that frozen drink,
           what's that like?
                         
                          BARISTA
                          (ENTHUSIASTIC)
           The Bavarian Blender. It's absolute
           heaven.
                         
                          GREG
           I don't know. Does it have a lot of
           sugar?
                         
                          ADAM
           We've been here 20 minutes. What's
           he shopping for a car?
                         
          Seth's eyes are still fixed on the woman's breasts.
                         
                          SETH
           Why are you in such a rush?
                         
          Adam looks around at all the stodgy business men all having
          menial conversations.
                         
                          ADAM
           Is this really how you want to
           spend the rest of your life?
           Wasting away in this place?
                         
          Greg still hasn't made up his mind. Adam snaps.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I don't believe it. Why can't he
           just get a latte like he does every
           morning.
                         
                          SETH
           Relax. We have plenty of time.
                         
                          ADAM
           No we don't have plenty of time!
           Life is finite.
                         
                          SETH
           What the fuck is wrong with you?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (QUIETLY)
           I have cancer.
                         
                          SETH
                          (LAUGHS)
           Yeah right.
           32.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm serious.
                         
                          SETH
           Get the fuck out of here. You have
           cancer?
                         
          People in line look at Seth.
                         
                          ADAM
           Maybe a little louder, you can make
           a special announcement.

                          ADAM
           Yesterday. They found a tumor in my
           spine.
                         
                          SETH

           What do you mean who?
                         
                          SETH
           Who found the tumor?

           Lewis and Clark...The doctors found
           it.
                         
                          SETH
           When were you going to tell me?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm telling you now.
                         
                          SETH
           If I had cancer I'd tell you right
           away.
                         
                          ADAM
           What do you want the Better Friend

           bring up.
                         
                          SETH
           Holy shit!
                         
          Seth takes a deep breath. A look of panic sweeps across his
          face...he quickly shakes it off.

           Okay, let's relax here.
                          (BEAT)
           I think the best thing to do is to
           look on the bright side.
                         
                          ADAM
           The bright side of what?

          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. Adam
          kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. He takes a few
          steps and then turns back. He gives her a nervous smile and
          then continues into the hospital.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Adam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of
          patients, none of whom are under the age of 40. In Adam's
          hand is the business card with "Mount Sinai Psychology Group"
          written on it. He finds the office and knocks on the half
          opened door.
                         
          The office is small, cold and emotionless - with stacks of
          psychology books and files strewn about.
                         
          An attractive young woman, KATIE (26), sits behind a desk
          reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich. Katie
          takes her job very seriously, but has not quite mastered the
          art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student.
                         
          Kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich.
                         
                          KATIE
           (mouth full of food)
           Can I help you?
                         
                          ADAM
           I have an appointment with Dr.
           McRae.
           34.
                         
                         
          Katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts
          her hand out to shake Adam's.
                         
                          KATIE
           Please call me Katie.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (CONFUSED)
           You're Dr. McRae?
                         
                          KATIE
           You were expecting someone else?
                         
          Katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away.
                         
                          ADAM
           Aren't you supposed to be like
           sixty-five and wear earth toned
           sweaters?
                         
                          KATIE
                          (SLIGHTLY DEFENSIVE)
           Why? Did someone say that's what I
           look like?
                         
                          ADAM
           No, no, no. I was just expecting
           someone older.
                         
                          KATIE
           Sorry to disappoint you.
                         
                          ADAM
           No believe me, you're fine. Better
           than fine, you're Dr.
           McRae...you're a doctor? How old
           are you?

           Who?
                         
                          ADAM

          Off Katie's blank look.

                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           ...The teenage doctor.
                         
                          KATIE
           Does he work here?
                         
                          ADAM
           No. Nevermind...but aren't you
           young to be a doctor?
                         
                          KATIE
           I'm actually in my final semester
           of medical school.
           (off Adam's look)
           This is a training hospital.
                         
                          ADAM
           So have you had many patients?
                         
                          KATIE
           You're actually my first.
                         
          That did not help to ease Adam's anxiety.
                         
                          ADAM
           Oh.
                         
                          KATIE
           Please sit.
                         
          Adam notices a dark stain on the couch. He sits as far from
          it as possible.
                         
          Katie pulls out Adam's file and sits in a chair across from
          him. Adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Dr. Ross filled me in on your
           situation. Tell me, how have you
           been feeling?
                         
                          ADAM
           Honestly. I feel fine.
                         
                          KATIE
           I think that's great considering
           what you're going through.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, but I tend to internalize
           everything so, who knows.
           36.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
          You mean you repress as a coping
          mechanism.
                         
                          ADAM
          Is that what I do?
                         
                          KATIE
          That's what you just said.
                         
                          ADAM
          The way I say it sounds cute in a
          neurotic way. When you say it, it's
          like an indictment. The word
          "repress" - sounds so harsh.
                         
                          KATIE
          It's actually quite common.
                         
                          ADAM
          Oh good, I'd hate to think I'm
          anything but an emotional sheep.
                         
                          KATIE
          Don't think of it in those terms.
          It's not like it's been a conscious
          decision on your part. What's
          important now is for you to be
          aware of the way you treat your
          emotions and for me to help you
          make adjustments.
                         
                          ADAM
          So how do we do that?
                         
                          KATIE
          The first thing I want you to do is
          to stop looking at cancer as a
          burden. Cancer has come into your
          life to show you that your
          emotional and physical bodies are
          out of balance. This is your chance
          to correct that.
                         
                          ADAM
          You're not in a cult are you?
                         
                          KATIE
          Now, why do you say that?
                         
                          ADAM
          I don't know, it was a bad joke.
           37.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
           But there's a reason. You chose to
           use humor rather than express how
           you really feel.
                         
          Katie is losing Adam.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           In order to heal the body, you must
           heal the mind. It's imperative that
           you free yourself from stress and
           anger. Get rid of all those
           negative emotions stored deep
           inside.
                         
          Adam's mind drifts away from Katie. He focuses on all the
          clutter. The slanted clock. The wilting plant. The crumbled
          paper on the floor. The mess is driving him crazy.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           So today what I want to do is start
           you on some very simple relaxation
           therapy.
                         
          Katie presses play on her iPod. We hear the soothing sounds
          of new agey flute music. Adam looks up in confusion.
                         
                          ADAM
           Huh?
                         
                          KATIE
           I want you to lay back and close
           your eyes.
                         
          Adam looks down at the coffee stained couch.
                         
                          ADAM
           Lay here?
                         
                          KATIE
           Yes, I want you to just lay back,
           and let go.
                         
                          ADAM
           Shouldn't we be analyzing my
           childhood? Or my days as a call
           girl?
                         
                          KATIE
           Another joke?
           38.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SHRUGS)
           Oh come on. Nothing? That was
           funny.
                         
                          KATIE
           Ssshhhhh...
                         
          Katie stands behind Adam and places her hands on his
          shoulders. Despite the fact that this is all too strange, he
          doesn't mind, in a weird way, Adam is enjoying the attention.
                         
          He finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the
          stain.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Close your eyes and relax. Find a
           place inside yourself where you can
           escape the cancer.
                         
          Adam closes his eyes.

          Adam is seated at the dining table with his eyes closed.
                         
                          ADAM
           I can't believe you got me a
           present.
                          (BEAT)
           Is it that Prada handbag I've been

           RACHEL (O.S.)
           Even better.

           What is it?
                         
           RACHEL (O.S.)
           Keep your eyes closed.
                         
                          ADAM
           You know how I feel about
           surprises. Last surprise I got my
           parents told me I was adopted.
           39.
                         
                         
           RACHEL (O.S.)
           You're not adopted.

           No, you're right, it's not a good
           idea. Tomorrow I'll take him back
           where he'll be kept in a tiny cage
           with 10 other dogs who will bully
           him, and rape him, and then he'll
           eventually be euthanized.

           Really?
                         
                          GREG
           Man that was the worst.
                         
                          ADAM
           Your uncle had Schwannoma
           Neurofibrosarcomas.
                         
                          GREG
           Yeah, I think so. It's the thing
           with the toe and the screaming, and
           everything tastes like olives?
           Right?
                         
          Adam looks perplexed.
                         
                         
          INT. RACHEL'S CAR - LATER THE SAME NIGHT
                         
          Rachel and Adam drive home from the party. They're in
          completely different moods.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well that was a nightmare.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam, those people just threw you a
           party...They love you.
                         
                          ADAM
           Half those people don't even know
           me.
                         
          The car stops at a red light. Rachel looks at Adam. She finds
          his pouting adorable. He sees her staring,
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Nothing.
           46.

           What?
                         
                          RACHEL
           I love you.
                         
                          ADAM
           I love you.
                         
          Rachel takes Adam's hand.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Everything's going to be okay.
                         
          They look intensely into each others eyes and then kiss.

          Adam and Rachel make-out as they enter the house.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They make their way into the bedroom and clumsily undress one
          another. Adam looks at Rachel's naked body.
                         
                          ADAM
           You are so unbelievably sexy.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I'm totally yours,
                         
          Suddenly there's a loud scratching at the bedroom door,
          followed by a loud whimpering. Rachel stops.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           Noodle.
                         
                          ADAM
           What?
                         
                          RACHEL
           The dog.
                         
          Adam continues to kiss Rachel.
                         
                          ADAM
           Ignore him.

                          RACHEL
           I think he needs to go out.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'll do it after.
                         
          The two continue making out. The dog starts to bark.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I can't do this with him barking.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
                         
          Adam stands on the sidewalk impatiently waiting for the dog
          to do his business.
                         
                          ADAM
           (to the dog)
           Come on. Today...If I don't get
           laid tonight because of you, I'm
           going to take your little bow and
           make a noose...
                         
          The dog sniffs around, trying to find the perfect spot.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (PLEADING)
           Please! I need this.
                         
          ADAM'S NEIGHBOR walks by with A GIANT MASTIFF. He sees Adam
          yelling at the little Shi Tzu in ribbons. Adam looks up...
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Evening.
                         
                          NEIGHBOR
           Nice dog.
                         
          Once the neighbor is out of sight-
                         
                          ADAM
           Will you please just finish.
                         
          The dog finally finishes. Adam runs back into the house.
          After a minute, he realizes he left the dog in the street. He
          runs back after the dog, scoops him up and then runs back
          inside.
           48.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Adam fumbles around in the dark as he tears off his clothes.
          He then climbs back into bed, spoons Rachel, and begins
          seductively kissing her neck. He slowly moves his hand
          downwards. Rachel takes Adam's hand, pulls it up, and clasps
          it tight against her chest.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Hold me.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (UNDER BREATH)
           Mother fucker.
                         
          The two lay silently with Adam's arms wrapped around Rachel's
          body. A beat.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Do you...want to move in?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Do you want me to?
                         
                          ADAM
           I was thinking it might be nice,
           now that I'm not going to work
           anymore. And with my chemo
           starting...
                         
          Rachel turns to Adam.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           You're here all the time anyway.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (SMILES)
           Okay.
                         
          Rachel kisses Adam and lays her head on his chest.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (WHISPERS)
           You wanna have sex?

          EXT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MORNING
                         
          Edith's car whizzes down the street and peels into the Beth
          Israel Synagogue parking lot. The car comes to an abrupt stop
          as it parks in the last empty space.
                         
          Edith and Adam step out of the car and walk 20 feet before
          they realize Art is still in the car.
                         
                          EDITH
           Art come on.
                         
                          ART
           I'm coming.
                         
          Art, still in the car, doesn't move. Edith looks at her watch
          and walks back to the car.
                         
                          EDITH
           We're late.
                         
          Edith grabs Art's hand. He slowly gets out of the car.
                         
                         
          INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Edith, Art and Adam enter into the 600 seat synagogue. The
          service led by RABBI JACOBS (75) has already begun.
                         
          Edith spots three empty seats all the way in the left corner
          of the first row. Prime seats, but a bitch to get to since
          the service has begun - getting there would mean wading
          through a row of two dozen people. The USHER approaches.
                         
                          USHER
           Please take your seats.
                         
          The Usher motions for Edith and company to sit in the back.
                         
                          EDITH
           What about those seats up there in
           the front?
                         
                          USHER
           The service has begun.
                         
                          EDITH
           Please. My son has cancer.
                         
          Adam's jaw tightens, he can't believe his mother just did
          that. The Usher looks at Adam, sizing up the situation. Adam
          couldn't be more uncomfortable.
           50.

           Please, follow me.
                         
          The usher leads the group to the front and directs the people
          in the front row to let them pass through.
                         
          Edith apologizes as each person they pass has to stand to let
          them by.
                         
                          EDITH
                          (QUIETLY)
           Sorry, my son has cancer.
                         
          Adam smiles in embarrassment as he steps past.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (QUIETLY)

          INT. BETH ISRAEL SYNAGOGUE. ATRIUM - LATER
                         
          Edith and Art stand in a crowd of 600 congregants socializing
          and conversing after the service. ROSE (60) approaches.
                         
                          ROSE
                          (CONCERNED)
           Edith. How are you?
                         
                          EDITH
                          (OVERDRAMATIC)
           Oh Rose. Things are not well.
                         
                          ROSE
           I heard about the
                          (WHISPERS)
           cancer.
                         
                          EDITH
           I can't tell you how hard it's been
           on me. My only child. God only
           knows what terrible thing I did to
           deserve this. I've got a catatonic
           husband and a son with cancer. Not
           to mention my arthritis. I don't
           know how I'll ever get through it.
                         
          As Adam walks through the atrium, he notices everyone
          whispering and pointing at him.
                         
          Rabbi Jacobs (75) exits the bathroom, pulls up his fly and
          spots Adam. Jacobs has the face of a leather couch from all
          the tanning and face lifts. He spots Adam.
           51.

           Ladies and gentleman, Adam
           Schwartz!
                         
                          ADAM
           Rabbi Jacobs.
                         
                          RABBI
           How are you son?
                         
                          ADAM
           Oh you know, just trying to live by
           the Covenant.
                         
                          RABBI
           Don't bullshit me. You were the
           worst student I ever had. I bet
           you haven't even spoken a word of
           Hebrew since your Bar Mitzvah.
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't like to brag, but I
           couldn't speak it then.
                         
                          RABBI
           Your mother told me about your
           situation.
                         
          Adam looks over to see his mother surrounded by a dozen
          sympathetic listeners as she tells them her horror story of
          having a son with cancer.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm sure she did.
                         
                          RABBI
           It's not easy for a mother to see
           her son go through something like
           this,
                         
                          ADAM
           Nothing is easy for my mother.
                         
                          RABBI

           reconnect with the Torah?
                         
                          ADAM
           Honestly, I'm just here to make my
           mother happy. It was either this or
           I had to go see my cousin perform
           in his high school theatre's
           adaptation of "You've Got Mail".

           So you've been told you have
           cancer. Well, you're not alone. 1
           in every 3 people living today will
           experience some form of the
           disease...

           You may be wondering what is
           cancer? Well, cancer is a group of
           more than 100 different diseases
           characterized by the abnormal
           growth of cells. These cells form a
           lump or mass called a "tumor".

           Cancer is treated through the use
           of a revolutionizing medicine
           called Che-mo-therapy.

           It's important that you talk openly
           with your health care providers.

          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          A small group of patients, including Adam, have been watching
          the video. The people in the room applaud, Adam looks around
          baffled by both the video and the clapping.
                         
          GEORGE, a tall male nurse of Bahamian descent, enters the
          room.
                         
                          GEORGE
           Adam Schwartz.
                         
          Adam stands.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           Come with me my baby.
                         
          Adam follows George into the elevator where they ride down
          into the bowel of the hospital: The Cancer Ward.
                         
          Walking through the long ominous halls of the hospital
          basement, Adam passes dozens of sick patients who are being
          shuttled into Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy and other
          various treatment rooms.
                         
          A sick, fat, BALD ELDERLY WOMAN coughs as she passes. Adam
          winces in disgust.
                         
                          GEORGE (CONT'D)
           This way my baby.
                         
          George leads Adam into a Chemotherapy Treatment room.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. CHEMOTHERAPY ROOM - LATER
                         
          Adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked
          into a chemo drip. He's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless
          patients. He is the youngest patient by at least 20 years.
          Completely overwhelmed, Adam spots A BALD WOMAN sitting
          quietly knitting. She's at peace with herself. Her Zen like
          state helps Adam relax.
                         
          Adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for
          cancer patients until he notices HENRY (50), a very small man
          sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator.
          Despite the fact that every breath Henry takes looks like it
          might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall.
          Adam looks on in terror. The genial MITCH(85) notices.
                         
                          MITCH
           That's Henry.

                          ADAM
           Is he okay?
                         
                          MITCH
           He's always like that.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TERRIFIED)
           Is that going to happen to me?
                         
                          MITCH
           Best not worry about these things.
                         
          ALAN (84), the contentious old man sitting next to Mitch
          chimes in.
                         
                          ALAN
                          (TO ADAM)
           Want a hit?
                         
          Adam looks down to see that Alan is holding a ONE HITTER full
          of weed.
                         
                          MITCH
           It makes it all a little easier to
           handle.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (PARANOID)
           What if someone sees us?
                         
                          ALAN
           Don't be such an old man. Look at
           this place, it's like Death Row in
           here, they don't give a shit what
           we do.
                         
          Adam reluctantly takes a hit.
                         
                          MITCH
           How old are you?

           messing with you.

           out, then your balls will shrink.
           You'll marry a woman, or man,
           who'll suck every penny out of your
           savings and then leave you for a
           fitness instructor in a teal Miata.
           Then, to top it all off, your kids
           will one day stop talking to you
           because their therapist, who you
           pay for, tells them you're the
           reason they're so fucked up.
                         
                          MITCH

          Adam turns around to see a GIANT BALD FAT MAN eating cotton
          candy, his shirt reads "CANCER".
                         
          Adam tries to run away, but he's attached to the Giant Fat
          Bald Guy via an umbilical cord. The Giant Fat Bald Guy
          reaches out, picks Adam up, and swallows him.

          INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Adam jolts out of bed. His clothes are drenched in sweat. He
          looks down to see Rachel sleeping peacefully next to him. He
          quickly gets out of bed and runs into the bathroom. And by
          the sound of it, throws up. A lot. Rachel mutters something
          incoherent and then sprawls out, consuming the entire bed.

          Adam looks worn and exhausted from the chemo. He's never felt
          worse.
                         
                          KATIE
           So how do you feel after your first
           treatment?
                         
                          ADAM
           I feel like I was just gang raped
           by the Buena Vista Social Club.
                         
                          KATIE
           Is everything with you going to be
           a joke?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm serious. Have you heard their
           horn section?
                         
                          KATIE
           Adam, you have a responsibility to
           your mind and body.
                         
                          ADAM
           I was just injected with three
           pints of kryptonite. Can we please
           hold off on the new agey stuff.
                         
                          KATIE
           You can't just sit there and ignore
           what's happening to you...You need
           to stop bottling everything up.

                          ADAM
           What I need is for people to stop
           telling me what I need.
                         
                          KATIE
           Have you considered that this
           cancer is nature's way of telling
           you to change the way you live your
           life?
           (off Adam's look)
           ...There's an old saying - you
           can't change the wind, but you can
           adjust the sails.
                         
                          ADAM
           They teach you that in medical
           school?
                         
          Katie's patience is waning.
                         
                          KATIE
           I know you don't like to talk about
           your feelings, but you have to
           learn to find an outlet.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           An outlet for what? I have cancer.
                         
                          KATIE
           And how is your body ever going to
           fight the stress of that cancer if
           you can't even handle your own
           emotions?
                         
          Adam snaps, rasing his voice.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well excuse me. You'll have to
           forgive me for not having a firm
           handle on my emotions at this
           particular juncture of my life.
                         
          Katie's a little shaken by Adam's outburst. She stays firm.
                         
                          KATIE
           You don't have to be here.
                         
          Adam knows he went too far. Plus, that little outburst lifted
          a little wight off his shoulders, and he knows it.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm sorry, I know you're only
           trying to help.

                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           This is all too much for me. I
           don't know what to do. Just tell me
           what to do and I'll do it.
                         
          Katie looks at Adam, is he being for real? She's skeptical.
                         
                          KATIE
           I want you to do some homework.
           Here's a list of books on mind-body
           therapy. They should help you get
           started.
                         
          Katie hands Adam a sheet of paper with a list of books
          scribbled on it.

          Adam and Seth browse through shelves of books. Seth is
          reading the author's bio from one of the books on Katie's
          list.

          Seth ditches the New Age book and picks up one on Mardi Gras.

          From across the store, Seth notices, CLAIRE (30), an
          attractive employee stacking books.

           Art needs to breathe Adam!...Do
           whatever you want. I'm taking your
           dog to the park!...And open a
           window. This isn't a dorm room.
                         
          Rachel walks to the door, scoops the dog up in one arm and a
          bag of garbage in the other.

           fucking painting. Her art sucks.
           You don't want to put that on your
           wall. It looks like someone threw
           up a shrimp cocktail and then used
           it to spackle the Berlin Wall.

           your life you can do whatever you
           want. If you want to smoke weed,
           then smoke. You want a 50 inch flat
           screen TV, then get the fucking TV!
           And if you want to go to Mardi
           Gras, then LET'S GO TO MARDI GRAS!

          Seth takes a hit from the joint and hands it back to Adam.

          INT. LAUGHTER THERAPY - DAY
                         
          Adam and Seth are seated in a semi-circle with a half dozen
          middle aged men and women. At the front of the group is the
          LAUGHTER THERAPIST (50) - a short man with a long greying
          pony tail and a thick beard. All eyes are closed except for
          Seth and Adam's. Adam's hair is noticeably thin.
                         
                          LAUGHTER THERAPIST
           Good morning class. Before we begin
           I'd like to introduce Adam and
           Seth, our two newest giggle gurus.
                         
          The class laughs. Adam and Seth look around paranoid.
                         
                          SETH
           (quietly to Adam)
           What are they laughing at?
                         
                          ADAM
           (quietly to Seth)
           Just go with it.
                         
          Seth and Adam laugh along with the others.
                         
                          LAUGHTER THERAPIST
           (to Adam and Seth)
           Now what you'll soon discover is
           the true miracle and gift of
           laughter.

           Learning to laugh at ourselves and
           others through non- judgemental
           means is far more effective than
           any prescription drug, or,
           rehabilitation center.
           You see, when we laugh, our bodies
           release endorphins that not only
           support the immune system, but also
           release deeply stored emotional
           pain, and give us a fresh new
           outlook on life.
                         
          The Laugh Therapist opens his eyes and stares intensely at
          Adam and then Seth.
                         
           LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)
           We don't tell jokes here, we tell
           the truth - and we laugh at that
           truth.
                         
          The Laughter Therapist closes his eyes.
                         
           LAUGHTER THERAPIST (CONT'D)
           So let us share. Adam, why don't
           you tell us what brings you here?
                         
          Adam looks around in fear of saying the wrong thing.

           bow around it.
                          (TO ADAM)
           Honestly, I don't give a shit. You
           can do whatever you want. It's your
           life. All I know is that I'm not
           going to spend my last days on this
           miserable planet pining over a
           woman. The day my wife left me was
           the best day of my life.
                         
          Adam let's this soak in.
                         
                         
          EXT. HOSPITAL - AFTERNOON
                         
          Adam's on his cell phone pacing in front of the hospital.
                         
           RACHEL (V.O.)
           Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing
           something really important. I'll
           give you a call when I'm
           done...yay!
                         
                          ADAM
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Hey it's me, just checking to see
           if you're on your way.

          EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - LATER
                         
          Adam paces impatiently. He calls Rachel again, it goes
          straight to voice mail.
           71.

           Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing

                          ADAM
                          (INTO PHONE)
           It's me again. Just checking to see
           where you are. In case you're
           looking for me I'm now on the other
           side of the parking lot. Call me.
                         
          As Katie walks to her car, she sees Adam pacing and mumbling
          to himself.
                         
                          KATIE
           Adam?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Oh hey.
                         
                          KATIE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          ADAM
           Just waiting for Rachel to pick me
           up.
                         
                          KATIE
           What time is she coming?
                         
                          ADAM
           Uh, four.
                         
          Katie looks at her watch.
                         
                          KATIE
           It's six thirty.
                         
                          ADAM
           She must be stuck in traffic.
                         
                          KATIE
           You want a ride?
                         
                         
          INT. KATIE'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Adam is seated in the front seat as Katie drives. The car is
          filthy - it's littered with papers, magazines, food wrappers,
          etc. Katie's body is pressed all the way up against the
          steering wheel with her eyes fixed on the road.
           72.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
           Sorry about the mess.
                         
          Adam picks up a copy of "Organizing Your Way to Success,"
          which is lying on the floor.
                         
                          ADAM
           I think you should ask for a
           refund.
                         
                          KATIE
           I know, I know. What can I say? I'm
           not good at getting rid of things.
           I get easily attached.
                         
                          ADAM
           Yeah, I can see.
                         
          Changing the subject.
                         
                          KATIE
           So you don't drive?
                         
                          ADAM
           Nope.
                         
                          KATIE
           But you have a license?
                         
                          ADAM
           Nope.
                          (BEAT)
           I actually failed my test.
                         
                          KATIE
           No!
                         
                          ADAM
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           It's true.
                         
                          KATIE
           But, I thought you can re-take the
           test.
                         
                          ADAM
           Eh. Let's just say, that the state
           of California felt it was best I
           didn't.
                         
          Katie stares at Adam in shock.
                         
                          KATIE
           What did you do?
           73.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           I kind of backed my mom's car down
           an embankment...Into the Balboa
           cactus garden.
                         
                          KATIE
           The garden with all the endangered
           plants?
                         
                          ADAM
           They didn't want to tow it out in
           fear of destroying more of the
           vegetation, so they had to use a
           giant crane.
                         
          Katie lets out a tiny chuckle, but quickly contains herself.
                         
                          KATIE
           I'm sorry. That's terrible.
                         
          Unable to hold back, Katie continues laughing. This is the
          first time we've seen Katie let go of her rigid nature.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (ABRUPT)
           Stop the car.
                         
          Katie looks at Adam nervously.
                         
                          KATIE
           Why what's wrong?
                         
                          ADAM
           Just stop the car.
                         
          Katie stops the car. Adam grabs a handful of Katie's garbage
          and gets out.
                         
                          KATIE
           What are you doing?
                         
                          ADAM
           I can't handle all this mess.
                         
          Adam tosses the garbage in a dumpster and comes back to the
          car for more. Katie starts laughing, she can't believe Adam
          is cleaning her car.
                         
                          KATIE
           Wait, no, not that, that's my
           dinner.
                         
          Adam leaves Katie's dinner and throws out the rest of the
          garbage. He gets back in the car and takes a deep breath.
           74.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           You can drive.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER
                         
          Adam and Katie arrive at Adam's house.
                         
                          ADAM
           Thanks for the ride...
                         
          Adam looks at his house. The lights are out. He's really not
          in the mood to be alone. He looks back at Katie.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Do you want to come in. For a
           beverage? Or something?
                         
                          KATIE
           It probably wouldn't be very
           professional of me.
                         
                          ADAM
           Come on, I'll let you analyze my
           Id.
                         
          Katie is hesitant, but she also feels in a strange way that
          Adam is more than a patient.
                         
                          KATIE
           Uh, okay. But I can't stay long.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - LATER
                         
          Adam and Katie sit on the couch playing an ultra-violent
          video game. Katie is destroying Adam.
                         
                          KATIE
           You know you are terrible at this?
                         
          Adam is totally lost. He has zero sense of how to play.
                         
                          ADAM
           I've never played before.
                         
                          KATIE
           This is your Playstation.
                         
                          ADAM
           Doesn't mean I play it. Games these
           days today are so complicated.

                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           There's too many buttons. I can't
           keep track of what does what.
                         
                          KATIE
                          (LAUGHS)
           Perhaps you'd prefer something a
           little more simple. Maybe a nice
           game of Connect Four or Bingo.
                         
                          ADAM
           She has a sense of humor.
                         
          Katie's face lights up. She's proud of herself for that one.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Duck Hunt, now that was a game.
           You know why? One button.
                         
          Katie laughs.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           You think I'm kidding. My dad and I
           used to have Duck Hunt tournaments.
           He was actually really good.
                          (BEAT)
           Until he had his stroke.
                         
                          KATIE
           That must have been hard, seeing
           him lose his cognitive skills like
           that.
                         
          This is the most emotionally honest we've ever seen Adam.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well the funny thing is that the
           stroke actually made him a better
           player, he just lost interest.
                         
          Katie feels for Adam.
                         
                          KATIE
           You've never talked about your dad.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well whose fault is that? Doctor?
                         
                          KATIE
           Hey!
                         
          The two continue to play. Adam wildly pushes every button as
          Katie's character pins Adam's character and repeatedly slams
          his head into the ground.
           76.
                         
                         
          Game over.
                         
          Katie pats Adam on the shoulder.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Rematch?
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          Adam holds out a tray of wheat grass as he prepares to blend
          wheat grass shots.
                         
                          ADAM
           You ever had this stuff.
                         
                          KATIE
           No, but it's supposed to be really
           good for you.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well it smells like my grandmother.
                         
                          KATIE
           You complain a lot.
                         
                          ADAM
           You haven't met my mother.
           It's a miracle I do anything but
           complain.
                         
                          KATIE
           I try not to look at the world like
           that.
                         
                          ADAM
           The world would be a boring place
           if we didn't complain. Come on.
           There's got to be something. One
           thing, just one thing, that drives
           you nuts.
                         
                          KATIE
           Hmmm.
                          (FISHING)
           I really don't like it when people
           at work finish all the coffee and
           don't refill the pot.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's infuriating right?
           77.
                         
                         
                          KATIE
           I wouldn't say infuriating. It's
           just not good work place etiquette.
                         
          Adam is far more excited by this revelation. He hands Katie a
          shot of wheat grass and takes one last sniff of the awful
          smelling drink. He raises his glass to make a toast.
                         
                          ADAM
           To complaining.
                         
          Adam downs the drink and cringes at the taste. Katie follows,
          and in total disgust, she spits her wheat grass all over
          Adam's face.
                         
                          KATIE
           Oh god, that's disgusting. I'm so
           sorry.
                         
          Katie grabs a towel as Adam stands speechless.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           Hold on. I'm so sorry.
                         
          Adam keeps his eyes closed as Katie wipes his face.
                         
                          ADAM
           Is it all gone?
                         
          For the first time, Katie notices how cute Adam is. Adam
          opens his eyes to catch Katie staring at him. They lock eyes
          for a moment. Uncomfortable, Adam averts his look.
                         
          Suddenly, Rachel walks through the front door.
                         
           RACHEL (O.C.)
           Adam?
                         
          Feeling a little foolish, Katie motions to leave.
                         
                          KATIE
           I should probably be going.
                         
          Rachel enters the kitchen.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam?
                         
                          ADAM
           Finally. Where have you been?
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (MAD)
           I hope I'm not interrupting.

                          ADAM
           Oh, this is Dr. McRae, my
           therapist.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           This is your therapist?
                         
                          KATIE
           Please, call me Katie.
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           OK. Katie. What are you doing here?
                         
                          ADAM
           She drove me home. Ring a bell?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Ugh. Shit.
                          (SWEET/NERVOUS)
           Thank you so much for doing that.
           Life's been a little crazy lately,
           which I'm sure Adam has told you
           all about. I love those shoes.
                         
                          KATIE
           Thanks...
                         
          Awkward silence. The tension is thick.
                         
                          KATIE (CONT'D)
           I'm going to go. I'll see you at
           our next session Adam.
                         
          Katie leaves.

                          RACHEL
           I was at the gallery.

                          RACHEL
           I know. I'm sorry. I totally
           spaced. With the opening only three
           months away my head's just all over
           the place.

           Don't look at me like that. You
           know this is a hard time for me.
                         
                          ADAM
           You're right. Let me go back and
           talk to the doctor - see if maybe
           they can diagnose me with something
           that better suits your needs.

           And my house isn't a summer camp.
           You can't just come and go as you
           please and not take some
           responsibility.
                         
                          RACHEL
           And what is it that I'm not taking
           responsibility for?

                          RACHEL
           I can't handle this! You make it
           sound like I'm your wife.
                         
                          ADAM
           You know what I thought the other
           day? That I might actually die
           without ever having sex again.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I'm sorry if your cancer isn't
           turning me on.
                         
          Rachel begins to cry.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           You think this is easy for me
           seeing you sick like this? The past
           few months have been hard on me
           too. It's not always about you.

          INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME NIGHT
                         
          Rachel stares at Adam as he sleeps next to her in bed. She
          slowly moves her index finger along Adam's arm and then
          seductively kisses his neck. Adam firmly grabs hold of Rachel
          and the two begin to go through the motions. Clothes come
          off. Adam gets on top of Rachel...And then stops.
                         
                          RACHEL
           What's wrong?
                         
                          ADAM
           I can't.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Why?
                         
          Adam looks down.
                         
                          ADAM
           I don't know what's wrong.
                          (DEFEATED)
           It won't work.
                         
          Adam rolls over onto his back. He and Rachel lay silent -
          neither making contact with the other.

           Where's Alan?
                         
          Speechless, Mitch looks up at Adam and slowly shakes his
          head. Tears roll down Mitch's cheek. Adam's face goes white.

          A healthy Adam is surrounded by dozens of energetic elderly
          people who are swimming, playing bocci ball, shuffle board,
          bridge, etc. Adam looks on in confusion as an OLD MAN wearing
          an official looking badge drives by on a golf cart.
                         
                          ADAM
           Excuse me.
                         
          The old man stops his cart.

          The old man scratches his balls.
                         
                          OLD MAN
           Pretty great huh? They've even got
           a frozen yogurt machine.
                         
          The old man points to a long line of excited seniors awaiting
          their turn at a massive Frozen Yogurt Sundae Bar. A sign in
          front reads "WAIT: 45 MINUTES".

          Adam is seated in the Rabbi's office, he looks despondent.
                         
                          RABBI
           So you want to know what's going to
           happen when you die?
                         
                          ADAM
           I think it's a fair question.
                         
                          RABBI
           Fair yes, but impossible for me to
           answer. Our deaths, like our lives,
           have meaning and are all part of
           God's plan. How should I know what
           God has planned for you. Maybe if
           you came to service once in a
           while...
                         
                          ADAM
           Well am I going to go to Heaven?
                         
                          RABBI
           Probably.
                         
                          ADAM
           What if I want to just die? That's
           it. No Heaven.
                         
                          RABBI
           That's like buying a ticket for a
           cruise and then not going. The
           Afterlife is where the fun begins.

           How can being stuck in some
           nonexistent void with my
           grandparents be fun. I spent my
           entire life trying to get away from
           my family, now I'm going to have to
           spend an eternity with them.

           Adam, you can not look at death as
           a curse. Even in death we are all
           still part of God. Life on Earth is
           just the beginning.

           But that's not what I want.

                          (FRUSTRATED)
           Oy. Then find another religion. I
           don't make the rules.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL. KATIE'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Adam is lying on the couch staring at the ceiling. There is
          total silence.
                         
                          KATIE
           You're being awfully quiet today.
           Is everything okay?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm going to die aren't I?
                         
                          KATIE
           What are you talking about?
                         
                          ADAM
           It's true.
                         
                          KATIE
           We don't know that.
                         
          Adam sits up and looks at Katie.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm not getting any better.
                         
                          KATIE
           Don't say that, you're doing so
           well.
                         
                          ADAM
           Did you know that they found a
           Quasar 7 billion light years away?
           7 billion light years! It's more
           than 3 billion years older than our
           planet, and we're just seeing it
           now; and you think I'm going to
           live?
                         
                          KATIE
                          (TOTALLY BAFFLED)
           What are you talking about?
           84.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Cancer is an epidemic! It killed
           Alan, it's going to kill me, and
           it's going to kill millions more
           after me. There's nothing anybody
           can do.
                         
                          KATIE
           This is really good Adam. Let it
           out.
                         
                          ADAM
           Will you stop!
                          (BEAT)
           I can't do this anymore. It doesn't
           matter. None of it. I'm going to
           die and with nothing to show for my
           life. 100 years from now my legacy
           be will be that of just another
           person dead of cancer. That's it.
                         
                          KATIE
           This helplessness you're feeling is
           normal. These emotions you're
           holding onto are what make you
           human. But it doesn't mean you can
           just stop living your life.
                          (BEAT)
           Look at how you've grown over the
           past few months, you can't just
           throw it all away...Talk to me.
                         
                          ADAM
           I know you're only trying to help,
           but this isn't working for me
           anymore.
                          (BEAT)
           I'm sorry.
                         
          Adam leaves. Katie is left feeling as though she failed.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
                         
          Adam lies on the bed of an MRI machine. His body is slowly
          drawn into the enclosed body scanner.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S BATHROOM - MORNING
                         
          TIME LAPSE: Adam's stares at himself in the mirror. His
          health deteriorates even more.
                         
                         SUPER: NOVEMBER
           85.
                         
                         
          Looking at himself in the mirror, Adam takes note of his
          hollow cheeks and worn eyes. He looks awful, like an old man.
          There isn't any youth left. He's not getting any better, and
          he knows it.
                         
          Noticing a few renegade hairs sticking up, Adam pulls out a
          lint brush and combs his head.
                         
          Rachel enters and steps up on the scale. She examines herself
          in the mirror.
                         
                          ADAM
           I need a new lint brush.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Okay, I'll pick one up.
                         
                          ADAM
           And I have a doctor's appointment
           next Thursday...The big one.
                         
          Rachel continues to examines her waist.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Am I getting fat?
                         
          Adam stares at Rachel.
                         
                          RACHEL (CONT'D)
           What?
                         
                          ADAM
           Are you listening to me?
                         
                          RACHEL
                          (ANNOYED)
           Yes.
                         
                          ADAM
           So you'll take me?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Of course.
                         
          Rachel leaves. In frustration Adam weakly picks up the scale
          and throws it against the wall, smashing it.
                         
                          CUT TO:

          Adam sits alone in his empty house. It's a mess. He looks
          unhinged.
           86.
                         
                         
          He slowly pulls a hit from a joint as he watches Matlock on
          his flat screen TV, which has been moved to the floor to make
          room for Rachel's painting.
                         
          Adam flips the channel to Martha Stewart, then to I Love
          Lucy, then to General Hospital, then to Body Building on
          ESPN. He turns the TV off. He's bored.
                         
          Adam crosses to the answering machine. It reads "10
          Messages." He presses play. All the messages are from his
          mother. He hits delete.
                         
                         
          Adam reads through a stack of unopened letters. He comes
          across a postcard from the Museum advertising "Mountain Dew
          Presents: The Origins of Man".

          poster in the Museum's main entrance.
                         
          Adam enters the museum and walks up to the sign. People stop
          and stare, stunned by Adam's gaunt appearance - like a ghost
          haunting the grounds. Adam carries a wide smile, he's
          overcome with a sense of nostalgia for his old job.

          Seth leads a tour of FOREIGN TOURISTS through the museum. He
          speaks as he did earlier - like a game show host.
           88.

           And if you look over on your left
           you'll see our newest exhibit "The
           Last Days Pompeii." Buried in 79 AD
           by the catastrophic eruption of Mt.
           Vesuvius, Pompeii remained hidden
           and forgotten until 1748 when
           archeologists began to excavate the
           site. Here we see exquisitely
           preserved objects that offer a
           glimpse into the day-to-day life of
           this ancient city.
                         
          Seth comes upon Adam who is working closely on a diorama.
                         
                          SETH (CONT'D)
           This here is Adam, one of our
           curators. Adam do you want to tell
           us what you're working on?
                         
                          ADAM
                          (UPBEAT)
           Gladly. This here is a depiction of
           what Pompeii's final 19 hours
           probably looked like.
                         
          Adam's exhibit is a highly morbid depiction of Pompeii's
          final hours. The scene is total chaos. Ash flies through the
          air. Hot molten lava engulfs the town. Miniature men, women,
          and children run through the streets in horror. People are
          sacrificing whatever they can for the Gods. There's a wild
          orgy in the streets. And a giant TYRANNOSAURS REX model
          devours a villager.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           According to Pliny the Younger -
           "You could hear women lamenting,
           children crying, men shouting.
           There were some so afraid of death
           that they prayed for death. Many
           raised their hands to the gods, and
           even more believed that there were
           no gods any longer, and that this
           was one unending night for the
           world."
                         
          The tourists take pictures. In shock, Seth quickly shuttles
          the group away.

          Seth looks back at Adam like he's lost his mind.
                         
                         
          INT. MUSEUM. HALL - LATER
                         
          The sound of someone vomiting can be heard booming from the
          men's bathroom. A crowd of Museum guests walk past in horror.
          They look at each other in fear. The toilet flushes. Adam
          walks out. Everyone stares. Adam smiles in embarrassment.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (AWKWARD)
           I'll be in Pompeii if anyone needs
           me.
                         
          Adam walks back to the Pompeii exhibit. Phil approaches.
                         
                          PHIL
           You feeling okay? You don't look so
           good.
                         
                          ADAM
           Could be worse. Right?
                         
          Phil notices the Pompeii exhibit.
                         
                          PHIL
                          (STARTLED)
           Jesus!
                         
          Phil feels terrible about what he's going to say next.
                         
                          PHIL (CONT'D)
           Listen Adam...I don't know how to
           say this...
                         
          Phil places a comforting hand on Adam's shoulder.
                         
                          ADAM
           Don't worry...I get it. You're a
           good guy.
                         
                          PHIL
           Come back when you're better. You
           know you'll always have a home
           here.
                         
                         
          INT. MUSEUM. ORIGINS OF MAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Distraught, Adam walks down the Hall of Evolution. Slouched
          in defeat, he passes the various dioramas depicting human
          evolution. He begins at MODERN HUMANS and walks backwards in
          time.
           90.
                         
                         
          He comes to the family of Cro Magnons, then Neanderthal man.
          He stops and looks at Neanderthal - their slumped profiles
          match. He continues down the hall towards the exit.
                         
                         
          EXT. SAN DIEGO BOARDWALK - AFTERNOON
                         
          Adam walks along the boardwalk. He's surrounded by
          perfection. The beach. The water. The blue sky. Hundreds of
          beautiful men and women in their 20's and 30's: jogging,
          biking, surfing, skate boarding, playing volleyball, etc. He
          looks like a raisin among grapes.
                         
                         
          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY
                         
          Adam stands impatiently on his porch. He looks at his watch
          and then dials his phone.
                         
           RACHEL (V.O.)
           Hey, it's Rachel. I must be doing
           something really important. I'll
           give you a call when I'm
           done...yay!
                         
          Adam's face is red with fury. He does his best to hold back.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SWEET)
           Hey, it's Adam. Where are you?
           Maybe you forgot, but my
           appointment is today. So call me
           back.
                         
          Enraged, Adam hangs up.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Fuck!
                         
          Adam picks up his phone and dials again.
                         
           SETH (V.O.)
           Yoooooo.
                         
                          ADAM
           Hey man, I need you to do me -
                         
           SETH (V.O.)
           Not around. Leave a message.
                         
          Adam hangs up and dials again.
           91.
                         
                         
           EDITH (O.S.)
                          (YELLING)
           Hello,
                         
          Adam holds the phone away from his ear and cringes. A pang of
          regret runs through his body.
                         
                          ADAM
           Hi mom.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER
                         
          Edith, Art and Adam sit in the exam room, each reading their
          respective magazines - minus Art who is lost somewhere in his
          own world. The tension is thick. Edith looks at her watch and
          shivers. There's a knock at the door. A CUTE NURSE enters.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           The Doctor wanted me to apologize
           for running late, he's just in with
           another patient, but should be out
           in a few minutes. You guys holding
           up alright?
                         
                          EDITH
           It's very cold in here. Is there
           anyway you can turn down the Air
           Conditioning?
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           Unfortunately the temperature is
           controlled by a central thermostat.
                         
                          EDITH
           My son has cancer.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
                          (FEELS BAD)
           I'm sorry, really, if I could I
           would, but there's nothing I can
           do.
                         
          Adam's pissed that his mother has just involved him.
                         
                          ADAM
           (smiles to the Nurse)
           Don't worry about it.
           (Scowls at Edith)
           I'm fine.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           Are you sure? I could get you a
           blanket.
           92.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           No, really, I'm okay. But thank
           you.
                         
                          EDITH
           I'd love a blanket.
                         
                          ADAM
           (to the Cute Nurse)
           We're fine.
                         
                          CUTE NURSE
           Okay, but you let me know if you
           need anything.
                         
          The Nurse smiles at Adam in sympathy, he smiles back. The
          Cute Nurse exits.
                         
                          EDITH
           (Re: the cute nurse)
           I don't like her.
                         
          Edith puts her hand on Adam's forehead. He looks at her hand
          and then picks up a magazine in an attempt to ignore her.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           You feel warm.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm fine.
                         
          Edith pulls some pills out her fanny pack.
                         
                          EDITH
           Take these.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (ANNOYED)
           You're like some kind of deranged
           pusher.
                         
                          EDITH
           Do you know what it's like to fear
           losing your son? No. You don't.
           When you have children of your own
           we can discuss it. Now take the
           pills.
                         
          Adam puts the pills in his mouth and pretends to swallow.
          Edith gets up from her chair. As soon as his mother turns
          away, Adam spits the pills into his hand.
                         
          Edith paces around the room looking at the Doctor's various
          degrees on the wall.
           93.
                         
                         
          Adam looks on, annoyed at every step his mother takes. Edith
          closes in on one of the degrees and puts on her reading
          glasses for further examination.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
                          (DISAPPROVING)
           Huh.
                         
                          ADAM
           What?
                         
                          EDITH
           Oh nothing.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (ANNOYED)
           What?
                         
                          EDITH
           It's nothing, he went to a state
           college.
                         
                          ADAM
           You're unbelievable.
                         
                          EDITH
           I just worry that you're not
           getting the best care possible.
                         
          Adam can't take it anymore.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well who needs a doctor when
           they've got you and your fanny
           pack?
                         
                          EDITH
           You can be a little shit sometimes,
           you know that? You think I don't
           know what's best for you? I birthed
           you. You came out of me. I am your
           mother, for better or for worse, so
           accept it.
           (Re: fanny pack)
           You don't like this, well I'm
           sorry. It's my own way of caring.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SNAPS)
           Well stop! You're driving me crazy.
           With the comments and the pills
           every five minutes. Just stop. I'm
           not dad. I can take care of myself.
           94.
                         
                         
          Edith turns away, Adam's words hurt.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.
                         
          Edith blows her nose as tears rolls down her cheek.
                         
                          EDITH
           Yes you did. I drive you crazy.
                         
          Adam gently puts his hand on Edith's shoulder.
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom.
                         
          Edith turns to Adam helpless and scared.
                         
                          EDITH
           You're all I've got. Look at your
           father.
                         
          We see Art sitting in the chair picking his nose.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           I've lost him. My true love, gone.
           I'm never going see him again, at
           least not in this life.
                          (BEAT)
           He spent his whole life priding
           himself on his independence, always
           too stubborn to ask for help and
           now look at the son of a bitch.
                          (TO ART)
           You happy? You like shitting
           yourself?
                         
                          ADAM
           Mom!
                         
                          EDITH
           He was the greatest thing to ever
           happen to me. And then I had you,
           and that was even greater. So if I
           hover and threaten your
           independence, so what? You have a
           mother who loves you more than
           anything. Is that so awful?
                         
                          ADAM
           No. It's not.
                         
          Adam and Edith share a moment...Dr. Ross storms in the room
          carrying a stack of MRI films. He seems rushed.
           95.
                         
                         
           DR. ROSS
           Sorry to keep you folks waiting.
           It's been one of those days...car
           got towed. Wife double parked it.
                         
          Adam and Edith look at Dr Ross with blank stares.
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           Anyway I'll cut to the chase. The
           cancer's not responding to the
           chemo.
                         
          Dr. Ross places the MRI into the light box.
                         
           DR. ROSS (CONT'D)
           As you can see...The tumor is
           continuing to grow here, along the
           nerve.
                         
          Adam and Edith squint to see what Ross is talking about, but
          see nothing.
                         
                          ADAM
           So what do we do?
                         
           DR. ROSS
           We need to operate. If we don't
           remove it soon we risk metastasis.
                         
                          ADAM
           But you said surgery was too risky.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           We're out of options.
                         
          Tears roll down Edith's cheek. Adam grabs hold of her hand.
                         
                          EDITH
           But he's going to be okay, right?
           You're going to fix it.
                         
          Dr. Ross sits, he knows this can't be easy for a mother.
                         
           DR. ROSS
           This surgery is no guarantee. The
           risks are tremendous. And, even if
           we're able to remove the tumor
           there's still the chance that Adam,
           you'll never be able to walk again.
                         
          Adam looks at his mother. He firmly grabs hold of her hand.
           96.
                         
                         
                          ADAM
           Does that mean...I can get handicap
           parking?
                         
          Adam's line breaks the tension forcing a slight smile across
          Edith's face.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S HOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          Distraught and emotionally worn, Adam enters to discover the
          smell of a home cooked meal. He walks through the house.
                         
                         
          INT. ADAM'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
                         
          He stands in the doorway of the kitchen staring at Rachel
          cooking. Rachel turns around. She's in high spirits.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Hey you.
                         
          Rachel gleefully skips over and gives Adam a sweet kiss on
          the cheek.
                         
                          ADAM
           Smells good.
                         
                          RACHEL
           The girls and I are having a movie
           night. I somehow got suckered into
           cooking.
           (off Adam's look)
           Don't worry I left you some.
                         
          Adam feigns a smile, hiding the pain of his heart breaking in
          a thousand pieces.
                         
          Suddenly Rachel's iPhone VIBRATES. She picks it up, and reads
          her text message. Her face lights up as she reads. She
          quickly types a reply.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SUSPICIOUS)
           Who's that?
                         
                          RACHEL
           Susan. She wants to know what time
           I'm coming over.
                         
                          ADAM
           (even more suspicious)
           That's what she just texted?

                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           She wants to know what time you're
           going over to her house?
                         
          Rachel puts the phone down on the counter and returns to her
          cooking.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Uh huh.
                         
                          ADAM
           Alright, well I'm gonna go lie
           down.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I might be out late so don't wait
           up.
                         
          Adam walks to the bedroom. After a beat he moves back to the
          doorway and pops his head around the corner. He quietly
          watches Rachel cross from the kitchen into the living room.
                         
          He stealthily steps into the kitchen, picks Rachel's iPhone
          off the counter and scrolls through her text messages.
                         
                          ADAM

           What the fuck?
                         
          Rachel enters the kitchen.
                         
                          RACHEL
           What are you doing?

           (re: text message)
           He wants to know if you're still
           coming over tonight. Should I tell
           him you're having a girls night?
                          (CONTINUES READING)
           Oh wait, you already told him to
           bring the wine.
                          (LOOKS UP)
           That's funny. It seems as though
           you've double booked yourself.
                         
                          RACHEL
           I can't believe you just invaded my

           painted...
                         
          Rachel reaches for the phone. Adam pulls away.
                         
                          RACHEL

           He seems sweet.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam, it's not what you think.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well now how do you know what I'm

           Don't be like that. I didn't do
           anything wrong.

                          (SERIOUS)
           You've been cheating on me.
                         
                          RACHEL
           Adam you're being ridiculous.
                         
                          ADAM
           Am I?
                         
          Adam holds up Rachel's phone to display a photo of Rachel
          naked, covered in red paint.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           What's this?
                         
          Adam scrolls through an entire series of nude photos of
          Rachel - all ridiculously artistic.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           And this? And this? And this? There
           are over a dozen naked photos of

          Suddenly the back door swings open. Oblivious, Seth enters.
                         
                          SETH
           Hey guys.
                         
          Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth can tell he just walked
          into some major shit.
                         
                          SETH (CONT'D)
           Bad time?
                         
          Adam and Rachel say nothing. Seth takes a peak at Rachel's
          iPhone.
                         
                          SETH (CONT'D)

           I can see you're in the middle of
           something. I'll just be in the
           other room.
                         
          Seth crosses to the living room. Rachel picks up the
          conversation where they left off.
                         
                          RACHEL
           It's a portrait series, commenting
           on post-colonial patriarchy in the
           Congo.

           ...That's it. Nothing more.
                         
                          ADAM

           most important appointment of my
           life today and you missed it
           because you were off with your "art

          Rachel totally forgot about his appointment. The guilt runs
          through her body.

          Rachel stares at Adam with her adorable green eyes. She takes
          his hand.

          They embrace. A beat. Adam lets go. He looks Rachel in the
          eyes.

          Adam walks out the back door.
                         
          Seth enters the kitchen and gets in Rachel's face. He stares
          her down.

           Jen giving me a blow job?

           No, prom night. It feels like a
           lifetime ago... I know it happened,
           but that's it. It's like someone
           else's memory.
                         
          Adam stares out at the ocean. Reality check.
                         
                          SETH
           You okay?
                         
          Adam throws his beer bottle into the ocean.
                         
                          ADAM
           I can't believe this is all
           actually happening.

           It's some pretty fucked up shit.
                         
                          ADAM
           You know, I used to think that I
           was actually going to spend the
           rest of my life with
           Rachel...granted that might not be
           so far off.

           What a waste.
                         
          Seth puts his arm around him.

           I look like Powder.

           Then let's go get me laid.
                         
          Seth stands, and then stumbles. He's really drunk.
                         
                          ADAM
           I think I should drive.

           Driving! You care about driving! We

          The two get off the boat and climb into Seth's car.
                         
          Adam puts the key in the ignition. Without checking the
          mirrors, he backs the car up. BOOM the car slams into a giant
          statue of Neptune riding a sea horse.

           That's what the mirrors are for.
                         
          Adam pulls out of the parking lot.

           I know what I'm doing.
                         
          Adam turns left onto a one way street. It's the wrong way.

          An oncoming car honks and swerves out of the way - only
          nearly avoiding a head on collision.

           No. I'm driving and I want to go
           this way.
                         
          Another car swerves out of the way.

           wrong way? Big fucking deal.
                         
          Seth pulls the emergency brake. The car stops abruptly.

          Adam locks the doors and sits quietly for a moment. He then
          proceeds scream at the top of his lungs. 25 years worth of
          suppressed emotions come out.
                         
          Adam pulls out his cell phone. Seth notices. He tries to open
          the door. It's locked.

           who cares more about getting his

          Seth looks hurt. Adam holds the phone up to his head.

          Suddenly Adam passes out. His head slams into the steering
          wheel. The Horn blares.

          like it hasn't been cleaned in years. Adam scoops up some
          dust with his finger.
                         
          Seth is unusually quiet. Both guys are being distant. Seth
          pulls down the Murphy Bed and the two awkwardly avoid eye
          contact as they undress. Adam climbs into bed. He notices a
          book called "Coping with Your Loved One's Cancer" on Seth's
          bedside table. The book is worn and has multiple book marks -
          indicating it's been read. Adam looks at Seth, he had him
          pegged all wrong.
                         
          Seth claps his hands. The lights turn off.
                         
                          ADAM
           Good night.

           Night.
                         
          Lying in bed, Adam hears a strange noise, he tilts his head
          to the side to see Seth breathing heavily and staring at him.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (UNCOMFORTABLE)
           What are you doing?
                         
                          SETH
           Watching you sleep.

                          ADAM
           It's a little creepy.
                         
                          SETH
           I know. I can't help it.
                         
          Seth lays back on his pillow and holds onto Adam's hand. They
          both stare up at the ceiling - terrified about the future.

           Hi Adam, this is Richard Mathesson,
           your family's estate lawyer. Your
           mother asked me to call. We need to
           talk about potential, ah, well just
           call me, there are some potential
           arrangements we need to work out.

          Adam and Seth browse through racks of mens suits. Adam comes
          upon one he likes. The SALES CLERK approaches.

           You think this is a good suit to

           No, what you want is on level 3.

          A MORTICIAN, stout and dignified, with a slight British
          accent leads Adam and Seth on a tour of the cemetery grounds.
                         
                          MORTICIAN
           Here at Linden we're more than just
           a stopping ground for the deceased.
           We understand that life is
           different for everyone, and helping
           families to see their loved ones
           off to the hereafter means
           approaching every funeral and
           burial with it's own dignity and
           care...A funeral is a representation
           of the individuals time spent on
           earth, so I ask you to reflect on
           your inevitable interment and think
           carefully in choosing the service
           and tomb that best befits you.

           What about a Viking funeral?

           (talking out of his ass)
           You know, we put him on a boat...
           cover it with...dirt
           and...branches...whatever you can
           find. We push it out...into the
           sea...or the ocean...and then shoot
           flaming arrows, boom! It catches on
           fire...And that's it. It's awesome.
                         
          The Mortician stops and looks at Seth. He's not even going to
          dignify Seth with a reply. A beat.

          Adam and Seth look at the rows of Schwartz family tombstones.
          Up front is an empty gap, presumably where Adam and his
          parents are to go. Adam and Seth stare at the graves as we:

          INT. HOSPITAL PRE-OP ROOM - EARLY MORNING
                         
          Adam lies on a gurney. DR. LAMB, the neurosurgeon performing
          Adam's surgery enters. He's wired on Espresso. Behind him is
          NURSE WONG who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           Good morning Adam, how are you
           feeling? Good. Good. Good. Good.
                         
          Despite Dr. Lamb's already thick glasses, he holds Adam's
          medical chart right up to his to his face.
                         
           DR. LAMB (CONT'D)
           So we're going to be removing your
           kidney? Right? Or is it the left?
           Just kidding. That's doctor humor.
                         
          Adam forces a small chuckle. He's completely terrified.
                         
           DR. LAMB (CONT'D)
           Nurse Wong here needs you to sign a
           few papers, so I'm going to leave
           her to do her job, and I'll see you
           after the surgery.
                         
          Dr. Lamb exits. Nurse Wong hands Adam a giant pile of
          disclaimers to sign.
                         
                          ADAM
           What is all this?
                         
                          NURSE WONG
           Hospital liability and disclaimer
           forms...in case they need to fuse
           your spine or remove any organs.
           You know, the usual.
                         
                          ADAM
           Oh, great.

                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Glad to hear there's nothing
           unusual about removing organs.
                         
          Adam signs the documents and hands them back to Nurse Wong.
                         
                          NURSE WONG
           You have some visitors.
                         
          As Nurse Wong exits, Edith and Art enter.
                         
                          EDITH
           There he is.
                         
          Edith pulls a strip of pills out of her fanny pack. She hands
          them to Adam like she's slipping him illegal drugs.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
           Here take these. They're special. I
           got them from Canada.
                         
          Adam looks closely at the pills - they read "NUPRIN."
                         
                          ADAM
                          (PERPLEXED)
           Mom, this is Nuprin.
                         
                          EDITH
           I know isn't it great?
                         
          Adam looks at his mother, perplexed by her logic.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (SHRUGS)
           What the hell.
                         
          Adam downs the pills. Art whispers closely into his ear.
                         
                          ART
           I gotta new coat.
                         
                          ADAM
           That's great dad.
                         
                          ART
           Brooks Brothers. Silk pockets.
           Feel.
                         
          Adam sticks his hand inside the pocket of Art's coat.
                         
                          ART (CONT'D)
           Feel.

          Art grabs hold of Adam's hand and stares at his son. A beat.
                         
                          ART
           I love you son.
                         
                          ADAM
           I love you too dad.
                         
          Katie knocks on the door.
                         
                          KATIE
           Hello?
                         
          Katie slowly enters holding a bouquet of flowers. Edith
          examines her. This is too awkward.
                         
                          ADAM
           Egh em. Mom. Mom.
                         
          Adam nods for his mother to leave.
                         
                          EDITH
           Alright. Come on Art, let's go to
           the waiting room.
                         
          On her way out, Edith turns to Katie and notices a CROSS
          around her neck.
                         
                          EDITH (CONT'D)
                          (DISPLEASED)
           Hmmm.
                         
          Edith and Art exit. Adam is left alone with Katie. They're
          both nervous.
                         
                          KATIE
           I brought you flowers. Not sure
           why, I didn't know what else-
                         
                          ADAM
           They're great, thank you.
                         
          Katie sits on the bed next to Adam.
                         
                          KATIE
           So how you doing?
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm a little freaked out.
                         
          A small GERMAN ANESTHESIOLOGIST enters. There is something
          incredibly unsettling about her thick accent.

                          ANESTHESIOLOGIST
           Hello Adam, I am the
           Anesthesiologist. I will give you
           shot to make you sleep.
                         
          Adam holds Katie's hand.
                         
                          ADAM
           Will you be here when I wake up?
                         
                          KATIE
           I'm not going anywhere.
                         
                          ANESTHESIOLOGIST
           Now relax, this will take a few
           minutes to feel the effect.
                         
          The Anesthesiologist injects the drugs into Adam's IV.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TERRIFIED)

                          ANESTHESIOLOGIST
           Relax, you will soon begin the
           sleeping.
                         
                          ADAM
           Well what if it doesn't work. How
           do you know I won't wake in the
           middle of the surgery? What if I-
                         
          Just like that, Adam's out cold.

          Adam is face down on the operating table. Two Neurosurgeons,
          Dr. Lamb and DR. HENRY are in mid surgery. Alongside the two
          doctors are Nurse Wong and NURSE SCOTT.
                         
           DR. HENRY
           I'm telling you Sir Francis Drake
           was a Buccaneer.

           No he was a privateer.
                         
                          NURSE SCOTT
           I thought he was a pirate.

           A pirate works for no one but
           himself. A privateer has a mandate
           from a government.
                         
           DR. HENRY
           I thought that was a buccaneer.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           No, a buccaneer is a butcher turned
           pirate.

           We were successful in the
           extraction of the tumor. However,
           as you can imagine, with something
           of this magnitude...there were some
           unforeseen complications. The bone
           corrosion was much greater than
           initially anticipated. We had to
           remove part of the hip and pelvis,
           as well as most of the psoas
           muscle. We also had to remove a
           good amount of sheath tissue around
           the sciatic nerve, the damage to
           that nerve is considerable, which
           is going to hinder his ability to
           walk...He's in stable condition
           right now, but it's touch and go.

          Adam's in his hospital bed - still asleep from the surgery. A
          NURSE comes in to change his IV. Adam slowly awakens. He is
          high on morphine. He stares, mesmerized by the nurse.
                         
                          ADAM
           That is the most beautiful dresses.
           Where did you get it?
                         
          Dr. Lamb enters.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           Adam, I see you're awake.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm here.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           How are you feeling?
                         
                          ADAM
           I feel wonderful.
                         
           DR. LAMB
           That would be the morphine.
                         
          Dr. Lamb picks up a handle that's attached to the morphine
          drip and sticks it in Adam's hand.
                         
           DR. LAMB (CONT'D)
           I want you to push this little
           button any time you feel pain.
           It'll trigger the morphine. You
           think you can do that?
                         
          Adam moves his hands really slowly in the air -
                         
                          ADAM
           Magic!
                         
          Art and Edith enter the room. Adam reacts like a little kid
          being picked up from pre-school.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Mommy! Daddy!

                          ADAM
           Remember the time you walked in on
           me masturbating?...That was so
           awkward...What hotel is this? We
           need to go on more vacations.
                         
          Katie pops her head out from behind Adam's parents.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           You're here too! You're soooooo
           awesome...

           Rae...I'd love to make you pancakes
           sometime.
                         
          Suddenly the most excruciating pain runs through Adam's body
          causing him to scream in agony.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! PAIN!

           Squeeze the morphine trigger!
                         
          Adam squeezes the trigger. The morphine offers immediate
          relief. He lays back in total bliss, and then...
                         
                         
          FADE OUT TO WHITE LIGHT.

                         SUPER: NOVEMBER
                         
          A door bell. A hand reaches out. A finger on that hand pushes
          the door bell. The other hand holds a bouquet of flowers.
                         
          The hand belongs to Mitch's wife, MARGARET (80). She stands
          on the porch of a small beach bungalow.
                         
          The front door opens. Margaret looks straight ahead. Nothing.
          She then looks down, startled by Adam in a wheelchair.
                         
                          MARGARET
                          (STARTLED)
           Oh, hello, I didn't see you, ah
           down there.
                         
          There's a glow in Adam's face - he looks younger and more
          jovial than we've ever seen.
           117.

           You must be Margaret.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Yes, I'm looking for Adam Schwartz.
                         
                          ADAM
           That's me.
                         
                          MARGARET
           (face lights up)
           You're Adam? The way Mitch
           described you, I always assumed you
           to be much older. About 50 years
           older. But, you're just a baby...
                         
          Adam blushes.
                         
                          ADAM
           I'm so glad you could make it.
                          (SOLEMN)
           I'm really sorry about Mitch.
                         
                          MARGARET
           Me too.
                         
                          ADAM
           Please come inside. You're just in
           time.
                         
          Adam leads Margaret inside, past a dozen oversized boxes.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Sorry about the mess. I just moved
           in...The ocean air is supposed to
           be good for my recovery.

          Adam and Margaret enter the living room. Everyone's there:
          Edith, Art, Katie and Seth.
                         
          Seth and Katie are playing a video game: DUCK HUNT. Edith
          sets food on the table.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TO MARGARET)
           We're having a Duck Hunt
           tournament. You play?

                          (LAUGHS)
           Me? Oh I don't know how to play
           video games.
                         
          Adam holds up the controller - an old Nintendo Gun.
                         
                          ADAM
           It's really easy. One button does
           everything.
                         
          Edith chimes in from across the room.
                         
                          EDITH
           This food's not going to eat
           itself.
                         
          Everyone makes their way to the table. Visibly weak, Adam
          slowly lifts himself out of the wheelchair. He yelps in pain.
          Katie starts to help when Seth intervenes.
                         
                          SETH
           I got it.
                         
          Seth grabs hold of Adam, and with his help, Adam takes a
          small step and then lowers himself into his seat at the
          table. Katie places a pillow behind Adam's back.
                         
          Adam takes Katie's hand, she looks down at him, they exchange
          a smile.
                         
          Adam notices and open window.
                         
                          ADAM
                          (TO SETH)
           You mind?
                         
          Seth ignores Adam as he fills both their plates with food.
                         
                          ADAM (CONT'D)
           Please. I think there's a red tide
           or something. My eyes are all
           itchy. It feels like someone is
           rubbing sandpaper on my corneas.
                         
                          SETH
           (as he serves Adam)
           Nope. You don't have cancer
           anymore. No more special treatment.
                         
                          ADAM
           I am still in remission.

           You gonna spend the rest of your

                          (PROUD)
           I like complaining.
                         
          We FREEZE on the family sitting around the dinner table.
                         
          We hear the song "That's the Way The World Goes Round" by

          For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a
          park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says
          a word.
          
          
          CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No
          words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants
          to be looked at.
          
          A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.

          The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular
          conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up
          sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-
          shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to
          balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

                    This belief stemmed from early
                    exposure to sad British pop music
                    and a total misreading of the
                    movie, "The Graduate."

                    Since the disintegration of her
                    parents' marriage, she'd only loved
                    two things. The first was her long
                    blonde hair.
          
          She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.

                    Sure they do. They say that.
          
                              TOM
                    Well they're wrong. It's not true.
                    I've fished in that sea. I've
                    jumped in and swam in that sea! I'm

                        (to Rachel)
                    Sorry. What I mean is... there are
                    no other fish. This was my fish.

                    Now I know this may be a little
                    risque...but if New Hampshire

                    conservative, right-wing neo-Nazis
                    at Hallmark, maybe playing it safe
                    is the wrong approach. The nuclear
                    family is dead and we need a new
                    holiday to recognize that.

          The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of
          the department.

                    Hmmm. That's an intriguing idea
                    McKenzie. Along with Grossman's
                    "Magellan Day" I'd say we've got
                    some potential here. What do you
                    think Hansen? Could you write up
                    some prototypes for these?

          And in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom
          hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from
          that moment on, he can't take them off her.

          The office sings "Happy Birthday" to a FEMALE CO-WORKER. When
          they get to the part about her name, Tom is the only one who
          knows it, everyone else just there for the cake. Song over,
          everyone digs in. Tom finds himself standing next to Summer.

                    I'm happy. Still getting situated.
                    How long have you worked here?

          Really? Jesus. Did you always want
          to write greeting cards?
          
                     TOM
          Are you nuts? I don't even want to
          do it now.
          
                    SUMMER
          What is it you want to do?
          
                    TOM
          I studied to be an architect
          actually.
          
                    SUMMER
          That's so cool! What happened?
          
                    TOM
          Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved
          to the city to work for a company.
          Company went under. Needed a job.
          My friend worked here. Got me this.
          
                    SUMMER
          And are you any good?

          It's a big seller.

          I meant, are you any good as an
          architect?
          
                    TOM
          Oh... No. I doubt it.
          
                    SUMMER
          Well, I'd say you're a perfectly
          ...adequate... greeting card
          writer.
          
                                                                  19.

                    Why thank you. That's what they
                    called me in college. "Perfectly
                    adequate" Hansen.

                    I was very neat and organized.
          
          There's an awkward silence.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Anyway, I should get back.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok, well, I'll see you around.
          
          She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall.
          Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored.
          
          He sits down at his desk and sets out to work. But before he
          does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house. It's
          dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall.

                    Ok...
          
                              AMANDA
                    I press the skip button.
          
          Still Tom doesn't understand.
          
                              TOM
                    What does this have to do with--?
          
                              AMANDA
                    I'd rather listen to something
                    else.
          
          And with that, it slowly sinks in for him.
          
                              TOM
                    But Amanda... this is a great
                    fucking song!

          Tom removes his headphones and sits defeated with McKenzie
          and Paul in a booth.

                    What?

                    No. But it could have been. In a
                    world where good things happen to
                    me.

                    Yeah well, that's not really where
                    we live.
          
                                TOM
                    No.

                    So what happened?

                    So there we are. All alone. Nine
                    more floors to ride. Plenty of
                    time. I figure...this is my chance.
                    If not now when, right?
          
          They ride in silence for a few beats.

                    I think I missed something.
          
                               TOM
                    "It was good." She didn't say "It
                    was good." She said "It was good."
                    Emphasis on the good. She basically
                    said "I spent the weekend having
                    sex with this guy I met at the
                    gym." Fucking whore. Screw her.

                    She's not interested in me. There's
                    nothing I can do.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Based on..."it was good?"
                              TOM
                    And some other things.
          
                              PAUL
                    Like what, she said "hey" instead
                    of "hi" cause that totally means
                    she's a lesbian.
          
                              TOM
                    I gave her all sorts of chances.

          The office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom
          and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put
          a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's "I
          Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner. No reaction from
          Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down,
          defeated.
          
          
          INT SUMMER'S DESK
          
          Tom is there.
          
                              TOM
                    Do you want to go out with me?
          
          A beat. Summer says nothing.
          
                              TOM
                    And the Priest says, "But we're
                    already out!"
          
          They both laugh.
          
                              SUMMER
                    That is hilarious!

                    I know!
          
          And when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with
          his palm.

          with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard
          time concentrating.

                    Not at all. You just threw up on
                    the stage, tried to fight the
                    bartender, and then threatened to
                    burn the place down before passing
                    out on the sidewalk. Quiet night
                    for you.

                    won't be like that. The whole

                    I really can't. Even if I wanted
                    to. There's a lot of stuff I gotta
                    take care of.

                              MCKENZIE
                    The whole office is going.
          Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on
          him...
          
          
          INT KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
          
          Summer is in a back booth with some co-workers when Tom walks
          in to the crowded place. McKenzie has the microphone and he's
          singing "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison. He's real into
          it and, well, it's kinda sad. Tom waves to McKenzie and walks
          over to the booth.
          
                              TOM
                    Hi.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Hey! They said you weren't coming.
          
                               TOM
                    You asked if I was coming?
                        (BEAT)
                    I mean...my plans got cancelled...
          
          Tom is at a loss. There's yet another awkward silent beat
          between them. Thankfully, it's interrupted by...
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (already drunk)
                    Goddamn that song is brilliant!
                    What's up Hansen?
          
          Summer sees the next song come up on the screen.
          
                                                                  30.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ooh that's me.
          
          She downs a shot and jumps up on stage.
          
                               SUMMER
                        (into mic)
                    Ok. I'm the new girl so no making
                    fun of me.
          
          Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep
          breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and
          Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in
          whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's
          something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a
          midget in a tuxedo.)
          
          LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as
          Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can't help
          but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles,
          hopeful that she'll come over. She doesn't. He hides his
          disappointment.
          
          LATER. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is
          there in mid-conversation with McKenzie.
          
                              TOM
                    You were great up there, by the
                    way.

                    I hear that.
          
                              MCKENZIE

                    Jersey?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah?
          
                              TOM
                    Lived there til I was 12.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I named my cat after Springsteen.
          
                              TOM
                    No kidding? What's his name?
          
                                                                  31.
          
          
          
                               SUMMER
                    Bruce.
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    That makes sense.
          
          She laughs. She's really cute when she laughs.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So you got a boyfriend?
          
                               SUMMER
                    Me? No.
          
          Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie
          mouths "what?" Summer sees nothing.
          
                               MCKENZIE
                    Why not?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Don't really want one.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Come on. I don't believe that.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You don't believe a woman could
                    enjoy being free and independent?
          
                               MCKENZIE
                        (BEAT)
                    Are you a lesbian?
          
                              SUMMER
                    No, I'm not a lesbian. I'm just not
                    comfortable being somebody's
                    "girlfriend." I don't want to be
                    anybody's anything, you know?
                              MCKENZIE
                    I have no idea what you're talking
                    about.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It sounds selfish, I know, but... I
                    just like being on my own.
                    Relationships are messy and
                    feelings are always getting hurt.
                    Who needs all that? We're young.
                    We're in one of the most beautiful
                    cities in the world.

                              SUMMER (cont'd)
                    I say, let's have as much fun as we
                    can afford and leave the serious
                    shit for later.
          
                              TOM
                    But...what if you meet someone and
                    fall in love?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (LAUGHS)
                    Love? You seriously believe in that
                    stuff?
          
                              TOM
                    Of course I do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Interesting. A real romantic.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Oh you have no idea. This one...
                    embarrassing. There was this one
                    girl,
                        (to Tom)
                    I gotta tell this story --
          
          Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer, hold on... you don't
                    believe in love?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I don't even know what that word
                    means. I know I've never felt it,
                    whatever it is in all those songs.
                    And I know that today most
                    marriages end in divorce. Like my
                    parents.
          
                              TOM
                    Well mine too but --
          
                              SUMMER
                    Oh yeah, And I read in Newsweek,
                    there were these scientists who
                    found that by stimulating a part of
                    the brain with electrodes you can
                    make a person fall in "love" with a
                    rock. Is that the love you're
                    talking about?
          
                              TOM
                    Well...
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    Why, what's your take on it?
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY
          DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN
          ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO.
          
                                                           BACK TO:
          
          
          INT BAR
          
          On Tom:
          
                              TOM
                    I think it's...kind of a huge
                    thing.
          
                               SUMMER
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok. Looks like we're gonna have to
                    agree to disagree on that one.
          
          McKenzie senses some discontent.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So, uh, who's singing next?
          
                              SUMMER
                        (re: singing)
                    I'd say it's your turn loverboy.
          
                              TOM
                    Nooo. I don't sing in public.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sure you do. I see you lip-synching
                    to your headphones every morning on
                    your way in.
          
                                 TOM
                    I don't...
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    You really do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It's ok. I like it. Takes a lot of
                    self-confidence to look ridiculous.
          
                                                                  34.
          
          
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (can't help himself)
                    Self-confidence! Ha!
          
          Tom elbows him in the ribs again.
          
                              TOM
                    Anyway, I'm not near drunk enough
                    to sing in front of all these
                    people.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok then. Let's drink.
          
                              TOM
                    It would take at least ten shots to
                    get me to sing.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Bartender!
          
          TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's
          "Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK
          STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in
          the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts.
          It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.
          
          LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming
          something.
          
                              TOM
                    That's not it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    What is that then?
          
                              TOM
                    I have no idea.
          
          They're both having a good time.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I used to watch it every week.
          
                              TOM
                    Me too. Why can't we think of the
                    stupid A-Team theme song.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Pathetic.
          
                              TOM
                    This is gonna bother me for weeks.
          
                                                                  35.
          
          
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Totally.
          
          They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good
          way.
          
          ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to
          Be an American." He really means it. At any minute he might
          start to cry.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    "And I'd proudly stand UP!"
                        (aggressive drunk)
                    I said stand!
          
          BACK ON TOM and SUMMER.
          
                              TOM
                    Oh here we go.
          
          
          EXT KARAOKE BAR - LATER
          
          Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place. Summer
          is with them.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                        (to Summer)
                    This guy.
                        (DRAMATICALLY)
                    He's the best.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok, let's get you in a cab.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    No. I'm gonna walk. I live right
                    down that street. Or that one.
          
                              SUMMER
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Is he gonna be ok?
          
                              TOM
                    He'll be fine.
          
          A cab arrives. Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside.
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                    Hey.
          
                                 TOM
                    What's up?
          
                                                                    36.
          
          
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Not you. You.
                        (beat, to Summer)
                    He likes you.
          
                              TOM
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Ok, goodnight McKenzie!
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    I mean... likes you, likes you. For
                    real. Tell her Tom.
          
          Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's
          just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and
          erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry you had to see that. Happens
                    every time we come here. It's
                    unbelievable. Something about that
                    guy and singing for people. I don't
                    know. But at least he didn't --
          
                              SUMMER
                    Is that true?
          
                              TOM
                    What?
          
                              SUMMER
                    You know what. Do you...like me?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. I like you. Of course I do.
          
                              SUMMER
                    As a friend.
          
                              TOM
                    Right. As a friend.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Just as a friend?
          
          The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right
          answer here?
          
                              TOM
                    Yes. I mean... I haven't really
                    thought about... Yes. Why?
          
                                                                     37.
          
          
          
                               SUMMER
                     Nothing. I just... You're
                     interesting. I'd like us to be
                     friends. Is that ok?
          
          Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He
          hides his disappointment the best he can.
          
                               TOM
                     Oh yeah totally. Friends. You and
                     me. That's... perfect.
          
                               SUMMER
                     Cool.
          
                               TOM
                     Cool.
          
          Silence.
          
                               SUMMER
                     Well, I'm that way. Good night Tom.
          
                               TOM
                     G'night Summer.
          
          Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go
          the other way.
          
                               TOM
                         (under his breath)
                     Friends. Awesome. That's just
                     great. Well done Hansen, you idiot.
          
          Tom walks a few more steps.
          
          And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even
          noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED
          HIM INTO A KISS!
          
          It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure
          if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out
          of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually
          happening.

          FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          
          
          EXT STREET - MORNING
          
          It's the greatest morning of all time!
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts
          down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,
          winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out
          his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.
          
          People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.
          A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the
          HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody
          loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom
          singing the song.
          
          Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also
          pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last
          night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up
          every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".
          
          CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at
          them.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - SAME
          
          Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees
          him and immediately lights up.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Hey!
          
                                 TOM
                    Hey!
          
          Vance pokes out of his corner office.
          
                              VANCE.
                    Summer, I need -- Oh hello Hansen.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey Mr. Vance.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yes, Mr. Vance?
          
          And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer
          gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make
          anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal
          for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.
          Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          
          
          INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT
          
          Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs).
          
                              PAUL
                    You son of a bitch.
          
          He walks inside without waiting for an invite.
          
                              PAUL
                    Last night, karaoke night?
          
                              TOM
                        (ANXIOUS)
                    Shhh.
          
                               PAUL
                    The same girl you'd been whining
                    and crying and bitching about for
                    weeks now?
          
                              TOM
                    I have not been...
          
                              PAUL
                    The same girl you said was way out
                    of your league and you'd have no
                    chance with no matter what. That
                    girl?
          
                              TOM
                    Paul, seriously...
          
                              PAUL
                    Did you bang her?
          
                                TOM
                    No!
          
                                PAUL
                    Blow job?
          
                                TOM
                    No!
          
                                PAUL
                    Hand job?
          
                              TOM
                    No, Paul, no jobs. I'm still
                    unemployed. We just kissed.
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    Come on, level with me. As your
                    best friend, who tolerated a whole
                    month of talk talk talk about this
                    girl, nothing but Summer this,
                    Summer that, Summer Summer Summer,
                    I mean you were practically
                    stalking her...
          
                               TOM
                    Shhh!
          
          Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the
          bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out.
          
                               PAUL
                    Oh crap.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Hi, I'm Summer..
          
                              PAUL
                    Summer, wow what an unusual name.
                    I'm sure I'd remember that if I had
                    heard it before. Tom, how come
                    you've never mentioned you knew
                    such a lovely little lady?
                        (off Tom's nasty look)
                    Or perhaps you have and I've just
                    forgot.
                        (to Summer)
                    I mean, with all the women in Tom's
                    life it's hard to keep track...
                        (not helping)
                    Ok, well, I was just... I'm Paul.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Hi Paul.
          
                              PAUL
                        (not sure what else to
                         SAY)
                    I'm a doctor.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Nice to meet you.
          
                              PAUL
                    Anyway, I'm leaving now. Pretend I
                    was never here. Tom, talk to you
                    later?... Hey, If any jobs open
                    up...
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
          
          Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul.
          
                              TOM
                    If you heard...
          
                              SUMMER
                    Heard what?
          
                              TOM
                    Excellent. You ready to go.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm stalking, STARVING!
          
          Tom realizes she's heard it all.
          
                              TOM
                        (PLAYFULLY)
                    He exaggerates!

          INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much. At another
          table, Tom sees a VERY UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE feeding each other
          food.
          
                              TOM
                    Check them out.
          
          Summer sees. She has no reaction.
          
                              TOM
                        (SARCASTIC)
                    That is hot.
          
          Summer keeps eating.
          
                              TOM
                    I am very turned on right now.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sometimes you can be so judgmental.
          
                                 TOM
                    Huh?
          
                                                                  42.

                    I mean, who are you? They're happy.
                    Just mind your own business.
          
          Summer goes back to eating. Tom can't believe she snapped.

          An equally UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE go at it in a booth. PAN
          ACROSS to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in
          a booth across the room, watching in hysterics.

                              SUMMER
                    Too soon to say. It's all in the
                    dismount.
          
                              TOM
                    If we're lucky, there won't be a
                    dismount.
          
          Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it
          again. They are having a great night.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't believe them. I have like
                    zero patience for PDA.
          
                              TOM
                    I hear ya. If I want to watch
                    people make out, I have big windows
                    and binoculars at home.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah?
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    No. That would be wrong.
          
          They laugh some more. She is in hysterics.
          
                              SUMMER
                    This is fun. You're fun.

                    front, I'm not looking for anything
                    serious.
          
          Tom is a little surprised.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Are you cool with that?
          
                              TOM
                        (UNCONVINCING)
                    Sure.
          
                              SUMMER
                    It freaks some guys out when I say
                    that.
          
                              TOM
                        (still confused)
                    Not me.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Let's just have fun. Let's
                    just...hang out, no pressure, no
                    labels, no obligations.
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok?
          
          Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it.
          
                              TOM
                    Sure.

                    Wanna hold my hand under the table?
          
          A beat.
          
                              TOM

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
          Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each
          other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other.
          Suddenly, Tom stops.
          
                                                                    44.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    I'll be...back in a sec.
          
          He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into
          the hallway mirror.
          
                              TOM
                    Settle. Don't get too excited.
                    She's just a girl. There's lots of
                    them. Who look like that. And like
                    what you like. They're everywhere.
                    Calm yourself.
          
          He takes a few deep breaths.
          
                               TOM
                    Are you calm?
                        (BEAT)
                    Ok. Then it's time to go back in.
          
          We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where
          Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked.
          
                              SUMMER

          Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance.

          LATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to

          painting of two dogs humping. He stops and retrieves it from
          the bin like it's some family heirloom. He gives the
          secretary a dirty look for tossing it.

                    church. The beauty of St. Patrick's
                    is its humility. With this giant

          Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of
          her arm. Tom thinks about this. Then he starts to draw a
          sketch on her skin. We catch her watching his face as he
          draws. She's attracted to his enthusiasm.

          without a word and leaves.

          Tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him.
          The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet.

          We just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes
          behind it. Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the
          shower. They're trying to stable themselves, grip something
          so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess.

                    Ow!
          
          The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall
          on top of each other laughing.

                    Cause nobody loves Ringo.

                    Is she your girlfriend?

                    I wouldn't say that.

                    What would you say?

                    Like, are we "going steady?" Come
                    on, guys. We're adults.

                    It's not an unreasonable question.

                    No I do not. In fact girls are
                    repulsed by me. Paul, how about
                    you?

                    girlfriend type. You're gonna need
                    to discuss it.

                              TOM
                    My thinking is... why rock the
                    boat? Things are going well. If we
                    start putting labels on it, that's
                    like the kiss of death. Like saying
                    to a girl "I love you."

                    ask the question, `are we
                    boyfriend/girlfriend?' You're just
                    afraid you'll get an answer you
                    don't want and that will shatter
                    your illusions of how good
                    everything's been these past few
                    months. Is that about right?

                    to get the wrong answer now... or
                    find out in a month she has a date

                    something.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:
          
                                SUMMER
                    Wait!
          
          Summer finds on the radio a particular song. ("Waiting in
          Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know.)
          
                               SUMMER
                    Whoa. Oh my god. We can't talk
                    during this song. It's too
                    beautiful.
          
          And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers
          there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches
          Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the
          way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain
          notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry
          at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply
          overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this
          girl.
          
                                                                    57.
          
          
          
          Marley sings:
          
                              B.M.
                    "In life I know there's lots of
                    grief/ but your love is my relief."
          
          We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.

          INT PARTY - NIGHT
          
          Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.
          TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with,
          drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom
          notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's
          clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention
          they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that
          attention.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          (272-286)
          INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY
          
          Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders
          through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the
          titles. He grabs just about every one of them.
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his
          bed. He reads from one called "Six Steps to Getting Over
          Him."
          
                              TOM (V.O.)
                    "So he broke your heart. You've
                    been sad and depressed for weeks.
                    Perhaps you've turned to drinking
                    or even drugs. And nothing's
                    helped. Now what? Should you binge
                    on rocky road and watch soaps all
                    day?"
          
          SECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He
          continues to read.
          
                                                                     58.
          
          
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "No you should not."
          
          He slowly puts the ice cream down.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Through extensive research, we
                      have found the six most effective
                      ways to get over that lost love and
                      make room in your heart for a new
                      man to fill. Those steps are:"
          
          
          EXT. STREET - DAY
          
          Tom jogs.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "One. Exercise. The body's release
                      of endorphins will assuage the
                      brain and provide a genuine sense
                      of accomplishment and success."
          
          Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child
          on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in
          place.
          
          
          INT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT
          
          Tom is taking a yoga class.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Two. Physical and Mental
                      relaxation. Channel all of your
                      energies to the core of your being
                      for a new understanding of the self
                      and others."
          
          This shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as
          Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't
          even get the breathing right.
          
          
          INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY
          
          Tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the
          homeless.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Three. Charity. Reach out! You are
                      not alone in your pain."
          
                                                                  59.
          
          
          
          Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits
          immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.
          
          
          INT SHOE STORE - DAY
          
          Tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Four. Shoe Shopping! Ladies...you
                      know you want to. Indulge!"
          
          ANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't
          really want new shoes.
          
          
          EXT. FOREST - DAY
          
          Tom backpacks alone in the forest.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Five. Travel. Take some time to
                      see another environment. Get
                      perspective. It's a beautiful
                      world. It will be for you again
                      someday."
          
          This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to
          the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and
          takes a deep breath.
          
          FREEZE ON TOM.
          
          INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that
          Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a
          step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up
          behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER
          has Tom sized up in his rifle sight.
          
          UNFREEZE.
          
          Tom starts to itch...
          
          
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment.
          
                                TOM (V.O.)
                      "Six. Redecorate. Start anew."
          
          He's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.
          
                                                                    60.
          
          
          
                              TOM (V.O.)
                    "By taking these few steps, you
                    will have discovered your inner
                    strength and should be ready to
                    move on. I bet you can hardly
                    remember his face at all."
          
          We pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of
          Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and
          dropkicks it.

          Summer and Tom stand by the bar.
          
                              TOM
                    I just don't get women's fashion
                    nowadays. Everybody with the
                    tattoos, the giant hoop earrings,
                    those annoying hats. Explain this
                    to me.

                    People think it looks good.
          
                               TOM
                    Do you?

                    On some.
          
                              TOM
                    I like how you dress.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah? What if I started wearing
                    berets and got a huge butterfly
                    tattoo on my leg?

          A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly
          appeared next to them.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          
                                 DOUCHE
                           (to Summer)
                    Hey.
          
          Tom and Summer stop talking.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Hey.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    How's it going?
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange
          go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more
          amused than concerned.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    You live around here?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah not too far.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    I've never seen you here before.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You're not too perceptive.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Ha. That's funny.
          
          Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry
          about.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    So, uh, let me buy you a drink.
          
                              SUMMER
                    No thank you.
          
          As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The
          Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of
          them together.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Are you with this guy?
          
          Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.
          
                                                                     62.
          
          
          
                               TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    Hi. I'm Tom.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    Whatever.
                        (to Summer)
                    Come on, one drink. What are you
                    drinking?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Sorry, no thank you.
          
          Tom is pleased.
          
                              DOUCHE
                    You're serious? This guy?
          
          And now he's pissed.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey buddy --
          
                               SUMMER
                        (to the Douche)
                    Don't be rude. I'm flattered, I'm
                    just not interested. Now why don't
                    you go back over there and leave us
                    alone, ok?
          
                              DOUCHE
                    It's a free country.
          
          Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now
          what?" After a beat:
          
                              DOUCHE
                    So you and him, huh? I can't
                    believe that. Is this guy really
                    your boyfriend?
          
          And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to
          cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,
          coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the
          woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost
          automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.
          
          Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.
          
          Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's
          fist).
          
                                                                  63.
          
          
          
          There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.
          And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          
          Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is
          a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it.
          
                              TOM
                    Did you see that punch? I don't
                    know where it came from. I haven't
                    punched someone since Josh
                    Greenberg in fifth grade. Guess I'm
                    gonna have to throw out this shirt.
          
          Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first
          time she's furious.
          
                              TOM
                    Hey. What is it?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't believe you.
          
                              TOM
                    What?
          
                              SUMMER
                    You were so completely uncool in
                    there.
          
                              TOM
                    You're mad at me? I just got my ass
                    kicked for you.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Oh that was for me? You were, what,
                    protecting me? Next time Tommy,
                    don't. I fight my own battles.
          
                              TOM
                    Come on, that guy was an asshole!
          
                              SUMMER
                    You didn't have to hit him. Why
                    didn't you just let me handle it?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know. He was --
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    See. This is why I don't want a
                    serious relationship.
          
                              TOM
                    Whoa. What was that?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Nothing. Look, I like you Tom. I
                    like this. What we've been doing.
                    But maybe it's gone too...
          
                                TOM
                    What...?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I told you all along what I don't
                    want and it's...
          
          Tom waits for more. It doesn't come.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm tired. Can we talk about this
                    tomorrow?
          
          It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think.
          Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.
          
                              TOM
                        (calling to her)
                    I just got my ass kicked!
          
          Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this.
          
                              TOM
                        (to Onlookers)
                    I got one good shot in.

          INT. OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose.
          Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops
          short.

                    What's up?
          
                                   SUMMER
                    Nothing.
          
                                   TOM
                    Ok.
          
          Nothing else is said.
          
                              TOM
                    Wait, are you still mad at me?

                              TOM
                    Holy shit you are. I can't believe
                    you!

                    Are you almost done?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah. I'm all done.
          
          He starts to walk out.
          
                              TOM
                    You know what... Sometimes you
                    really don't make any sense.
          
          Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she
          looks back at him, he's gone.
          
          LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk.
          She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but
          she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there.
          
          LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle
          but he's already gone.

          Left: Tom picks up the phone. Is about to dial when he stops
          himself and hangs up.
          
          Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It
          doesn't.
          
          
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER
          
          Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the "sleep" button but
          the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He
          gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Say you're sorry.
          
                               TOM
                    Huh?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Say you're sorry for acting like a
                    jerk.
          
                              TOM
                    I am. I'm sorry for acting like a
                    jerk.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok. Me too.
          
                              TOM
                    Summer... we don't have to label
                    what we're doing. I just... I need -
          
                               SUMMER
                    I know -
          
                              TOM
                    Consistency. I need to know you
                    won't wake up tomorrow and feel a
                    different way.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can't promise you that. Nobody
                    can. Anyone who does is a liar.
          
          A beat.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I can only tell you how I feel
                    right now... or I can show you.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
          
          She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second.
          Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins
          again. He shuts the door in our faces.
          
          
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
          
          Tom and Summer in the wee hours.

                    Have you ever had a real
                    "boyfriend?"
          
                                 SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    A boyfriend. "Going steady."
                    Whatever. You know what I mean.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well... yeah.
          
                              TOM
                    More than one?
          
                                 SUMMER
                    A few.
          
                              TOM
                    Tell me about them.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Oh no way.
          
                                 TOM
                    Why?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Cause there's nothing to tell.
          
                              TOM
                    Come on, I'm interested.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You wanna have the relationship

                    Yes.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You sure about that?
          
                                                                    68.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    No. Yeah. I don't know. Why not? I
                    can take it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok. Well, in high school, there was
                    Markus.

                              SUMMER
                    He was a rower. Very hot.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened to Markus?
          
                              SUMMER
                    He works for the Republican party.
                    Very successful. Just not for me.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok. And then?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Well, for a short time in college,
                    there was Kurt.
          
          INSERT: Still photograph of KURT. As Tom envisions him.
          Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue.

                    That didn't really go anywhere.

                    Yeah, cause, you know...
          
          Tom has no idea. And he doesn't want to know.

                    The ones that lasted.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened? Why didn't they work

                              SUMMER
                    Nothing happened really. It's what
                    always happens. Life.
          
          On TOM. Silent for a few beats. Did he want to hear that?

          Tom, unshaven, un-showered, walks by himself. He turns a
          corner and sees Summer walking towards him. As she gets
          closer he sees it's not her after all and breathes a sigh of
          relief.
          
          
          INT. BEDROOM - LATER

          could swear the actress was Summer.

          Tom and an attractive girl we haven't seen before walk
          towards an outdoor cafe. Her name is ALLISON. It's clear
          right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already.
          
                                                          70.
          
          
          
                              ALISON
                    So how long have you known Paul and
                    Robyn?
          
                              TOM
                    Since grade school.
          
                              ALISON
                    No way, really? That's crazy.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah.
          
                              ALISON
                    Well I'm glad you called. They
                    spoke very highly of you.
          
                              TOM
                    Great.

                    So...uh... how's it going?

                    Ok.
          
          Beat.
          
                              ALISON
                    You've been pretty quiet.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry.
          
                              ALISON
                    I'm pretty quiet too. Usually. It's
                    nice sometimes to be comfortable
                    enough that you can just sit and
                    eat and not have to say anything,
                    you know?
          
                              TOM
                    Uh-huh.
          
          More silence.
          
                              ALISON
                    Do you want to try some --
          
                                                                     71.

                    No thanks.
          
          Alison looks at her food. Tom realizes he's been difficult,
          starts to feel kinda bad.
          
                               TOM
                    I'm sorry. It's just... there's
                    this girl.
          
                                 ALISON
                    Oh.
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not usually like this. I wasn't
                    before... Long story short, she
                    wrecked me. I don't know if you can
                    tell but it was pretty recent and
                    I'm still kinda thinking about her.
          
                              ALISON
                        (DISAPPOINTED)
                    Well maybe you should think
                    about... someone else... who could
                    cheer you up.
          
                              TOM
                    I can't get her out of my head, you
                    know? I see her everywhere. She's
                    all I think about. And it's
                    horrible. Cause I totally didn't
                    see it coming. I thought things
                    were fine. So now I keep going
                    through every day in my mind, every
                    second really. Wondering. What went
                    wrong? Is it my fault? Could I have
                    prevented it somehow?
          
          
          EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - (BACK ON DAY 51)
          
          Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the
          buildings.
          
                              TOM
                    A lot of people have problems with
                    this, but to me, it makes both
                    structures so much more beautiful
                    side by side like that.
          
          Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the
          CAMERA.
          
                                                                  72.

                    While you continue to talk about
                    buildings and whatever other
                    bullshit interests you, I'll just
                    nod my head and pretend to listen
                    while secretly dreaming about the
                    many ways I can one day rip out
                    your heart and eat it like the
                    rabid vampire I am.

          From the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together.
          He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had
          in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored
          and unfulfilled.

                    she was never that interested in me
                    to begin with.

                    Anyway... sorry. If I'm acting
                    strange, that's why.
          
                              ALISON
                    It's ok. I'm sure it's tough
                    getting over an ex-girlfriend.
          
                              TOM
                    Actually she was never my
                    girlfriend.
          
          Now Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part
          where Tom starts totally cracking up.
          
                              TOM
                    I just... I thought I'd have
                    figured it out by now, you know? My
                    life. Where I'm going, where I want
                    to end up, who with. All that
                    stuff. I still don't know anything.
                    And the thing is... When I was with
                    Summer, none of that mattered. I
                    never even noticed how much of my
                    life was missing! Isn't that weird?
          
                              ALISON
                    You were in love, that's what it
                    does. But, now that you know where
                    the holes are you can start to fill

          He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He
          brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and
          plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into
          the mirror.
          
          Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.

                      I kinda like what Nietzsche said:
                      "There is always some madness in
                      love, but there is also...always
                      some reason in madness." Think
                      about it. Pretty smart. Although,
                      Nietzsche also said "Kill the
                      Jews." So there's that.

                    Mom, Martin, this is Summer.

          And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices

                    Is this the girlfriend?

                    Well this is the girl friend I've
                    told you about. I don't know if
                    "girlfriend" is the right word...
          
                              SARAH

                    Great! Should we save you seats?
          
          Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for
          Summer.

                                                                  82.
          
          
          
                              SARAH
                    Ok. We'll see you inside.
          
          When they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is
          distraught.
          
                              TOM
                    Sorry about that.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    It's fine.
          
                              TOM
                    You wanna go do something else? We
                    can totally bolt.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Did you tell them I was your
                    girlfriend?
          
                              TOM
                    What?! No way... I never used that
                    word.
          
                              SUMMER
                    They seemed to think... I mean, why
                    is your step-dad giving me a hug?
          
                              TOM
                    He's very...loving.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Does he hug all your friends?
          
          There's that word again.
          
          Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at
          him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the
          theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as
          ever. Why is none of this easy?
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
          
          Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold,
          emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact,
          something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her
          head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.
          
          ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          
          It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen
          assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets
          fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away
          like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent,
          horrible on-screen death.
          
          
          (228)
          INT CLUB - NIGHT
          
          Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking
          miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not
          really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with
          everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with
          sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You're not having any fun.
          
                              TOM
                    You're having enough for both of
                    us.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm dancing. I haven't danced in
                    ages. God. Come on.
          
                              TOM
                    No.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Come on! I wanna dance with you.
          
                              TOM
                    Where were you an hour ago? I might
                    have danced then. I've been
                    standing here by myself this whole
                    time and you didn't look over once.
          
                              SUMMER
                    So you're pissed?
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not pissed. Summer... you know
                    I hate this shit.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Then why are you here?
          
                                                                     84.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    This is what you wanted to do
                    so...we're doing it.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Yeah well, I didn't need a
                    chaperone. Go home. You're a
                    buzzkill standing there pouting.
          
                               TOM
                        (HURT)
                    That's real nice.
          
          He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second.
          
                                 SUMMER
                    Tom!
          
          But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and
          starts dancing again.
          
          LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the
          music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is
          alone. He can't believe it's come to this.
          
          
          (251)
          FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.
          
          
          EXT STREET - MORNING
          
          The worst morning ever.
          
          Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks
          down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,
          broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still
          Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.
          He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's
          brother Clint looks back.
          
          Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.
          
          He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He
          doesn't even stop.
          
          Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.
          
          The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for
          directions. He doesn't even look up.
          
                                                                  85.
          
          
          
          Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all
          of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.
          The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom
          tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - SAME
          
          He passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there.
          He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends
          up just staring into space.
          
          
          INT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY
          
          Tom has been called into the Principal's office.
          
                              TOM
                    You wanted to see me, Mr. Vance?

                    A death in the family, someone

                              TOM
                    No.

                    Look, I don't mean to pry. Does
                    this have something to do with
                    Summer leaving.
          
                              TOM
                    Who?

                    your work performance has been... a
                    little off.
          
                              TOM
                    I'm not following.

                              TOM
                    Ok. Well, I'm sorry. Things for me
                    have been a little difficult.
          
                              VANCE
                    That's ok. I understand that. I was
                    just thinking... perhaps you could
                    channel your energy into... this.
          
          He hands him some sympathy cards.
          
                              TOM
                    Funerals and sympathy?

          He quickly ushers him out of the office.
          
                                                                  87.

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - MORNING
          
          Tom wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls
          onto the floor and begins a brief push-up routine.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    Most days of the year are entirely
                    unremarkable. They begin and they
                    end without creating a single
                    lasting memory. Most days have no
                    real impact on the course of a
                    life.
          
          The phone rings. Tom stops his push-ups to answer it.

                    May 8th was a Saturday.
          
          
          INT DELI - DAY
          
          Tom walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table. They look
          extremely nervous.
          
                              TOM
                    What's going on?
          
          Neither one answers him. They look at each other. Finally...
          
                              PAUL
                    We have news.
          
                              TOM
                    Ok.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    It's about her.
          
                              TOM
                    Do I want to hear it?
          
                              PAUL
                    Thats what we wanted to ask you.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    It's just...lately you've
                    been...better.
          
                                                                  88.
          
          
          
                              PAUL
                    You've been much much better.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    So maybe it's best we don't ever
                    bring her up again.
          
                              PAUL
                    Just let sleeping dogs lie.
          
                              MCKENZIE
                    Leave those dogs alone Tom!
          
                              TOM
                    You guys, look, I'm... I appreciate
                    what you're saying and, thank you,
                    really, for putting up with me
                    these past few months. I've been
                    crazy. But I've accepted the fact
                    that she and I were just two very
                    different people who wanted very
                    different things. I wanted to get
                    serious. Shit, I loved her. And I
                    know now, she just isn't the kind
                    of girl who can settle down with
                    one person and be happy. The way I
                    wanted. And she probably never
                    will. There was nothing I could do.
          
          Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than
          ever. On Tom, we:

          Tom comes charging out of the place with his friends
          following behind.

                    There's no fucking way!

                    It can't be. It's impossible!

          INT TOM'S BEDROOM
          
          Tom is going apeshit in his room. He's ripping down posters,
          taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He
          punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He
          tries to find something to kick and can't. He throws his cell
          phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.

          INT SUPERMARKET - DAY
          
          Tom, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes,
          Jack Daniels, and twinkies.
          
          The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.
          
          
          EXT STREET - SAME
          
          Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees
          ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees
          a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.
          
                                                                  90.

          They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.

          Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He
          probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to
          the alarm.
          
          
          INT OFFICE - LATER
          
          Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the
          clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't
          muster responses. At his desk,
          
                                 MCKENZIE
                     Tom!
          
          Nothing.

                     I've been calling every five
                     minutes. Are you ok?

                     What? Oh yeah. Great.

          INT BOARDROOM - LATER
          
          Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his
          usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.
          
          A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in
          mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do
          with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up
          for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    This one says "Go for it!"
          
          She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    This one says "Don't give up!"
          
          Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."
          
                              CO-WORKER
                    And this one says "You can do it!"
                    We have a whole line of
                    inspirational cards featuring
                    Pickles, my cat. I think people
                    will really enjoy them. Thank you.

                    Good job Rhoda, I agree. Really
                    inspirational stuff. Now, who's
                    next. We haven't heard from

                    This isn't inspirational. It's
                    suicidal. He tries that jump, I'm
                    writing a sympathy card for that
                    cat. That's the last thing I want
                    to be doing with my life. It's bad

                    Yes but think about it! Why do
                    people buy these things? Not to say
                    how they feel. There's paper and
                    pens for that. People give these
                    cards when they can't say how they
                    feel. Or they're afraid to. And we
                    provide the service that lets `em
                    get away with that!
          
          Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing
          uncomfortable.

                    I say to hell with it! Let's level

                    has passed." What the hell? Let's
                    give em some truth. Something like,
                    "Sorry to hear about your
                    grandmother. Here's a card so I get
                    some credit in your time of need.
                    I'm sure it makes up for the fact
                    that grandma's dead."

                    I think we do a bad thing here.
                    People should be able to say how
                    they feel, how they really feel,
                    without some strangers putting
                    words in their mouths. The truth. A
                    card is a nice thought but it
                    shouldn't do the dirty work for
                    you. You love someone, tell them
                    yourself, in your own words. Maybe
                    it's not love at all. Maybe there's
                    no such thing as love. Maybe
                    it's... "galoogoo."

                    Yeah I made it up, so what?!
          
          Tom gets up and walks to the door.

                    It's all crap. We make and peddle
                    crap. And sometimes people believe
                    in this crap. I just can't do it
                    anymore, Mr. Vance. There's enough
                    bullshit in the world without my
                    help. I quit.

          And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty
          stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It
          doesn't really take.

          Tom comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front of
          the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I just
          do that?!" And then we,

                    We know.
          
                              TOM
                    But... It's May! We broke up last

                               TOM
                    And you said she was single at

                    It's insane.
          
                              TOM
                    It's impossible. It doesn't make
                    sense. Where did they meet? Is it
                    someone we know?

                    So everything she said. All that
                    stuff about... it can't be. Not
                    her. I know her too well. She
                    wouldn't do that.

                    No I'm serious.
          
                              TOM
                    I got news for you Rach. That true
                    love stuff... it's make-believe.
          
                              RACHEL
                    Well that's not very romantic.
          
                              TOM
                    It's the new me.
          
          The song ends.
          
                              TOM
                    Alright... go play with your
                    friends.
          
                              RACHEL
                    You'll be ok?
          
                              TOM

                    Sure.

                    Tom.
          
                              TOM
                    Hmm?
          
                               RACHEL
                    I know you think she was the
                    perfect girl for you...
                        (BEAT)
                    I don't. I think you're just
                    remembering the good stuff. But
                    what do I know, right? I'm 13.
          
                                                                    102.
          
          
          
          She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls.
          Tom watches her go.

          Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting
          his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear.
          
                                TOM
                    Hey.
          
          Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her
          side and she angles towards it.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Hello?
          
                              TOM
                    Are you still sleeping?

                              TOM
                    10:30. Are we still hanging out
                    today?
          
                                SUMMER
                    Ok. Sure.

                    I'll meet you at Liberty in... 20
                    minutes?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I might need 45.
          
          
          EXT PARK - DAY
          
          Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar,
          it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful
          day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it
          all, finally, fell apart.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    So how was last night?
          
                              SUMMER
                    It was fine. Just a work thing.
          
                              TOM
                    Where did you guys go?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Some restaurant.
          
                              TOM
                    Fun?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Uneventful. Didn't get home until
                    after 12 though which is way too
                    late for a stupid work function.
                    How was your night?
          
                              TOM
                    Pretty standard.
          
          Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of
          silence.
          
          
          EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were
          looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we
          might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the
          aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's
          distant. But only if we're really looking.
          
          
          (406)
          INT. APARTMENT - LATER
          
          Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment
          again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.
          
          LATER. He hangs some new pictures.
          
          LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.
          Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He
          draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail
          something.
          
                                                                   104.

          INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER
          
          That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper.
          Summer reads a novel.
          
                              TOM
                    It's playing at 5.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You want to go?
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know. You wanna maybe go
                    back to your place or ---
          
                              SUMMER
                    I want to see it. Let's go.
          
                               TOM
                    Ok cool.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Unless you don't want to.
          
                              TOM
                    No, I will. That's fine.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.
          
          
          INT MOVIE - LATER
          
          Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in
          Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to
          look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to
          be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.
          
          
          (409)
          INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.
          
                                                                 105.
          
          
          
          And then he stops.
          
          He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.
          He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.
          From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to
          form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,
          almost shaped like a tear drop.
          
          
          (240)
          EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER
          
          Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's
          alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after
          that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.
          
                                 TOM
                       Hey.
          
          He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs
          back.
          
                                 TOM
                       Hey Sum, it's just a movie.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       I know. I'm sorry Tom.
          
                                 TOM
                       Is everything alright with you?
          
          She smiles, tries to pull herself together.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Yeah. I'm just...I'm sorry. I'm
                       being ridiculous.
          
                                 TOM
                       It's ok. This happens to me every
                       time I watch "Hoosiers." Let's go
                       for a walk, ok. Let's get some air.
                       Or go to Sister Ray's.
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Ok.
          
          They walk.
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          
          
          INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT
          
          Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.
          He grabs one.
          
                               TOM
                    It pains me that we live in a world
                    where no one's ever heard of
                    Spearmint.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I've never heard of them.
          
                              TOM
                    And it's painful. Oh look.
          
          He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as
          we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down
          the aisles.
          
          In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.
          It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand
          approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it
          at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if
          there's something to read in that.
          
          
          (411)
          EXT HARBOR - DAY
          
          Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the
          works. He's in the zone.
          
          
          (240)

          Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.

                    So.
          
                              TOM
                    So... Now what?
          
                                                                 107.

                    Now...I think I'm gonna call it a
                    day.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah? You wanna maybe...get some
                    dinner or something?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I've got pasta at home.
          
                              TOM
                    Are you hungry?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I'm pretty hungry, but --
          
                                TOM
                    Ooh!
          
                                SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    I've got a great idea!
          
                                SUMMER
                    What?
          
                              TOM
                    Let's get breakfast.
          
                                SUMMER
                    Now?
          
                                TOM
                    Pancakes?
          
          Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is
          history.

          Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          
          LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we
          first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while
          holding a phone with the other.
          
          
          2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY
          
          Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the
          city's skyline.
          
          2. INT LIBRARY - DAY
          
          Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,
          reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building
          design.
          
          
          3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY
          
          Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the
          lobby of a high-rise.
          
          
          4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY
          
          Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing
          soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.
          
          
          6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY
          
          Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on
          his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of
          futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and
          Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also
          crossed off.
          
          
          5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY
          
          Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring
          the distance between the beams of the bridge.
          
          8. EXT PARK - DAY
          
          Tom jogs. A little faster this time.
          
          9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,
          crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He
          sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost
          in thought.
          
                                                                    109.
          
          
          Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,
          he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.
          
          
          9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY
          
          On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.
          Thinking.
          
          On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is
          lifted. And she's a bride.
          
          END MUSIC.
          
          
          (478)
          EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY
          
          Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal
          interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In
          the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took
          Summer ages ago.
          
          
          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost
          in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.
          
                                 SUMMER (V.O.)
                       Hey.
          
          Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She
          may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.
          Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to
          do.
          
                                 SUMMER
                           (re: suit)
                       Where you coming from?
          
                                 TOM
                       What? Oh. Nowhere. How long have
                       you been sitting there?
          
                                 SUMMER
                       Awhile.
          
          Tom finds it hard to look at her.
          
                                                                   110.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    I come here a lot. I always loved
                    this place, ever since you brought
                    me here.
          
          The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.
          
                              TOM
                    So... I should probably say
                    congratulations.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Probably. But only if you mean it.
          
                              TOM
                    I don't know if I do honestly.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I understand.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah well...anyway...I hope you're
                    happy.
          
                              SUMMER
                    You really do?
          
                                 TOM
                        (BEAT)
                    God no.
          
          They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.
          
                              SUMMER
                    How are you, Tom?
          
                              TOM
                    I'm good. Ish.
          
                              SUMMER
                    That's good.
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah I quit the office.
          
                               SUMMER
                    Really? That's great! What are you
                    doing now?
          
                              TOM
                    Mostly...sleeping. Breaking things.
          
          Awkward silence.
          
                                                                 111.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    So who's the guy?
          
                              SUMMER
                    Who, my guy?
          
                              TOM
                    Yeah... Wait. Don't tell me. I
                    don't want to know.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    No really, I don't.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Ok.
          
          More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And
          THEN:
          
                              TOM
                    It's amazing to me. You're married.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I know.
          
                              TOM
                    You're not only someone's
                    girlfriend, your someone's wife!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Pretty crazy, huh?
          
                              TOM
                        (SIGHS)
                    I'll never understand that.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom --
          
                              TOM
                    What's different now? How could
                    things change so quickly?
          
                              SUMMER
                    I don't know. It just happened.
          
                              TOM
                    What happened?! That's what I don't
                    get.
          
                                                                 112.
          
          
          
                              SUMMER
                    I... Tom...
          
                              TOM
                    What, tell me...
          
                              SUMMER
                    I woke up one day and I knew.
          
          Tom says nothing.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I knew I could promise him I'd feel
                    the same way every morning. In a
                    way that I... I never could with
                    you.
          
          And there's not much else to say after that.
          
          Tom gets up to leave.
          
                              TOM
                    You know what sucks? Realizing that
                    everything you believe in is
                    complete bullshit.
          
                               SUMMER
                    What is?
          
                              TOM
                    Destiny, soulmates, true love. All
                    that stuff. It's nothing more than
                    silly childhood fairy tale
                    nonsense, isn't it? God!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom, don't go.
          
                              TOM
                    I should have listened to you,
                    Summer. You were right all along.
          
          Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.
          
                              SUMMER
                    I was right?
          
          And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.
          
                              TOM
                    What? This is funny?
          
                                                                  113.
          
          
          
          Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's
          completely cracking up.
          
                              TOM
                    What are you laughing at?
          
          And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.
          
                              TOM
                        (trying himself not to
                         LAUGH)
                    You're a crazy person!
          
                              SUMMER
                    Tom! You're the crazy person!
          
                              TOM
                    What are you talking about?!
          
                              SUMMER
                    One day I'm reading a book at the
                    corner deli and this guy sits down
                    and starts asking about it. Now
                    he's my husband!
          
                              TOM
                    This is funny to you?
          
                               SUMMER
                    What would have happened if I went
                    to the movies instead? If I went
                    somewhere else for lunch? If I
                    showed up to eat ten minutes later?
                    Tom, it was meant to be, just like
                    you said. And as it was happening,
                    I knew it. I could feel it, sure as
                    the sun. And I kept thinking to
                    myself "Holy shit. Tom was right."
                    You were right about all of it.
                        (BEAT)
                    It just wasn't me you were right
                    about.
          
          Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her
          wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact
          shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a
          few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.
          
                              SUMMER
                    Anyway, I should probably be
                    getting back. It was good to see
                    you. I'm glad you're well.
          
                                                                 114.
          
          
          
          Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a
          SECOND:
          
                                 TOM
                       Summer!
          
          She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely
          for the last time ever.
          
                                 TOM
                       I really do hope you're happy.
          
                                  SUMMER
                       I know.
                           (BEAT)
                       See you later.
          
          And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving
          Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every
          second.
          
                                                          FADE OUT:
          
          
          A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...
          
                                                           FADE IN:
          
          
          (500)
          INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY
          
          Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches
          at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers
          Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big
          time.
          
          Tom waits.
          
          We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a
          another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.
          
                                 GIRL
                       Are you here to interview?
          
                                 TOM
                       Sorry?
          
                                                                 115.
          
          
          
                              GIRL
                    Are you interviewing? For the
                    position?
          
                              TOM
                    Oh. Yeah. Why, are you?
          
                                 GIRL
                    Yup.
          
                              TOM
                    Ah. My competition.
          
                              GIRL
                    It would appear.
          
                              TOM
                    Gee, this is a little awkward.
          
                                 GIRL
                    Yes it is.
          
                              TOM
                    Well, I hope you don't get it.
          
                              GIRL
                    I hope you don't get it.
          They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's
          during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we
          can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this
          girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.
          And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.
          
                                 TOM
                    So, uh...
          
                                 GIRL
                    Hmm?
          
                              TOM
                    Are you from...California?
          
                              GIRL
                    Grew up not too far from here.
                    Atherton, near Stanford.
          
                              TOM
                    I know Atherton. Nice area.
          
                              GIRL
                    Have I seen you before?
          
                                                                 116.
          
          
          
                              TOM
                    I, uh, don't know. I don't think
                    so.
          
                              GIRL
                    Do you go to St. Patrick's? Not to
                    pray or anything but to stand
                    outside?
          
                              TOM
                    I do! I love that church. It's like
                    my favorite structure in the city.
          
                              GIRL
                    If only it wasn't near that
                    horrible mirrored thing...
          
                              TOM
                    Yes! Exactly. I totally agree!
          
                               GIRL
                    Yeah.
                        (BEAT)
                    I think I've seen you there.
          
                              TOM
                    You have? Really? Hmm. I didn't see
                    you.
          
                              GIRL
                    It happens. You probably weren't
                    looking.
          
          A MAN comes out.
          
                              MAN
                    Tom Hansen?
          
                                 TOM
                    Yes.
          
                              MAN
                    Come on back.
          
                                 TOM
                    Thank you.
          
          He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses
          and looks back at the girl.
          
                                                                 117.
          
          
          
                              NARRATOR
                    If Tom had learned anything... it
                    was that you can't ascribe great
                    cosmic significance to a simple
                    earthly event. Coincidence. That's
                    all anything ever is. Nothing more
                    than coincidence.
          
          ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.
          Hardly noticeable. But it's there.
          
                               NARRATOR
                    It took a long time but Tom had
                    finally learned. There are no
                    miracles. There's no such thing as
                    fate. Nothing is meant to be. He
                    knew. He was sure of it now.
                        (BEAT)
                    Tom was...
          
          Tom turns back around.
          
                              NARRATOR
                    ...pretty sure.
          
                               TOM
                        (to Girl)
                    Excuse me.
          
                              GIRL
                    Hello stranger.
          
                              TOM
                    When this is over... uh... would
                    you like to maybe...grab a cup of
                    coffee or something?
          
                              GIRL
                    Oh. I'm sorta supposed to meet
                    someone.
          
                              TOM
                        (DEFLATED)
                    Oh. Got it... No problem.
          
          He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on
          the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.
          
                              GIRL
                    Ok.
          
          Tom turns back around.
          
                                                                118.
          
          
          
                               TOM
                     What's that?
          
                                GIRL
                     Why not?
          
                                TOM
                     Yeah?
          
                                GIRL
                     Yeah.
          
                               TOM
                     Great! So... I'll wait for you
                     here, or you wait for me
                     or...something.
          
          She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.
          
                               GIRL
                     We'll figure it out.
          
                                TOM
                     Ok!
                         (extends hand to shake)
                     My name's Tom.
          
                               GIRL
                     Nice to meet you...
          
          She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.
          
                               GIRL
                     I'm Autumn.
          
          And on his face...
          
                                                      SMASH CUT TO:

                                                            June 4th, 2007


          

          
          White letters on a black screen:
          Receive with simplicity everything that happens to you.

          -RASHI

          

          FADE IN:

          AGAINST BLACK: SNOWFLAKES

          
          The flakes drift lazily down toward us. Our angle looks straight
          up.
          Now an angle looking steeply down: the snow falls not quite dead
          away to collect on a
          foreground chimneypot and on the little shtetl street that lies
          maplike below us.
          It is night, and quiet, and the street is deserted except for
          one man who walks away from
          us, his valenki squeaking in the fresh snow. He carries bundled
          branches on one shoulder
          and has a hatchet tucked into his belt.

          
          We cut down to street level. The man walks toward us, bearded,
          and bundled against the
          cold. Smiling, he mutters in Yiddish-the dialogue subtitled.

          

          MAN
          What a marvel... what a marvel...

          

          HOUSE INTERIOR
          As its door opens and the man enters.

          

          MAN
          Dora!

          

          VOICE
          Yes...

          
          The man crosses to the stove with his bundle of wood. The voice
          continues:

          

          

          

          

          2
          . Can you help me with the ice?
          The man dumps the wood into a box by the stove as his wife enters
          with an ice pick.
          . I expected you hours ago.

          MAN
          You can't imagine what just happened. I was coming back
          on the Lublin road when the wheel came off the cart
          thank heavens it was the way back and I'd already sold the
          geese!

          

          WIFE
          How much?

          

          MAN
          Fifteen groshen, but that's not the story. I was struggling to
          set the cart upright when a droshky approaches from the
          direction of Lvov. How lucky, you think, that someone is
          out this late.

          

          WIFE
          Yes, very remarkable.

          

          MAN
          But that's the least of it! He stops to help me; we talk of
          this, we talk of that-it turns out this is someone you know!
          Traitle Groshkover!

          
          His wife stares at him as he beams.
          He takes the stare as a sign that she can't place the name.
          . You know, REB GROSHKOVER! Pesel Bunim's uncle!
          The chacham from Lodz, who studied under the Zohar reb
          in Krakow!

          
          Still she stares. Then, quietly:

          

          WIFE
          God has cursed us.

          

          MAN
          What?

          

          WIFE
          Traitle Groshkover has been dead for three years.

          
          Laughter erupts from the man but, as his wife continues to stare
          at him, he strangles on it.
          Quiet.
          Wind whistles under the eaves.

          
          The man says quietly:

          

          MAN
          Why do you say such a thing! I saw the man! I talked to him!

          

          WIFE
          You talked to a dybbuk. Traitle Groshkover died of typhus
          in Pesel Bunim's house. Pesel told me-she sat shiva for
          him.

          
          They stare at each through a silence broken only by the sound
          of the quickening wind.
          A rap at the door.
          Neither immediately responds.
          Finally, to her husband:

          
          Who is it?

          

          MAN
          For some soup, to warm himself.
          The wind moans. He helped me, Dora!

          

          THE DOOR
          We are looking in from the outside as it unlatches and creaks
          in, opened by the husband
          in the foreground, who has arranged his face into a strained
          look of greeting. In the
          background the wife stares, hollow-eyed.

          

          MAN
          REB GROSHKOVER! You are welcome here!
          Reverse on REB GROSHKOVER: a short, merry-looking fellow with
          a bifurcated beard and a
          silk hat and spectacles. He gives a little squeal of delight.

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          You are too kind, Velvel! Too kind!

          
          He steps into the house and sees the wife staring at him.
          And you must be Dora! So much I have heard of you!
          Yes, your cheeks are pink and your legs are stout! What a
          wife you have!

          
          The husband chuckles nervously.

          

          MAN
          Yes! A ray of sun, a ray of sun! Sit!

          

          WIFE
          My husband said he offered you soup.

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          Yes, but I couldn't possibly eat this late, or I'd have
          nightmares. No, no: no soup for me!

          

          WIFE
          I knew it.

          
          REB GROSHKOVER laughs.

          REB GROSHKOVER
          I see! You think I'm fat enough already!

          
          He settles, chuckling, into his chair, but Dora remains sober:

          

          WIFE
          No. A dybbuk doesn't eat.

          

          

          

          

          5
          REB GROSHKOVER stares at her, shocked.
          The wife returns the stare.
          The husband looks from wife to REB GROSHKOVER, apprehensive.
          A heavy silence.
          REB GROSHKOVER bursts into pealing laughter.

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          What a wife you have!

          
          He wipes away tears of merriment; the husband relaxes, even begins
          to smile.

          

          MAN
          I assure you, REB GROSHKOVER, it's nothing personal; she
          heard a story you had died, three years ago, at Pesel
          Bunim's house. This is why she think you are a dybbuk; I,
          of course, do not believe in such things. I am a rational
          man.

          
          REB GROSHKOVER is still chuckling.

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          Oh my. Oh my yes. What nonsense. And even if there
          were spirits, certainly...
          He thumps his chest.
          I am not one of them!

          

          WIFE
          Pesel always worried. Your corpse was left unattended for
          many minutes when Pesel's father broke shiva and left the
          room-it must have been then that the Evil One-
          She breaks off to spit at the mention of the Evil One.
          -took you!

          
          REB GROSHKOVER is terribly amused:

          

          

          

          

          6

          REB GROSHKOVER
          "My corpse!" Honestly! What a wife you have!

          

          WIFE
          Oh yes? Look, husband...

          
          She steps forward to the Reb, who looks enquiringly up at her.
          They were preparing the body. Pesel's father shaved
          one check...

          
          As his eyes roll down to look at her hand, she draws it across
          his smooth right cheek.
          Then he left the room. He came back, and shaved the
          other...

          
          She reaches across to the other cheek, REB GROSHKOVER's eyes
          following her hand-
          You were already gone!

          
          -and drags her hand across. A bristly sound.

          
          REB GROSHKOVER laughs.

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          I shaved hastily this morning and missed a bit-by you this
          makes me a dybbuk?

          
          He appeals to the husband:
          It's true, I was sick with typhus when I stayed with
          Peselle, but I recovered, as you can plainly see, and now
          I-hugh!

          
          The wife steps back.
          REB GROSHKOVER looks slowly down at his own chest in which the
          wife has just planted an
          ice pick.
          REB GROSHKOVER stares at the ice pick.
          The wife stares.

          

          

          

          

          7
          The husband stares.
          Suddenly, REB GROSHKOVER bursts out laughing:
          What a wife you have!
          The husband can manage only a shocked whisper:

          

          MAN
          Woman, what have you done?

          
          REB GROSHKOVER again looks down at his chest, which again moves
          him to laughter. He
          shakes his head.

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          Why would she do such a thing?

          
          He looks up.
          I ask you, Velvel, as a rational man: which of us is
          possessed?

          

          WIFE
          What do you say now about spirits? He is unharmed!

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          On the contrary! I don't feel at all well.

          
          And indeed, blood has begun to soak through his vest.
          He chuckles with less energy.
          One does a mitzvah and this is the thanks one gets?

          

          

          MAN
          Dora! Woe, woe! How can such a thing be!

          

          REB GROSHKOVER
          Perhaps I will have some soup. I am feeling weak...

          
          He rises to his feet but totters.
          Or perhaps I should go...

          

          

          

          

          8
          He smiles weakly at Dora..
          One knows when one isn't wanted.
          He walks unsteadily to the door, opens it with some effort, and
          staggers out into the
          moaning wind and snow to be swallowed by the night.
          The wife and husband stare at the door banging in the wind.

          FINALLY:

          

          MAN
          Dear wife. We are ruined. Tomorrow they will discover
          the body. All is lost.

          

          WIFE
          Nonsense, Velvel...
          She walks to the door...
          Blessed is the Lord. Good riddance to evil and shuts it against
          the wind.

          BLACK
          A drumbeat thumps in the black.
          Music blares: the Jefferson Airplane. Grace Slick's voice enters:
          When the truth is found to be lies
          And all the hope inside you dies
          Don't you want somebody to love. . .

          
          An image fades in slowly, but even up full it is dim: some kind
          of round, dull white shape
          with a small black pinhole center. This white half-globe is a
          plug set in a flesh-toned
          field. The flesh tone glows translucently, backlit. We are drifting
          toward the white plug
          and, as we do so, the music grows louder still.

          

          AN EARPIECE

          

          

          

          

          9
          A pull back-a reverse on the preceding push in-from the cheap
          white plastic earpiece
          of a transistor radio. The Jefferson Airplane continues over
          the cut but becomes
          extremely compressed. The pull back reveals that the earpiece
          is lodged in someone's
          ear and trails a white cord.

          
          We drift down the cord to find the radio at its other end. As
          we do so we hear, live in the
          room, many voices speaking a foreign language in unison. A classroom,
          apparently.
          The radio is on a desktop but hidden from in front by the book
          held open before it. The
          book is written in non-Roman characters.
          We are in Hebrew school.

          
          The boy who is listening to the transistor radio-DANNY Gopnik-sits
          at a hinge-topped
          desk in a cinderblock classroom whose rows of desks are occupied
          by other boys and
          girls of about twelve years of age. It is dusk and the room is
          flourescent-lit.
          At the front of the room a gray-haired man in a worn suit and
          tie addresses the class.
          DANNY straightens one leg so that he may dig into a pocket. With
          an eye on the TEACHER to
          make sure he isn't being watched, he eases something out:
          A twenty-dollar bill.

          

          TEACHER
          Mee yodayah? Reuven? Rifkah? Mah zeh "anakim"?
          Efsheh mashooach ba-avodah?

          

          A BLINDING LIGHT
          At the cut to the light the Jefferson Airplane music jumps up
          full. The light resolves into
          a multi-flared image of a blinking eye.
          Reverse: the inside of a human ear. Fleshy whorls finely veined,
          a cavity receding to
          dark.
          Objective on the DOCTOR's office: the DOCTOR is peering through
          a lightscope into the ear of
          an early-middle-aged man, LARRY Gopnik.
          The Jefferson Airplane music continues.

          

          

          

          

          10

          DOCTOR
          Uh-huh.

          HEBREW SCHOOL
          Close on Hebrew characters being scribbled onto the blackboard
          as the TEACHER talks.
          The TEACHER, talking.
          A bored child, staring off.
          His point-of-view: a blacktopped parking lot with a few orange
          school busses, beyond it a
          marshy field, and distant suburban bungalows.
          Close on another child staring at something through drooping
          eyelids.
          His point-of-view: very close on the face of a classroom clock.
          We hear its electrical
          hum. Its red sweep-second hand crawls around the dial very, very
          slowly.
          DANNY Gopnik hisses:

          DANNY
          Fagle!.. .
          The TEACHER drones on, writing on the blackboard. DANNY's eyes
          flit from the TEACHER to
          the student sitting kitty-corner in front of him-a husky youth
          with shaggy hair. He
          hasn't heard the prompt.
          . Fagle!
          The TEACHER turns from the blackboard and DANNY leans back, eyes
          front, folding the
          twenty up small behind his book.

          TEACHER
          Ahnee rotzeh lalechet habait hakisai. Mee yodayah?
          Misaviv tamid anachnoo tamid...
          The clock-watching child, eyelids sinking, is beginning to drool
          out of one side of his
          mouth.

          DOCTOR'S OFFICE

          

          

          

          

          11
          The light again flaring the lens.
          Reverse: looking into a pupil.
          Objective: the DOCTOR looking through his scope into LARRY's
          eye.

          DOCTOR
          Mm-hmm.

          HEBREW SCHOOL
          A bored child is excavating a bugger from his nose.
          The TEACHER turns back to the chalkboard to circle something.

          DANNY
          Fagle!

          TEACHER
          Hamrah oomoh-
          He interrupts himself briefly to make a couple of phlegm-hawking
          sounds. He resumes:
          . Hamrah oomoh meshiach oomshel zal?

          DOCTOR'S OFFICE
          The DOCTOR palpates LARRY's midriff, digging his fingers into
          the hairy, baggy flesh.
          DOCTOR's Voice
          Uh-huh. We'll do some routine X-rays.

          HEBREW SCHOOL
          A young girl holds a hank of her bangs in front of her face,
          separating out individual hairs
          to examine them for split ends.

          TEACHER
          Ahnoo ahnoo mah? Mah? Talmidim? D'vorah?

          

          

          

          

          12

          D'VORAH
          Ahnee to yodayah.
          The TEACHER begins to pace the desk aisles, looking back and
          forth among the students.

          TEACHER
          Mee yodayah?
          The bugger-seeker, having succesfully withdrawn a bugger, carefully
          drapes it over the
          sharp end of his pencil, to what end we cannot know.
          DANNY, apprehensively eyeing the TEACHER, slides the twenty into
          the transistor radio's
          cover-sleeve.

          X-RAY CONE
          A huge white rubberized cone, pointed directly at us.
          We hear a rush of static and the DOCTOR's voice filtered through
          a talk-back:
          DOCTOR's Voice
          Hold still.
          Wider: LARRY is in his shorts lying on his back on an examining
          table covered by a sheet
          of tissue paper. The X-ray cone is pointed at the middle of his
          body.
          There is a brief sci-fi-like machine hum. It clicks off.

          HEBREW SCHOOL
          The clock-watching student's head is making descending bobs toward
          his chest.

          TEACHER
          Nefsheh shelach hamilamid-eh?!
          The TEACHER's circuit of the classroom has taken him around behind
          DANNY. DANNY's
          book lies face-down on the desk, covering the radio, but the
          white cord snakes out from
          under it up to his ear.
          The TEACHER yanks at the cord.

          

          

          

          

          13
          The cord pops out of its jack and the Jefferson Airplane blares
          tinnily from beneath the
          book of torah stories.
          The TEACHER lifts the book to expose the jangling radio.
          Outraged, the TEACHER projects above the music:
          . Mah zeh? ! Mah zeh? !
          Some of the students are singing along; a couple beat rhythm
          on their desks.
          . Shechet, talmidim! Anachnoo lo cam zeh b'bait sefer!
          Shechet bivakasha!
          Three other students join in a chorus:

          

          STUDENTS
          Shechet! Shechet bivakasha!
          The nodding student's head droops ever lower.
          Other students join in the chant:

          SHECHET! SHECHET! SHECHET BIVAKASHA!

          
          The nodding student's chin finally reaches, and settles on, his
          chest, and he gives a long
          snorfling inhale of sleep.

          

          DOCTOR'S OFFICE
          LARRY, now fully clothed, is seated across from the DOCTOR.
          The DOCTOR is looking at his file. He absently taps a cigarette
          out of a pack and lights up.
          He nods as he smokes, looking at the file.

          

          DOCTOR
          Well, I-sorry.
          He holds the pack toward LARRY.

          

          

          

          

          14

          LARRY
          No thanks.

          DOCTOR
          Well, you're in good health. How're Judith and the kids?

          LARRY
          Good. Everyone's good. You know.
          The DOCTOR takes a long suck.

          DOCTOR
          Good. Daniel must be-what? About to be bar mitzvah?

          LARRY
          Two weeks.

          DOCTOR
          Well, mazel tov. They grow up fast, don't they?

          TINTED PHOTO PORTRAIT
          The portrait, old, in an ornate gilt frame, is of a middle-aged
          rabbi with a small neat
          mustache and round spectacles. He wears a tallis hood-style and
          a phylactery box is
          strapped to his forehead. A plaque set into the frame identifies
          the man as Rabbi Minda.
          Wider shows that the portrait hangs in the Hebrew school principal's
          office, a white
          cinderblock room. It is quiet. The only sound is a deep electrical
          hum.
          Just visible behind the principal's desk, upon which is a low
          stack of books and a name
          plate identifying the occupant as MAR TURCHIK, is the top of
          a man's head-an old
          man, with a few whispy white hairs where his yarmulka is not.
          DANNY, seated opposite, pushes up from his slouch to better see
          across the desk.
          We boom up to show more of the principal. He is short. He wears
          a white shirt and
          hoist-up pants that come to just below his armpits. He has thick
          eyeglasses. He fiddles
          with the transistor radio, muttering:

          PRINCIPAL
          Hmm... eh... nu?

          

          

          

          

          15
          He experiments with different dials on the radio.
          DANNY nervously watches.

          DANNY
          You put the-
          The old man holds up one hand.

          PRINCIPAL
          In ivrit. (In Hebrew)

          DANNY
          Um...
          The old man looks down at the little earpiece pinched between
          two fingers. He examines
          it as a superstitious native might a Coca-Cola bottle.
          The source of the electrical hum: a wall clock whose red sweep-second
          hand crawls
          around the dial very, very slowly.
          The Reb continues to squint at the earpiece.
          DANNY sighs. He encourages:

          DANNY
          Yeah, you-
          The principal's tone is harder:

          PRINCIPAL
          In ivrit!
          This time his cold look holds until he is sure that the admonishment
          has registered.
          He looks back down at the earpiece.
          We hear the door open. The principal ignores it.
          An old woman walks slowly in with a teacup chattering on a saucer.
          She has thick
          eyeglasses. She wears thick flesh-colored support hose. She takes
          slow, short steps
          toward the desk. The principal is studying the radio.

          

          

          

          

          16

          PRINCIPAL
          Mneh...
          The old woman continues to take slow short steps toward him.
          The tableau looks like a
          performance-art piece.
          She reaches the desk and sets the teacup down. She summons a
          couple of phlegm-
          hawking rasps and turns to go.
          She takes slow short steps toward the door.
          The principal raises the earpiece experimentally toward his ear.
           Close on his hairy, wrinkled ear as his trembling fingers bring
          in the earpiece. The
          i f ngers push and wobble and tamp the earpiece into place, hesitate,
          and then do some
          more pushing and wobbling and tamping.
          The principal keeps DANNY fixed with a stare as his hand hesitantly
          drops from his ear,
          ready to reach back up should the earpiece loosen.
          .mneh...
          Satisfied that neither the student nor the earpiece are about
          to make any sudden moves, he
          looks down at the radio. He turns a dial.
          Faintly and tinnily from the earpiece we hear the compressed
          jangle of rock music. The
          rabbi stares blankly, listening.
          DANNY slumps, looking warily at the rabbi.
          The rabbi continues to stare down at the radio. The compressed
          rock music jangles on.
          The rabbi is expressionless, mouth slightly open, listening.
          Tableau: anxious student, earplugged spiritual leader.
          Muffled, from the outer office, the hawking of phlegm.

          CLASSROOM
          We are behind a man who writes equations on a chalkboard, shoulder
          at work and hand
          quickly waggling. Periodically he glances back, giving us a fleeting
          look at his face: it is

          

          

          

          

          17
          LARRY Gopnik.

          LARRY
          You following this?... Okay?.. So... Heh-heh... This
          part is exciting...
          Students follow along, bored.
          LARRY continues to write.
          . So, okay. So. So if that's that, then we can do this,
          right? Is that right? Isn't that right? And that's
          Schrodinger's paradox, right? Is the cat dead or is the cat
          not dead? Okay?

          BLEGEN HALL
          LARRY is entering the physics department office. The department's
          secretary wheels her
          castored chair away from her typing.

          SECRETARY
          Messages, Professor Gopnik.
          He takes the three phone messages.

          LARRY
          Thank you, Natalie. Oh-CLIVE. Come in.
          A Korean graduate student who was been waiting on a straightbacked
          chair rises.

          LARRY'S OFFICE
          He is flipping through the messages. Absently:

          LARRY
          So, uh, what can I do for you?
          The messages:
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton
          OF Columbia Record Club

          

          

          

          

          18

          CALLED.
          REGARDING: "Please call."
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman

          CALLED.
          REGARDING "Let's talk."
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT CLIVE Park

          CALLED.
          REGARDING: "Unjust test results."
          He crumples the last one.

          CLIVE
          Uh, Dr. Gopnik, I believe the results of Physics Mid-Term
          were unjust.

          LARRY
          Uh-huh, how so?

          CLIVE
          I received an unsatisfactory grade. In fact: F, the failing
          grade.

          LARRY
          Uh, yes. You failed the mid-term. That's accurate.

          CLIVE
          Yes, but this is not just. I was unaware to be examined on
          the mathematics.

          LARRY
          Well-you can't do physics without mathematics, really,
          can you.

          CLIVE
          If I receive failing grade I lose my scholarship, and feel
          shame. I understand the physics. I understand the dead cat.

          LARRY

          (SURPRISED)
          You understand the dead cat?

          

          

          

          

          19
          CLIVE nods gravely.
          But... you... you can't really understand the physics
          without understanding the math. The math tells how it
          really works. That's the real thing; the stories I give you in
          class are just illustrative; they're like, fables, say, to help
          give you a picture. An imperfect model. I mean-even I
          don't understand the dead cat. The math is how it really
          works.
          CLIVE shakes his head, dubious.

          CLIVE
          Very difficult... very difficult...

          LARRY
          Well, I... I'm sorry, but I... what do you propose?

          CLIVE
          Passing grade.

          LARRY
          No no, I-

          CLIVE
          Or perhaps I can take the mid-term again. Now I know it
          covers mathematics.

          LARRY
          Well, the other students wouldn't like that, would they. If
          one student gets to retake the test til he gets a grade he
          likes.
          CLIVE impassively considers this.

          CLIVE
          Secret test.
          LARRY wraps a hand wearily over his eyes.

          LARRY
          . No, I'm afraid-

          

          

          

          

          20

          CLIVE
          Hush-hush.

          LARRY
          No, that's just not workable. I'm afraid we'll just have to
          bite the bullet on this thing, CLIVE, and-

          CLIVE
          Very troubling.
          He rises.
          . very troubling...
          He goes to the door, shaking his head, as LARRY looks on in surprise.
          He leaves.
          LARRY stares at the open door. The secretary outside, her back
          to us, types on.
          LARRY. looks stupidly around his own office, shakes his head.
          He picks up the phone message from Sy Ableman-"Let's talk"-and
          dials. As he dials
          his other hand wanders over the papers on the desktop.
          There is a plain white envelope on the desk. LARRY picks it up
          as the phone rings through.
          A ring is clipped short and a warm basso-baritone rumbles through
          the line:
          Phone Voice
          Sy Ableman.

          LARRY
          Hello, Sy, LARRY Gopnik.

          SY

          (MOURNFUL)
          LARRY. How are you, my friend.
          LARRY picks idly at the envelope.

          LARRY
          Good, how've you been, Sy?

          

          

          

          

          21
          Inside the envelope: a thick sheaf of one-hundred-dollar bills.

          SY
          Oh fine. Shall we talk LARRY.
          LARRY reacts to the money.

          LARRY
          (into phone)
          What?! Oh! Sorry! I, uh-call back!
          He slams down the phone.

          . CLIVE!
          He rushes out the door, through the secretarial area, and into
          the hallway, and looks up
          toward the elevators.
          Empty.
          He looks at the stuffed envelope he still holds.
          He goes back to the departmental office. The secretary sits typing.
          She glances at him
          and, as she goes back to her typing:

          SECRETARY
          Sy Ableman just called. Said he got disconnected.

          BATHROOM DOOR
          A hand enters to knock.
          Man's Voice
          Out in a minute!
          SARAH, the sixteen-year-old girl who has just knocked, rolls
          her eyes.

          SARAH
          I gotta wash my hair! I'm going out tonight!

          VOICE
          Out in a minute!

          

          

          

          

          22

          SARAH
          Jesus Christ!
          She stomps down the hall.

          KITCHEN
          Judith, a woman of early middle age, is at the stove. SARAH enters.

          SARAH
          W is Uncle Arthur always in the bathroom?

          JUDITH
          He has to drain his sebacious cyst. You know that. Will
          you set the table?

          SARAH
          Why can't he do it in the basement? Or go out in the
          garage!

          BUS
          We are raking the exterior of an orange school bus as it rattles
          along. Hebrew characters
          on the side identify it-to some, anyway.

          INSIDE
          We are locked down on DANNY as the bus rattles like an old crate,
          squeaking, grinding
          gears, belching exhaust. DANNY and the children around him vibrate
          and pitch about but,
          from their lack of reaction, seem used to it.
          They raise their voices to be heard over the engine noise and
          the various stress noises in
          the chassis and a transistor radio somewhere that plays Jefferson
          Airplane.

          DANNY
          I had twenty bucks in it too. Inside the case.

          

          

          

          

          23
          Mark Sallerson
          Twenty bucks! How come.

          DANNY
          I bought a lid from Mike Fagle. Couple weeks ago. I still
          owed him twenty.
          Mark Sallerson
          He already gave you the pot?

          DANNY
          Yeah but a couple weeks ago my funding got cut off. Fagle
          said he'd pound the crap out of me if I didn't pay up.
          Howard Altar
          What funding got cut off? Where do you get your money?
          Another boy, with thick glasses, is Ronnie Nudell.
          Ronnie Nudell
          What happened?
          Mark Sallerson
          Rabbi Turchik took his radio. Had money in it.
          Ronnie Nudell
          That fucker!

          DANNY
          Yeah. I think he said he was confiscating it.
          Ronnie Nudell
          He's a fucker! Where do you get your money?
          Mark Sallerson
          Mike Fagle's gonna kick his ass. Last week he pounded
          the crap out of Seth Seddlemeyer.

          

          

          

          

          24
          Ronnie Nudell
          He's a fucker!
          Mark Sallerson
          Fagle? Or Seth Seddlemeyer?
          Ronnie Nudell
          They're both f ickers!

          BATHROOM DOOR
          A hand enters to knock.
          Uncle Arthur's Voice
          Out in a minute!

          SARAH
          Are you still in there?!
          Uncle Arthur
          I, uh.. . Just a minute!

          SARAH
          I've gotta wash my hair! I'm going out tonight, to the hole!
          Uncle Arthur
          Okay!

          OUTSIDE
          LARRY pulls into the driveway and gets out of the car. The purr
          of a lawn mower. He
          looks.
          His point-of-view: Gar Brandt, the next-door neighbor, is mowing
          his lawn. He has a
          buzz cut and is wearing a white T-shirt.
          Another noise competes with the lawn mower: rattling, squeaking,
          gear-grinding. The
          orange school bus with Hebrew lettering pulls up across the street.
          Its door opens with a
          pneumatic hiss to discharge a passenger.

          

          

          

          

          25

          DINNER TABLE
          LARRY sits in. His wife and two children are already seated.
          There is one empty place.
          LARRY projects:

          LARRY
          Arthur!
          A muffled voice:

          ARTHUR
          Yeah!

          LARRY
          Dinner!

          ARTHUR
          Okay! Out in a minute!

          LARRY
          We should wait.

          SARAH
          Are you kidding!
          They start eating.

          LARRY
          Mr. Brandt keeps mowing part of our lawn.

          JUDY
          Does that matter?

          LARRY
          What?

          JUDY
          Is it important?
          LARRY shrugs.

          LARRY
          It's just odd.

          

          

          

          

          26

          JUDY
          Any news on your tenure?

          LARRY
          I think they'll give me tenure.

          JUDY
          You think.

          LARRY

          (EQUABLY)
          Well, I don't know. These things aren't, you know.. .

          JUDY
          No, I don't know. Which is why I ask.

          LARRY

          WELL-

          SARAH
          Mom, how long is Uncle Arthur staying with us?

          JUDY
          Ask your father.

          BACK YARD
          Twilight.
          LARRY is stepping onto a hose as he unwheels it from the drum
          of a traveling sprinkler,
          laying out an are to cover the back yard. Intermittent thwacks
          from next door:
          Gar Brandt and his son, who also has a buzz cut and a white T-shirt,
          throw a baseball
          back and forth. Gar Brandt throws hard. The ball pops in the
          boy's mitt.

          MITCH
          Ow.
          LARRY walks over to the boundary defined by the fresh mowing.
          He sights down it.
          Gar Brandt looks over his shoulder at LARRY, looking. Gar Brandt
          is expressionless. He

          

          

          

          

          27
          goes back to throwing.

          MITCH
          Ow.

          INSIDE
          Evening. Lights on. LARRY sits at the kitchen table, a briefcase
          open on the chair next to
          him. Blue books-examination booklets-are spread on the table
          in front of him. He
          reads, occasionally making marginal scribbles, grading.
          From off, faint and dulled by intervening walls, rock music:
          somewhere in the house
          DANNY is listening to the Jefferson Airplane.
          The clink of teaspoon against china as LARRY stirs his tea. He
          looks up at a noise: JUDY
          enters.

          JUDY
          Honey.

          LARRY

          (ABSENT)
          Honey.

          JUDY
          Did you talk to Sy?
          Still absent, without looking up:

          LARRY
          Sy?-Sy Ableman!-That's right, he called, but I-

          JUDY
          You didn't talk to him.

          LARRY
          No, I-

          JUDY
          You know the problems you and I have been having.
          Sympathetic, but still absent:

          

          

          

          

          28

          LARRY
          Mm.

          JUDY
          Well, Sy and I have become very close.
          This brings LARRY's head up. He focuses on JUDY, puzzled. She
          elaborates:
          In.short: I think it's time to start talking about a divorce.
          LARRY stares at her. A long beat.
          At length, trying to digest:

          LARRY
          . Sy Ableman!

          JUDY
          This is not about Sy.

          LARRY
          You mentioned Sy!

          JUDY
          Don't twist my words. We-

          LARRY
          A divorce-what have I done! I haven't done anything-
          What have I done!

          JUDY
          LARRY, don't be a child. You haven't "done" anything. I
          haven't "done" anything.

          LARRY
          Yes! Yes! We haven't done anything! And I-I'm
          probably about to get tenure!

          JUDY
          Nevertheless, there have been problems. As you know.

          LARRY

          

          

          

          

          29

          WELL-

          JUDY
          And things have changed. And then-Sy Ableman. Sy has
          come into my life. And now-

          LARRY
          Come into your-what does that mean?! You, you, you,
          you barely know him!

          JUDY
          We've known the Ablemans for fifteen years.

          LARRY
          Yes, but you you said we hadn't done anything!
          JUDY suddenly is stony:

          JUDY
          I haven't done anything. This is not some flashy fling.
          This is not about woopsy-doopsy.
          LARRY stares at her.

          LARRY
          Sy Ableman!
          From down the hall, a knock on a door. A muffled voice:

          ARTHUR
          Out in a minute!

          JUDY
          Look, I didn't know any other way of breaking it to you.
          Except to tell you. And treat you like an adult. Is that so
          wrong?
          LARRY does not seem to be listening. His eyes roam the room as
          he thinks.

          LARRY
          Where do I sleep?
          JUDY narrows her eyes.

          

          

          

          

          30

          JUDY
          What?

          LARRY
          Arthur's on the couch!

          JUDY
          Look. Sy feels that we should-

          LARRY
          Esther is barely cold!

          JUDY
          Esther died three years ago. And it was a loveless
          marriage. Sy wants a Gett.
          This derails the conversation. LARRY stares, trying to pick up
          the thread.

          LARRY
          . A what?

          JUDY
          A ritual divorce. He says it's very important. Without a
          Gett I'm an Aguna.

          LARRY
          A what? What are you talking about?
          She turns to go, shaking her head, peeved:

          JUDY
          You always act so surprised.
          As she leaves:
          I have begged you to see the Rabbi.

          FADE IN
          LARRY has fallen asleep at the kitchen table, face-down in a
          pile of blue books. Cold blue
          light sweeps across him and he looks up.

          

          

          

          

          31
          A short, balding middle-aged man in flannel pyjamas and an old
          flannel dressing gown
          stands in front of the open refrigerator holding an open jar
          of orange juice. He tips the jar
          back to drink, his free hand holding a balled-up towel to the
          back of his neck
          LARRY stares at him.

          FADE OUT

          BLEGEN HALL
          LARRY enters the departmental office. His eyes are red-rimmed
          and dark-bagged. He has
          beard stubble.
          The department's secretary wheels her castored chair away from
          her typing.

          SECRETARY
          Messages, Professor Gopnik.
          He takes the two phone messages.

          HIS OFFICE
          LARRY looks at the messages:
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT Dick Dutton
          OF Columbia Record Club

          CALLED.
          REGARDING: "2Â°d attempt. Please call."
          WHILE YOU WERE OUT Sy Ableman

          CALLED.
          REGARDING "Let's have a good talk."
          A knock brings his look up.

          LARRY
          Yes-thanks for coming, CLIVE.
          CLIVE Park enters the office.

          

          

          

          

          32
          . Have a seat.
          LARRY uses a key to open the top left desk drawer. He takes out
          the envelope.
          We had, I think, a good talk, the other day, but you left
          something that-

          CLIVE
          I didn't leave it.

          LARRY
          Well--you don't even know what I was going to say.

          CLIVE
          I didn't leave anything. I'm not missing anything. I know
          where everything is.
          LARRY looks at him, trying to formulate a thought.

          LARRY
          Well... then, CLIVE, where did this come from?
          He waves the envelope.
          . This is here, isn't it?
          CLIVE looks at it gravely.

          CLIVE
          Yes, sir. That is there.

          LARRY
          This is not nothing, this is something.

          CLIVE
          Yes sir. That is something.
          A beat.
          . What is it.

          LARRY
          You know what it is! You know what it is! I believe. And

          

          

          

          

          33
          you know I can't keep it, CLIVE.

          CLIVE
          Of course, sir.

          LARRY
          I'll have to pass it on to Professor Finkle, along with my
          suspicions about where it came from. Actions have
          consequences.

          CLIVE
          Yes. Often.

          LARRY
          Always! Actions always have consequences!
          He pounds the desk for emphasis.
          In this office, actions have consequences!

          CLIVE
          Yes sir.

          LARRY
          Not just physics. Morally.

          CLIVE
          Yes.

          LARRY
          And we both know about your actions.

          CLIVE
          No sir. I know about my actions.

          LARRY
          I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant me to
          understand.

          CLIVE
          Meer sir my sir.
          LARRY cocks his head.

          

          

          

          

          34

          LARRY
          . Meer sir my sir?

          CLIVE
          (careful enunciation)
          Mere... surmise. Sir.
          He gravely shakes his head.
          . Very uncertain.

          CLOSE ON A TONE ARM
          A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record.
          Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew
          chant.
          Close on the sleeve:
          Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion

          VOLUME 12
          Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes.
          They peer out from the
          dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's
          eyes peering out of the
          woods.
          Wider, on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm
          on the portable
          turntable.
          He chants the passage.
          He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants
          the passage again.
          DANNY listens, eyes narrowed. He lifts the tone arm and chants
          the passage again.
          He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm
          to echo it his door bursts
          open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant.

          

          

          

          

          35

          SARAH
          You little brat fucker! You snuck twenty bucks out of my
          drawer!

          DANNY
          Studying torah! Asshole!

          SARAH
          You little brat! I'm telling Dad!

          DANNY
          Oh yeah? You gonna tell him you've been sneaking it out
          of his wallet?

          SARAH
          All right, you know what I'm gonna do? You little brat? If
          you don't give it back?
          We hear the thunk of the front door opening. DANNY stands, calling:

          DANNY
          Dad?

          FOYER
          LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he stows it in the foyer
          closet DANNY's voice
          continues, off:

          DANNY
          Dad, you gotta fix the aerial.
          Judith emerges from the kitchen.

          JUDITH
          Hello LARRY, have you thought about a lawyer?

          LARRY
          Honey, please!
          DANNY emerges from the hall.

          DANNY

          

          

          

          

          36
          We're not getting channel four at all.

          LARRY
          (to Judith)
          Can we discuss it later?

          DANNY
          I can't get F Troop.

          JUDITH
          LARRY, the children know. Do you think this is some secret?
          Do you think this is something we're going to keep quiet?
          SARAH enters.

          SARAH
          Dad, Uncle Arthur is in the bathroom again! And I=m
          going to the hole at eight!
          She hits DANNY on the back of the head.

          DANNY
          Stop it!

          LARRY
          SARAH! What's going on!

          DANNY
          She keeps doing that!

          LATER
          LARRY sits in a reclining chair in the living room, head back,
          listening to Sidor Belarsky on
          the hi-fi. On top of the music is a hissing-sucking sound. There
          is also the sound of a
          pencil busily scratching paper.
          We cut to its source: Uncle Arthur sits scribbling into a spiral
          notebook, his free hand
          holding the end of a length of surgical tubing against the back
          of his neck. The tube leads
          to a water-pik-like appliance on an end table next to him-the
          source of the sucking
          sound.
          After a long beat of listening to the music, LARRY speaks into
          space:

          

          

          

          

          37

          LARRY
          Arthur?
          Uncle Arthur does not look up from his scribbling.
          Uncle Arthur
          Yes.
          LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.

          LARRY
          What're you doing?
          Still without looking up:
          Uncle Arthur
          Working on the Mentaculus.
          Long beat. Music. Scribbling.

          LARRY
          Any luck, um, looking for an apartment?
          More scribbling.
          Uncle Arthur
          No.
          The doorbell chimes.

          FRONT DOOR
          LARRY enters, glances through the front door's head-height window,
          and-freezes, one
          hand arrested on the way to the doorknob.
          His point-of-view: framed by the window, yellowly lit by the
          stoop light, a human head.
          A middle-aged man, a few years older than LARRY. A fleshy face
          with droopy hangdog
          features, a five-o'clock shadow, and sad Harold Bloom eyes.
          LARRY opens the door.

          

          

          

          

          38

          LARRY
          Sy.
          Sy, entering, thrusts out a hand. His voice vibrates with a warm,
          sad empathy:

          SY
          Good to see you, LARRY.
          He is a heavy-set man wearing a short-sleeved shirt that his
          belly tents out in front of
          him. In his left hand he holds a bottle of wine.

          LARRY

          (TIGHTLY)
          I'll get Judith.

          SY
          No, actually LARRY, I'm here to see you, if I might.
          He shakes his head.
          . Such a thing. Such a thing.

          LARRY
          Shall we go in the...
          He is leading him into the kitchen but Sy, oblivious to surroundings,
          plows on with the
          conversation, arresting both men in the narrow space between
          kitchen sink and stove, and
          invading LARRY's space.

          SY
          You know, LARRY-how we handle ourselves, in this
          situation-it's so impawtant.

          LARRY
          Uh-huh.

          SY
          Absolutely. Judith told me that she broke the news to you.
          She said you were very adult.

          LARRY
          Did she.

          

          

          

          

          39

          SY
          Absolutely. The respect she has for you.

          LARRY
          Yes?

          SY
          Absolutely. But the children, LARRY. The children.
          He shakes his head.
          . The most impawtant.

          LARRY
          Well, I guess...

          SY
          Of coss. And Judith says they're handling it so well. A
          tribute to you. Do you drink wine? Because this is an
          incredible bottle. This is not Mogen David. This is a wine,
          LARRY. A bawdeaux.

          LARRY
          You know, Sy-

          SY
          Open it-let it breathe. Ten minutes. Letting it breathe, so
          impawtant.

          LARRY
          Thanks, Sy, but I'm not-

          SY
          I insist! No reason for discumfit. I'll be uncumftable if
          you don't take it. These are signs and tokens, LARRY.

          LARRY
          I'm just-I'm not ungrateful, I'm, I just don't know a lot
          about wine and, given our respective, you know-
          He is startled when Sy abruptly hugs him.

          SY

          

          

          

          

          40
          S' okay.
          He finishes the hug off with a couple of thumps on the back.
          S'okay. Wuhgonnabe fine.

          SKEWED ANGLE ON PARKING LOT
          We are dutch on a slit of a view through a cracked-open frosted
          window: the Hebrew
          school parking lot.
          The last couple of busses filled with students are rolling out
          of the lot. It is late
          afternoon.
          A reverse shows DANNY in a stall, standing on a closed toilet,
          angling his head to peer out
          the bathroom window opened at the top.
          The bathroom outside the stall: Ronnie Nudell leans against a
          sink waiting, sucking a
          long draw from a joint.
          DANNY emerges from the stall. Ronnie Nudell offers the joint.
          Ronnie Nudell
          Want some of this fucker?

          HALLWAY
          The bathroom door cracks open in the foreground. DANNY peeks
          out.
          His point-of-view: the empty hallway ending in a T with another
          hallway. A janitor
          crosses, pushing a broom down the far hallway. He disappears.
          His echoing footsteps
          recede.
          DANNY and Ronny emerge from the bathroom.

          RABBI MINDA
          The photo-portrait on the wall of Mar Turchik's office lit by
          late-day sun.
          We hear a scraping sound.

          

          

          

          

          41
          Wider: Ronnie Nudell looks over DANNY's shoulder as DANNY, hunched
          at Mar Turchik's
          desk, fishes the end of a bent hanger into the keyhole on the
          top left drawer. After a beat,
          the hanger turns.
          They open the drawer. In it: squirt guns, marbles set to rolling
          by the opening of the
          drawer, a comic book, a Playboy magazine, a slingshot, a small
          bundle of firecrackers.
          Hands rifle the gewgaws: no radio.
          Ronnie Nudell
          Fuck.

          SANCTUARY
          We are behind the two boys who sit side by side on the last pew,
          staring at the front of
          the empty sanctuary. Its stained glass windows further weaken
          the late-afternoon light.
          In deference to the location, the boys wear yarmulkas.
          A long hold on their still backs.
          At length, some movement in DANNY's back, his head dips, and
          we hear him sucking on
          the joint. He holds it, exhales, and passes it wordlessly to
          Ronnie Nudell.

          SUBURBAN STREET
          We are pulling DANNY as he walks along the street, eyes red-rimmed,
          still wearing his
          yarmulka. It is dusk.
          After a few beats of walking, the front door of a house just
          behind DANNY opens. A
          husky, shaggy-haired youth emerges on the run.
          The sound has alerted DANNY. Seeing Mike Fagle, he too begins
          to run. He reaches up
          and grabs his yarmulka and clutches it in one of his pumping
          fists.
          Pursued and pursuer both run wordlessly, panting, feet pounding.
          Mike Fagle is closing. But DANNY is already cutting across the
          Brandt's front yard,
          approaching his own. He plunges into the house and slams the
          door.
          Mike Fagle draws up, panting, gazing hungrily at the house.

          

          

          

          

          42
          Lights are on inside. The house is a warm yellow citadel in the
          dusk.
          After a beat we hear, faint and dulled, the Jefferson Airplane.
          Mike Fagle slinks away.

          PUFFY WHITE CLOUDS
          A shockingly blue sky with picture-perfect clouds hanging in
          it.
          After a beat the top of an aluminum extension ladder swings in
          from the bottom of the
          frame and comes toward us.
          We cut to a side angle as the ladder clunk against a roof.
          It starts vibrating to the rhythmic clung of someone climbing.
          Hands enter. LARRY's head enters.
          He climbs onto the roof.
          He takes a couple steps away from the edge and stands tentatively,
          making sure of his
          balance. He looks around.
          His point-of-view towards the front. An unfamiliarly high perspective
          on the street and
          the neighboring houses, almost maplike. Very peaceful. Wind rhythmically,
          gently
          waves the trees.
          LARRY gingerly walks up to the aerial at the peak of the roof.
          We are hearing a rhythmic
          popping noise.
          LARRY reaches the peak and straddles it. He looks down at the
          back yard.

          MITCH
          Ow.
          Foreshortened Gar Brandt and Mitch are playing catch in their
          back yard. With each toss
          the ball pops, alternately in father's mitt and son's.
          Precariously balanced, LARRY reaches out for the aerial. He tentatively
          touches it. He
          grasps it. He twists the aerial.

          

          

          

          

          43
          Something strange: as it rotates the aerial creaks-a high whine
          as pure as the hum
          sounded from the rim of a wineglass.

          MITCH
          Ow.
          Faintly, under the wineglass sound, and clouded by static, a
          high, ringing tenor sings in
          an unfamiliar modality. Cantorial music.
          LARRY drops his hand. Inertia keeps the aerial rotating slowly
          til it dies, the sound drifting
          away into the sybillant shushing of trees.
          LARRY reaches out again to turn the aerial. The same crystal
          hum... cantorial singing...
          and now, layering in, the theme from F Troop.
          Music. Crystal hum. Wind.

          MITCH
          Ow.
          LARRY's look travels: his point-of-view pans slowly off the steep
          angle of father and son
          playing catch, travels across his own backyard, and brings in
          the white fence that
          encloses the patio of the neighbor on the other side.
          Gar (off)
          Good toss, Mitch.
          On the enclosed patio a woman reclines on a lawn chaise of nylon
          bands woven over an
          aluminum frame. She is on her back, eyes closed against the sun.
          She is naked.
          Mitch (off)
          Ow.
          LARRY reacts to the naked woman: startled at first, he moves
          to hide behind the peak of the
          roof. But as he realizes that the sun keeps the woman's eyes
          closed he relaxes, continu-
          ing to stare.
          She is attractive. Not young, not old: LARRY's age. Peaceful.
          After a still beat one of her hands gropes blindly to the side.
          It finds an ashtray on the
          table next to her and takes from it a pluming cigarette. The
          woman takes a puff and
          replaces it.

          

          

          

          

          44
          Mitch (off)
          Ow.
          F Troop. Cantorial singing.
          Blue sky and white puffy clouds.
          The sound of a pencil scratching against paper.

          NOTEBOOK
          A pencil scratches equations into a lamplit spiral notebook.
          Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut. So does the spluttering suck-sound
          of Uncle Arthur's
          evacuator.
          Wider on Uncle Arthur, in his pyjamas, propped up on the narrow
          fold-out sofa, writing
          with one hand as he holds the evacuator hose to his neck with
          the other.
          Squeezed into the living room next to the fold-out sofa is a
          camp cot of plaid-patterned
          nylon stretched over an aluminum frame. On the camp cot is LARRY,
          lying half-in, half-
          out of a rumpled sleeping bag. He stares at the ceiling, a damp
          washcloth pressed against
          his forehead. His face is flaming red.
          Arthur speaks absently as he scribbles:

          ARTHUR
          Will you read this? Tell me what you think?
          LARRY continues to stare at the ceiling.

          LARRY
          Okay.
          Uncle Arthur glances up from the notebook, focuses on LARRY.

          ARTHUR
          Boy. You should've worn a hat.

          LATER

          

          

          

          

          45
          The lights are out. Very quiet. Uncle Arthur lightly snores.
          LARRY still stares at the ceiling. He shifts his weight. The
          aluminum frame of the cot
          squeaks. He shifts again. Another creak.
          LARRY fishes his watch from the jumble of clothes on the floor:
          4:50.

          KITCHEN
          LARRY, in his underwear, spoons ground coffee into the percolator.
          Uncle Arthur snores
          softly on in the other room.
          From outside, a dull thunk.
          LARRY pulls back a curtain.
          Next door, Gar Brandt is going down the walk, wearing camouflage
          togs and camo billed
          cap, a rifle bag slung over his shoulder. He is carrying an ice
          chest, its contents clicking
          and sloshing.
          The boy Mitch, also wearing camo clothes and cap and also with
          a rifle bag, has just
          closed the front door. He now lets the screen door swing shut
          behind him and follows his
          father down the walk to the car in the driveway.
          The twitter of early morning birds. Gar's voice, though not projected,
          stands out in the
          pre-dawn quiet:

          GAR
          Let's see some hustle, Mitch.

          CLOSE ON THE NOTEBOOK
          Its top sheet, densely covered by equations, has a heading:
          The Mentaculus
          Compiled by Arthur Gopnik
          After a beat LARRY's hand enters to turn the page. The second
          page is also densely
          covered with equations.

          

          

          

          

          46

          VOICE

          LARRY?
          This brings LARRY's look up from the Mentaculus. We are in LARRY's
          office. Standing in
          the office doorway is Arlen Finkle.

          LARRY
          Hi Arlen.
          Arlen Finkle
          LARRY, I feel that, as head of the tenure committee I should
          tell you this, though it should be no cause for concern. You
          should not be at all worried.
          LARRY waits for more. Arlen seems to need a prompt.

          LARRY
          Okay.
          Arlen Finkle
          I feel I should mention it even though we won't give this
          any weight at all in considering whether to grant you
          tenure, so, I repeat no cause for concern.

          LARRY
          Okay, Arlen. Give what any weight?
          Arlen Finkle
          We have received some letters, uh... denigrating you, and,
          well, urging that we not grant you tenure.

          LARRY
          From who?
          Arlen Finkle
          They're anonymous. And so of course we dismiss them
          completely.

          LARRY
          Well... well... what do they say?
          Arlen Finkle
          They make allegations, not even allegations, assertions, but

          

          

          

          

          47
          I'm not really... while we give them no credence, LARRY,
          I'm not supposed to deal in any specifics about the
          committee's deliberations.

          LARRY
          But... I think you're saying, these won't play any part in
          your deliberations.
          Arlen Finkle
          None at all.

          LARRY
          Um, so what are they...
          Arlen Finkle
          Moral turpitude. You could say.

          LARRY
          Uh-huh. Can I ask, are they, are they-idiomatic?
          Arlen Finkle
          I, uh...

          LARRY
          The reason I ask, I have a Korean student, South Korean,
          disgruntled South Korean, and I meant to talk to you about
          this, actually, he-
          Arlen Finkle
          No. No, the letters are competently-even eloquently
          written. A native English-speaker. No question about
          that.

          LARRY
          Uh-huh.
          Arlen Finkle
          But I reiterate this, LARRY: no cause for concern. I only
          speak because I would have felt odd concealing it.

          LARRY
          Yes, okay, thank you Arlen.

          

          

          

          

          48
          Arlen Finkle
          Best to Judith.
          LARRY answers with a wan smile. He looks down at the Mentaculus.

          HEBREW SCHOOL EXTERIOR
          Day. Somewhere inside the school a bell rings. Its doors swing
          open and children
          emerge.
          Our angle is down a line of school busses, each with the the
          same stenciled Hebrew
          lettering, waiting to ferry the children home.
          We are tracking toward the busses to steepen the rake. As children
          sort themselves out
          and climb into their respective vehicles, the track brings the
          nearest bus into the fore-
          ground. It noisily idles with its signature squeaks and stress
          sounds, its low coughing
          engine ominously rumbling. Children start climbing on.

          MINUTES LATER
          Inside the bus, now moving. Engine noise bangs in louder and
          air roars in through open
          windows.
          We are on the driver, a sallow man in a short-sleeved white shirt
          with earlocks and a
          yarmulke. He pitches about, stoically wrestling with the wheel
          and gear shift as the
          vehicle bucks.
          The pitching children. Somewhere, Jefferson Airplane plays.

          DANNY
          I gotta get my radio back.
          Ronnie Nudell
          Maybe the fucker lodged it up his fucking asshole.

          DANNY
          I gotta get it back. Or Mike Fagle's gonna pound the crap
          out of me.
          Ronnie Nudell

          

          

          

          

          49
          Way up his asshole.

          DANNY
          And I'll still have to get my sister the money back or she's
          gonna break four of my records. Twenty bucks, four
          records.
          Howard Altar
          How do you buy all those records. Where do you get your
          funds.

          CLOSE ON LARRY
          Standing in his yard. His eyes are darkly pouched. He is staring
          at something, it seems
          in distress. We hear a fluttering sound.
          His point-of-view: stakes are set out in the Brandts' yard. Red
          ribbon connecting them
          outlines a projection from the side of the house. The loose ends
          of the ribbon flutter in
          the breeze.
          Engine noise brings LARRY's look around. A car is arriving.
          It is the Brandts' car, oddly burdened. As it pulls into their
          driveway we see that there is
          a four-point stag strapped to the hood, its head lolling over
          the grille.
          Gar and Mitch get out of the car in their hunting fatigues. Blood
          is smeared on Gar's
          shirt.

          GAR
          Go scrub up, Mitch.

          LARRY
          Uh, good afternoon.
          This brings Gar's look around. Apparently he is unused to talking
          with his neighbor.
          There is a short beat before his response.

          GAR
          Afternoon.
          In the background of his angle is the dead buck, staring off
          through sightless eyes.

          

          

          

          

          50

          LARRY

          (LAMELY)
          . Been hunting?

          GAR
          Yep.

          LARRY
          Is that a, uh...
          He is indicating the staked area. Gar looks around at it, looks
          back at LARRY.

          GAR
          Gonna be a den.

          LARRY
          Uh-huh, that's great. Uh, Mr. Brandt-
          Gar barks at Mitch, who has lingered to listen to the grown-ups:

          GAR
          I said scrub up, Mitch!
          The child quickly goes. LARRY frowns.

          LARRY
          Isn't this a school day?

          GAR
          Took him out of school today. So he could hunt with his
          dad.

          LARRY
          Oh!
          He nods.
          . That's.. . nice.
          Gar stares at him with button eyes. Small talk is not his thing.
          LARRY clears his throat.

          

          

          

          

          51
          . Um, Mr. Brandt, that's just about at the property line,
          there. I don't think we're supposed to get within, what, ten

          FEET

          GAR
          Property line's the poplar.

          LARRY
          . the. ?

          GAR
          Poplar!

          LARRY
          . Well.. . even if it is, you're just about over it

          GAR
          Measure.
          We hear two pairs of pounding footsteps coming up the street.

          LARRY
          I don't have to measure, you can tell it's...

          GAR
          Line's the poplar.
          He indicates.
          . It's all angles.
          Gar Brandt turns and goes.
          LARRY turns, reacting to the pounding footsteps. One of the two
          pairs belongs to DANNY
          who arrives, slowing to a walk, panting, a bookbag over his shoulder.
          A half-block back the pursuing boy also stops running. Husky,
          shaggy-haired, he
          watches, scowling, as DANNY goes up the walk to his house.
          LARRY addresses DANNY's retreating back:

          

          

          

          

          52

          LARRY
          What's going on?

          DANNY
          Nothing.

          IN THE HOUSE
          As LARRY enters.
          Judith (ofj)

          LARRY?

          LARRY

          (PROJECTING)
          Yeah?
          Judith (ofj)
          Did you go to Sieglestein Schlutz?
          No, I-not yet.

          LARRY.
          Appointment Monday.
          The thud of a car door outside.
          SARAH heads for the front door, pulling on a jacket. LARRY is
          surprised.
          . Where are you going?

          SARAH
          I'm going to the hole.

          LARRY
          At five o'clock?
          He looks out the front-door window. Four girls of SARAH's age
          are coming up the walk

          

          

          

          

          53
          from the car. All have dark hair and big noses.

          SARAH
          We're stopping at Laurie Kipperstein's house so I can wash
          my hair.
          LARRY pulls open the door just as the doorbell rings. From the
          four dark girls:

          VOICES
          Hi, Mr. Gopnik.

          LARRY
          You can't wash it here?
          From somewhere in the house, Jefferson Airplane starts.
          As she brushes past LARRY:

          SARAH
          Uncle Arthur's in the bathroom.

          VOICE
          Out in a minute!
          Judith enters.

          JUDITH
          Are you ready?

          LARRY
          Huh?

          JUDITH
          We're meeting Sy at Embers.

          LARRY
          I am?

          JUDITH
          Both of us. I told you.

          EMBERS

          

          

          

          

          54
          LARRY has his arms pinned at his sides by hugging Sy Ableman.

          SY
          LARRY. How are you.

          LARRY
          Sy.

          SY
          Hello Judith.

          JUDITH
          Hello Sy.
          Once Sy releases LARRY, all seat themselves at Sy's booth, Judith
          next to Sy, LARRY
          facing.

          SY
          Thank you for coming, LARRY. It's so impawtant that we be
          able to discuss these things.

          LARRY
          I'm happy to come to Embers, Sy, but, I'm thinking, really,
          maybe it's best to leave these discussions to the lawyers.

          SY
          Of coss! Legal matters, let the lawyers discuss! Don't mix
          apples and oranges!

          JUDITH
          I've beamed you to see the lawyer.

          LARRY
          (teeth grit)
          I told you, I'm going Monday.

          SY
          Monday is timely! This isn't-please!-Embers isn't the
          forum for legalities, you are so right!

          JUDITH
          Hmph.

          

          

          

          

          55

          SY
          No, Judith and I thought merely we should discuss the
          practicalities, the living arrangements, a situation that will
          conduce to the comfit of all the parties. This is an issue
          where no one is at odds.
          LARRY isn't sure where this is leading:

          LARRY
          . Living arrangements.

          SY
          Absolutely. I think we all agree, the children not being
          contaminated by the tension-the most impawtant.

          JUDITH
          We shouldn't put the kids in the middle of this, LARRY.

          LARRY
          The kids aren't-

          JUDITH
          I'm saying "we." I'm not pointing fingers.

          SY
          No one is playing the "blame game," LARRY.

          LARRY
          I didn't say anyone was!

          JUDITH
          Well let's not play He said, She said, either.

          LARRY
          I wasn't! I. ---

          SY
          Aw right, well let's just step back, and defuse the situation,

          LARRY.
          LARRY glares at Sy.

          

          

          

          

          56
          Sy smiles at him, sadly. He reaches over and rests a hand on
          LARRY's hand.
          . I find, sometimes, if I count to ten.
          A beat.
          One... two... three... faw... Or silently.
          Long beat.

          JUDITH
          Really, to keep things on an even keel, especially now,
          leading up to DANNY's bar mitzvah-

          SY
          A child's bar mitzvah, LARRY!

          JUDITH
          Sy and I think it's best if you move out of the house.

          LARRY
          . Move out?!

          SY
          It makes eminent sense.

          JUDITH
          Things can't continue as they-

          LARRY
          Move out! Where would I go?!

          SY
          Well, for instance, the Jolly Roger is quite livable. Not
          expensive, and the rooms are eminently livable.

          JUDITH
          This would allow you to visit the kids.

          SY
          There's convenience in its fava. There's a pool-

          LARRY

          

          

          

          

          57
          Wouldn't it make more sense for you to move in with Sy?
          Judith and Sy gape at him, shocked.
          After a long beat:

          JUDITH

          LARRY!

          SY
          LARRY, you're jesting!

          JUDITH
          LARRY, there is much to accomplish before that can happen.
          Sy is sadly shaking his head.

          SY
          LARRY, LARRY, LARRY. I think, really, the Jolly Roger is the
          appropriate coss of action.
          He shrugs.
          It has a pool.

          IN BLACK AND WHITE: A BRAIN
          It sits in a large fishbowl filled with clear fluid.
          The brain, alive, pulses. Leads connect it to various pieces
          of gear outside the fishbowl.
          Brain and appurtenances sit on a dais of sorts dressed out with
          bunting.
          Oddly, the picture is scored with cantorial singing.
          The brain seems to be giving orders to people who wear imperfectly
          form-fitting 1950's
          uniforms of the future. After receiving their instructions the
          minions of the brain
          kowtow before it and leave. They are succeeded by two leather-helmeted
          thugs, big and
          heavy though lacking muscle definition, who escort a resisting
          handsome man before the
          brain. The handsome man, hands tied behind his back, gazes defiantly
          up at the brain
          which in some fashion addresses him.
          We hear blows and voices over the cantorial music:

          

          

          

          

          58

          DANNY
          Stop it!

          SARAH
          Creep fucker!

          DANNY
          Stop it! I'm getting it! I'm gonna get it!
          Wider shows that the brain is on television, which DANNY has
          muted while he plays the
          Cantor Youssele Rosenblatt record and drills his torah portion.
          He and SARAH are in a
          stand-off, hands tensed to either deliver or ward off blows.

          SARAH
          Brat!
          LARRY enters.

          LARRY
          What's going on?

          SARAH

          (LEAVING)
          Nothing.
          She closes the door behind her.

          LARRY
          What was that?

          DANNY
          Nothing.

          LARRY
          How's the haftorah coming? Can you maybe use the hi-fi?

          DANNY
          What?
          We hear the doorbell off. LARRY indicates the portable record
          player.

          LARRY

          

          

          

          

          59
          Can I borrow this? I'm taking some stuff. To, you know,
          the Jolly Rodger.

          DANNY
          Sure Dad.
          On TV, the handsome man shouts defiance at the brain.
          From off, SARAH projects:

          SARAH
          Dad. Chinese guy.

          ASIAN MAN
          A middle-aged Korean man, well groomed. He wears a nicely cut
          suit and a jeweled tie-
          pin.

          MAN
          Culcha clash.
          He bangs his two knuckles together, illustrating.
          . Culcha clash.
          He faces LARRY in the driveway. LARRY's car is half-loaded with
          open boxes that are
          haphazardly stuffed with clothing and effects.
          LARRY is leaning against the hood, arms folded, gazing at the
          man, unimpressed. A long
          beat.
          Finally he bestirs himself.

          LARRY
          With all respect, Mr. Park, I don't think it's that.
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

          

          

          

          

          60

          LARRY
          No. It would be a culture clash if it were the custom in
          your land to bribe people for grades.
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

          LARRY
          So-you're saying it is the custom?
          Mr. Park
          No. This is defamation. Grounds for lawsuit.

          LARRY
          You-let me get this straight-you're threatening to sue
          me for defaming your son?
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

          LARRY
          But it would-
          Gar Brandt
          Is this man bothering you.
          Gar Brandt stands on the strip of lawn separating the two neighbors.
          He is giving Mr.
          Park a hard stare.

          LARRY
          Is he bothering me? No. We're fine. Thank you, Mr.
          Brandt.
          Gar Brandt, not entirely convinced, withdraws, glaring at the
          Korean.
          LARRY turns back to Mr. Park.
          . I, uh. . See, if it were defamation there would have to
          be someone I was defaming him to, or I... All right, I...
          let's keep it simple. I could pretend the money never
          appeared. That's not defaming anyone.

          

          

          

          

          BL
          Mr. Park
          Yes. And passing grade.

          LARRY
          Passing grade.
          Mr. Park
          Yes.

          LARRY
          Or you'll sue me.
          Mr. Park
          For taking money.

          LARRY
          So.. . he did leave the money.
          Mr. Park
          This is defamation.
          LARRY stares at him.

          LARRY
          Look. It doesn't make sense. Either he left the money or
          he didn't
          Mr. Park
          Please. Accept mystery.

          LARRY
          You can't have it both ways! If
          Mr. Park
          Why not.
          LARRY stares.
          We hear Sidor Belarsky music.

          RECORD PLAYER

          

          

          

          

          62
          Sidor Belarsky's singing crosses the cut. The tone arm of DANNY's
          portable record
          player rides on a spinning LP.
          Wider shows LARRY grading bluebooks at a small formica table
          crowded into a corner of
          his motel room. It is a depressingly generic budget motel room
          of the mid-sixties with
          cheaply paneled walls, thin carpet, formica night tables, plastic
          lamps, and twin beds
          with stained nubby bedspreads.
          The phone rings.

          LARRY
          Hello...
          He brightens.
          . Fine, Mimi, how are you?... Uh-huh... No, it's not
          that bad... It's not that bad... There's a pool...
          Arthur emerges from an alcove in the dim depth of the room that
          has a dressing-room
          mirror and apparently connects to the bathroom. He has a hand
          towel pressed to the
          back of his neck.
          . Oh sure, that sounds great. . . Oh, great, then I'll bring

          DANNY...

          LAKE NOKOMIS
          The beach: families are crowded onto the small beach of a freshwater
          lake, children
          cavorting, adults lounging, much sun, few umbrellas. Red floats
          connected by red nylon
          rope define a swimming area; beyond it people dive from an anchored
          raft.
          Splashing and children's laughter slap off the surface of the
          lake.

          WOODS
          Above the lake. The beach noise has some distance. It also has
          a faintly bizarre canyon
          echo. There is a present, sybillant shushing of breeze in the
          trees.
          It is dark here with intense hot spots where sun sifts through
          the leaf cover. We are close
          on DANNY, who sits very still, leaning back against a tree trunk.

          

          

          

          

          63
          After a very long beat he slowly exhales, a small amount of smoke
          feathering out with his
          breath.

          VOICE
          Gimme that fucker.
          DANNY passes the joint to Ronnie Nudell, who sits opposite.

          PICNIC AREA
          On a woodless rise above the lake. Each of the separate picnic
          areas consist of a redwood
          table and benches placed next to a firepit.
          Here in the sun both LARRY and Mel Nudell, a man slightly older
          than LARRY, glisten with
          sweat. Mel, in the background, bounces a bag of charcoal briquettes
          to spill some into
          the firepit. LARRY sits at the table in the foreground with Mimi
          Nudell who alone seems
          unaffected by the heat-or by anything else in the physical environment.
          Her pale,
          gravely composed Giacometti face is shaded by a large-brimmed
          hat.

          LARRY
          No. Almost a year and a half since Touche Ross let him
          go. He's very good with numbers. I think his, his social
          skills have held him back.

          MIMI
          Such a sweet man though.

          LARRY
          Arthur has a good heart. And he never complains, unlike
          me. Sometimes I don't give him enough credit.

          MIMI
          He tried to tell me about this thing he's working on, this,
          um...

          LARRY
          The Mentaculus? He says it's a, uh. a probability map.
          Of the universe. He asked if I could help him publish it.
          Um, it was a little hard for me to evaluate.

          

          

          

          

          64
          A beat.

          MIMI
          Does he go out socially at all?

          LARRY
          He tries. He's been going to the singles mixers at Hillel
          House.-Well, I should talk, I'm not doing any better.

          MIMI
          How is Judith?

          LARRY
          Fine. She's fine. I'm the odd man out.
          Mimi smiles.

          MIMI
          Sometimes these things just aren't meant to be. And it can
          take a while before you feel what was always there, for
          better or worse.

          LARRY
          I never felt it! It was a bolt from the blue! What does that
          mean! Everything that I thought was one way turns out to
          be another!

          MIMI
          Then-it's an opportunity to learn how things really are.
          LARRY broods. Mimi softens.
          . I'm sorry-I don't mean to sound glib. It's not always
          easy, deciphering what God is trying to tell you.

          LARRY
          I'll say.

          MIMI
          But it's not something you have to figure out all by your-
          self. We're Jews, we have that well of tradition to draw on,
          to help us understand. When we're puzzled we have all the

          

          

          

          

          65
          stories that have been handed down from people who had
          the same problems.

          LARRY
          I guess.

          MIMI
          Have you talked to Rabbi Nachtner?
          Silence.
          Arthur is climbing the hill from the lake, dripping wet. He projects:

          ARTHUR
          Boy! The air out here is magnificent!
          Mimi, looking at LARRY, responds to his dark silence:

          MIMI
          Why not see him?
          Mel Nudell has finished spreading and lighting the coals. He
          now comes and sits next to
          Mimi, draping an arm over her shoulder. She strokes his hand,
          still looking at LARRY.

          LARRY
          What's the rabbi gonna tell me?

          MIMI
          If I knew I'd be the rabbi.
          He looks at her glumly. She laughs.
          . Life is beautiful, LARRY. Nobody's sick. Nobody died.
          You just need help remembering how to enjoy it.
          She rests her head against Mel's shoulder.
          . Where are the kids?

          MEL
          Woods. Exploring.
          Uncle Arthur approaches, swim trunks plastered to his thighs,
          hair dripping, one hand

          

          

          

          

          66
          pressing his towel to the back of his neck.

          ARTHUR
          If somebody could bottle this air they'd make a million
          bucks!
          A white title comes up:
          The First Rabbi

          SYNAGOGUE OFFICE ANTEROOM
          Day. LARRY sits waiting. A door opens and he rises.

          LARRY
          Oh-Rabbi Scott.
          Rabbi Scott Ginzler is the junior rabbi, a man in his twenties.
          Rabbi Scott
          Hello LARRY.

          LARRY
          I thought I was going to see Rabbi Nachtner.
          Rabbi Scott
          He was called away on an etz monim: Ruth Brynn's mother
          is in the hospital and she isn't doing well. Rabbi Nachtner
          asked me to cover for him-come on in.

          RABBI SCOTT'S OFFICE
          A few minutes later. LARRY sits tensely hunched forward facing
          Rabbi Scott.

          LARRY
          And she wants a Gett.
          A long silence. The hum of ventilation.
          At length:

          

          

          

          

          67
          Rabbi Scott
          A what?

          LARRY
          She wants a-
          Rabbi Scott
          Oh, a Gett. Uh-huh, sure.

          LARRY
          I feel like the carpet's been yanked out from under me. I
          don't know which end is up. I'm not even sure how to
          react; I'm too confused.
          Rabbi Scott
          What reasons did she give? For the rupture?

          LARRY
          She didn't give-reasons. Just that, oh, you know, things
          haven't been going well.
          Rabbi Scott
          And is that true?

          LARRY
          I guess. I don't know. She's usually right about these
          things.
          Rabbi Scott
          Mm-hm.

          LARRY
          I feel so... addled.
          Rabbi Scott
          Yes, I can see.

          LARRY
          I was hoping that... Rabbi Nachtner...
          Rabbi Scott
          That he would... yes?

          

          

          

          

          68

          LARRY
          Well, with the benefit of his life experience... no

          OFFENSE-
          Rabbi Scott chuckles.
          Rabbi Scott
          No, of course not. I am the junior rabbi. And it's true, the
          point-of-view of somebody who's older and perhaps had
          similar problems might be more valid. And you should see
          the senior rabbi as well, by all means. Or even Minda if
          you can get in, he's quite busy. But maybe-can I share
          something with you? Because I too have had the feeling of
          losing track of Hashem, which is the problem here. I too
          have forgotten how to see Him in the world. And when
          that happens you think, well, if I can't see Him, He isn't
          there any more, He's gone. But that's not the case. You
          just need to remember how to see Him. Am I right?
          He rises and goes to the window.
          I mean, the parking lot here. Not much to see.
          It is a different angle on the same parking lot we saw from the
          Hebrew school window.
          But if you imagine yourself a visitor, somebody who
          isn't familiar with these... autos and such... somebody
          still with a capacity for wonder... Someone with a fresh...
          perspective. That's what it is, LARRY.

          LARRY
          Um...
          Rabbi Scott
          Because with the right perspective you can see Hashem,
          you know, reaching into the world. He is in the world, not
          just in shul. It souunds to me like you're looking at the
          world, looking at your wife, through tired eyes. It sounds
          like she's become a sort of... thing... a problem... a
          thing...

          LARRY
          Well, she's, she's seeing Sy Ableman.

          

          

          

          

          69
          Rabbi Scott
          Oh.

          LARRY
          She's, they're planning, that's why they want the Gett.
          Rabbi Scott
          Oh. I'm sorry.

          LARRY
          It was his idea.
          Rabbi Scott
          Well, they do need a Gett to remarry in the faith. But this
          is life. For you too. You can't cut yourself off from the
          mystical or you'll be-you'll remain-completely lost.
          You have to see these things as expressions of God's will.
          You don't have to like it, of course.

          LARRY
          The boss isn't always right, but he's always the boss.
          Rabbi Scott
          Ha-ha-ha! That's right, things aren't so bad. Look at the
          parking lot, LARRY.
          Rabbi Scott gazes out, marveling.
          . Just look at that parking lot.

          EXTERIOR: GOPNIK HOUSE
          Our low angle looks across the lawn toward the front of the house.
          Someone's pounding
          footsteps approach and his feet enter just off the lens and he
          quickly recedes, cropping in
          as he races up to the house: DANNY.
          A beat later pursuing feet enter, slowing-for DANNY is already
          mounting the front
          stoop. DANNY's pursuer does not go deep enough to crop in but
          we might gather from
          the size eleven sneakers and the cuffed jeans that it is hulking
          Mike Fagle.

          

          

          

          

          70

          GOPNIK KITCHEN
          We hear the front door being flung open and slammed shut, and
          in the background foyer
          DANNY appears, panting heavily. He gives one glance back toward
          the front door and
          then looks at his mother and sister eating soup in the foreground.
          His sister has a towel
          wrapped turbanlike around her head. She holds it with one hand
          to keep it from tipping
          off when she tilts her head down for the soup.

          DANNY
          (still panting)
          We eating already?

          SARAH
          I'm going to the hole.
          DANNY enters the kitchen and sits at the setting across from
          his sister. He picks up his
          spoon.
          Some movement in SARAH's body; DANNY recoils from a kick.

          DANNY
          Ow! Cut it out!

          JUDITH
          What's going on?
          The siblings slurp soup, neither answering.
          After a couple slurps:
          . Isn't Dad eating?

          JUDITH
          He's at the Jolly Roger.

          DANNY
          Oh yeah.
          More eating.

          FADE OUT

          

          

          

          

          71

          SIEGLESTEIN, SCHLUTZ
          In a small windowless conference room lined by bookshelves filled
          with law reference
          books, LARRY rises to greet Don Milgram, entering.

          LARRY
          Don.

          DON
          How are you, LARRY, Jesus, I am so sorry to be seeing you
          under these circumstances.

          LARRY
          Oh, well...

          DON
          I always thought you and JUDY were rock solid. This is so
          terrible, LARRY. This is devastating.

          LARRY
          Well, the way I look at it, it's an opportunity for me to
          really sit down and figure things out, and, and, look at the
          world afresh instead of just, you know, settling for the
          routine, tired old way of looking at things.
          Don Milgram stares at him.

          DON
          . Really?

          LARRY

          (DEFLATING)
          I don't know. Maybe not.

          DON
          Well, legally, I have to warn you, it's never easy for the
          husband. Unless, of course, there's some question of the
          wife having violated the marriage contract.

          LARRY
          Oh no, nothing like that. She's planning to marry Sy
          Ableman, but they-

          

          

          

          

          72

          DON
          Sy Ableman!

          LARRY
          Yes, but they-

          DON
          Esther is barely cold!

          LARRY
          She passed three years ago.

          DON
          Well, okay, still-this changes the complexion, LARRY! Sy
          Ableman!

          LARRY
          Not in the sense that... there hasn't been hanky-panky. To
          my knowledge.

          DON
          Oh.

          LARRY
          No. I'm fairly certain this is not an issue. And in fact they,
          uh, Judith wants a Gett.
          Beat. Don stares blankly at LARRY.
          LARRY clears his throat.
          A ritual divorce.

          DON
          Oh.

          LARRY
          So that they can remarry in the faith-

          DON
          Uh-huh, sure, not really a legal matter. Okay. Well. My
          goodness. How are the children taking it?

          

          

          

          

          73

          LARRY
          Oh, they're very...
          He gropes.
          . resilient.

          DON
          Good. Well. On the other thing, the neighbor's property
          line, I've asked Solomon Schlutz to take a look. There's
          very little having to do with real estate that'll get by Sol.

          LARRY
          Okay. Good. How do you-I guess I'm a little worried,
          how do you, I have money pressures and-

          DON
          Our fee structure? We bill by the hour. Dave Sieglestein
          and Solomon Schlutz bill at a hundred and ten, the associ-
          ates, me for instance, bill at
          A secretary sticks her head in.

          SECRETARY
          A call for Mr. Gopnik. DANNY. At home.

          LARRY

          DANNY? !

          DON
          You can take it here.

          SECRETARY
          Oh-eight-oh-nine.
          LARRY punches a button on a row of four on the conference-room
          telephone.

          LARRY

          DANNY? !

          VOICE
          Dad?

          

          

          

          

          74

          LARRY
          Are you all right? Are you all-is everything-

          VOICE
          F Troop is fuzzy.

          LARRY
          . What?

          VOICE
          F Troop is still fuzzy.
          LARRY stares.

          DON
          Everything okay?

          DAWN AT THE JOLLY ROGER
          Wide on the motel room, dimly lit by weak sun starting to seep
          in around the curtain.
          LARRY sleeps in one of the twin beds; Uncle Arthur snores in
          the other.
          Uncle Arthur's breath snags and tangles on a snorfling inhale
          and it wakes him, gagging.
          He blinks, sits up, swings his legs out, gazes blearily around
          the room.
          He rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom.
          LARRY stirs. The sound of Uncle Arthur urinating. LARRY looks
          blearily around.
          LARRY stiffly rises. He takes the two steps across the room to
          the formica desk on which
          are spread papers for his class. As we hear the sucking sound
          of the neck evacuator in
          the bathroom, LARRY sweeps papers together and mechanically stuffs
          his briefcase.

          CAR
          LARRY is driving, hollow-eyed, to work.
          After a long beat of staring, the ka-ching of a bicycle bell.

          

          

          

          

          75
          LARRY's eyes widen and his head swivels, tracking as he overtakes
          and passes:
          The bicyclist. A young Asian man wearing a white traffic-mask.
          LARRY looks at him in the rear-view.

          LARRY

          CLIVE!
          He starts frantically pumping down his window, shouting:
          . CLIVE! You gonna send your mother next?! You little
          bastard! I wanna see you! I wanna-
          Crash.
          He has rear-ended someone.
          A blaring horn, a quick second crash: wrenching steel and spattering
          glass.
          He has been rear-ended in turn.
          The ka-ching of the bicycle. CLIVE Park cycles past without looking.

          BLEGEN HALL
          LARRY enters the outer office, hugging his paper-stuffed briefcase
          to his chest.
          The secretary is just crooking the phone into her shoulder.

          SECRETARY
          Oh-Professor Gopnik. It's Dick Dutton again.

          LARRY

          (BLANK)
          Dick Dutton.

          LARRY'S OFFICE
          He sits in and picks up the phone.

          

          

          

          

          76

          LARRY
          Hello?

          VOICE
          Hello, Mr. Gopnik, this is Dick Dutton from the Columbia
          Record Club. I'm calling because it is now, what, four
          months and we have yet to receive your first payment.

          LARRY
          I-there's some mistake. I'm not a member of the
          Columbian Record Club.

          VOICE
          Sir, you are Lawrence Gopnik of 1425 Flag Avenue South?

          LARRY
          No, I live at the Jolly Roger.

          VOICE
          Excuse me?

          LARRY
          No, I-well, yes, okay.

          VOICE
          Yes you are Lawrence Gopnik?

          LARRY
          Okay.

          VOICE
          Okay means...

          LARRY
          Okay, yes, Lawrence Gopnik, yes.

          VOICE
          Okay, well, you received your twelve introductory albums
          and you have been receiving the monthly main selection for
          four months now-

          LARRY
          "The monthly main selection?" Is that a record? I didn't

          

          

          

          

          77
          ask for any records.

          VOICE
          To receive the monthly main selection you do nothing.

          YOU-

          LARRY
          That's right! I haven't done anything!

          VOICE
          Yes, that's why you receive the monthly main selection.
          The last

          LARRY
          But I-

          VOICE
          The last one was Santana Abraxis. You-

          LARRY
          I didn't ask for Santana Abraxis!

          VOICE
          You request the main selection at the retail price by doing
          nothing. It is automatically mailed to you. Plus shipping
          and handling. You're about to-

          LARRY
          I can't afford a new record every month! I haven't asked

          FOR-

          VOICE
          You're about to get Cosmo's Factory, sir. The June main
          selection. And you haven't-

          LARRY
          Look, something is very wrong! I don't want Santana
          Abraxis! I've just been in a terrible auto accident!
          Beat.

          VOICE
          I'm sorry sir.

          

          

          

          

          78

          LARRY
          Well-thank you. But I-

          VOICE
          Are you okay?

          LARRY
          Yes. Yes, no one was hurt.

          VOICE
          Okay. Good. Well, you had fourteen days to listen to
          Santana Abraxis and return it if you weren't completely
          satisfied. You did nothing. And now you-

          LARRY
          I didn't ask for Santana Abraxis! I didn't listen to Santana
          Abraxis! I didn't do anything!
          The secretary is sticking her head in.

          SECRETARY
          Sir.

          VOICE
          Sir. Please. We can't make you listen to the record. We-

          SECRETARY
          Professor Gopnik, your son. He said it's urgent.

          LARRY
          Okay, look, I have to call you back, this is, this is I'm
          sorry.
          He irritably punches a button on the bottom row of four.

          DANNY?

          DANNY
          Dad!

          LARRY
          Did you join the Columbia Record Club?!

          

          

          

          

          79
          Silence.

          . DANNY?

          DANNY
          Um...

          LARRY
          DANNY, this is completely unacceptable. I can't afford to-

          DANNY
          Okay Dad, but you gotta come home.

          LARRY
          Is it F Troop?

          DANNY
          Huh? No no. Mom's real upset.

          GOPNIK HOUSE
          LARRY enters. We can hear weeping, semi-hysterical, from somewhere
          in the house.
          SARAH's Voice
          .Dad?

          LARRY
          Yes?
          She enters.

          SARAH
          Does this mean I can't go to the hole tonight?

          LARRY
          Does what mean-what happened?

          SARAH
          Sy Ableman died in a car crash.
          DANNY's Voice

          

          

          

          

          80
          Hey Dad!

          LARRY
          What?!
          DANNY enters.

          DANNY
          So are you coming back home? Can you fix the aerial?
          The weeping, off, grows louder and more hysterical.

          LARRY
          What?!

          DANNY
          It's still, you know...
          Loud wailing.

          BLACK
          After a beat in black, a white title:
          The Second Rabbi
          The title fades.

          RABBI'S OFFICE
          We are close on LARRY. He sits hunched forward, hands clasped
          in front of him, staring at
          the floor, sadly shaking his head.
          After a long beat:

          LARRY
          It seems like she's asking an awful lot. But then-I don't
          know. Somebody has to pay for Sy's funeral.
          Rabbi Nachtner, sitting opposite, nods.
          Rabbi Nachtner

          

          

          

          

          81
          Uh-huh.

          LARRY
          His own estate is in probate. But why does it have to be
          me? Or is it wrong to complain? JUDY says it is. But I'm
          so strapped for cash right now-paying for the Jolly Roger,
          and I wrecked the car, and DANNY's bar mitzvah... I...
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Something like this-there's never a good time.

          LARRY
          I don't know where it all leaves me. Sy's death. Obviously
          it's not going to go back like it was.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Mm. Would you even want that, LARRY?

          LARRY
          No, I-well yeah! Sometimes! Or-I don't know; I guess
          the honest answer is I don't know. What was my life
          before? Not what I thought it was. What does it all mean?
          What is Hashem trying to tell me, making me pay for Sy
          Ableman's funeral?
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Mm.

          LARRY
          And-did I tell you I had a car accident the same time Sy
          had his? The same instant, for all I know. Is Hashem
          telling me that Sy Ableman is me, or we are all one or
          something?
          Rabbi Nachtner
          How does God speak to us: it's a good question. You
          know Lee Sussman?

          LARRY
          DOCTOR Sussman? I think I-yeah.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Did he ever tell you about the goy's teeth?

          

          

          

          

          82

          LARRY
          No... I-What goy?
          Rabbi Nachtner
          So Lee is at work one day; you know he has the orthodontic
          practice there at Texa-Tonka.

          LARRY
          Uh-huh.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Right next to the Gold Eagle Cleaners.
          We cut to:

          SIGN FOR THE GOLD EAGLE CLEANERS
          It dominates a small suburban strip mall.
          Rabbi Nachtner continues in voice-over as we cut to a smoked
          glass door that identifies
          Leon Sussman, DDS.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          He's making a plaster mold-it's for corrective bridge
          work-in the mouth of one of his patients...
          A close shot of a man's mouth biting down on two horse-shoe shaped
          troughs-an upper
          and a lower-that overflow an oozing white goo.
          . Russell Kraus. He's a delivery dispatcher for the Star
          and Tribune with chronic mandicular deterioration.
          The grinding guitar solo from Jefferson Airplane's "Bear Melt"
          scores the narrative.
          The patient opens his mouth as a hand enters to grab the upper
          tray.
          The reverse shows Dr. Sussman, a balding middle-aged man, dressed
          in the the high-
          collared white smock of an oral surgeon. He carries the mold
          over to a drying table.
          Kraus is twisted over the side of the chair spitting into the
          water-swirled spit-sink.
          . Well, the mold dries and Lee is examining it one day

          

          

          

          

          83
          before fabricating an appliance...
          Another day: Dr. Sussman is sitting at his desk examining the
          lower mold. He notices
          something unusual.
          . He notices something unusual.
          Sussman reaches up for the loupe attached to his eyeglasses.
          There seems to be something engraved on the inside of the
          patient's lower incisors...
          He flips down the loupe. His eyes are hugely magnified as he
          stares.
          Sure enough, it's writing.
          Sussman squints.
          His point-of-view: Tiny incised Hebrew letters:
          smlï¿½nn

          BACK TO RABBI NACHTNER
          He confirms with a nod.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          This in a goy's mouth, LARRY.

          BACK TO LEON SUSSMAN
          The Rabbi's narrative continues.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Tet resh nun lamed nun shin tsayin. What is that-tiranu
          linoshets? "Help me"? Is that what it says? Or is it a
          name? It's not Kraus's name.
          Sussman flips the loupe away and looks off, haunted. He rises.
          He checks the mold, just to be sure. Oh, it's there all

          

          

          

          

          84
          right...
          A dental mirror is dipped into the horse-shoe-shaped hardened
          paste of the mold. It pans
          tiny letters that stand out in relief, right-side around in the
          mirror:
          yw .rin
          Sussman leans back, thinking.
          He calls the goy back on the pretense of needing additional
          measurements for the appliance...
          Close on Kraus grinning as he shakes Sussman's hand in the reception
          area. Sussman
          gestures to invite Kraus back to the examination room.
          Sussman chats, affecting nonchalance.
          In the examination room, leaning over Kraus in the chair, the
          dentist is indeed chatting
          with seeming casualness.
          Notice any other problems with your teeth? Anything
          peculiar, et cetera?
          Sussman takes a dental mirror.
          No. No. No. Visited any other dentist recently?
          He looks in Kraus' mouth with the mirror:
          Ym nn
          Sussman frowns.
          There it is. "Help me"?
          He leans back.
          Sussman goes home. Can Sussman eat? No.
          Sussman sits at the kitchen table, untouched food in front of
          him. His wife chats volubly
          while Sussman stares into space.
          Can Sussman sleep? No.

          

          

          

          

          85
          Sussman is in bed, pyjamas buttoned to the neck, staring at the
          ceiling.
          What does it mean? Is it a message for him, for Sussman?
          And if so, from whom? Does Sussman know? Sussman
          doesn't know.
          Back in the dental office Sussman pulls boxes containing other
          molds off the shelf.
          Sussman looks at the molds of his other patients, goy and
          Jew alike, seeking other messages. He finds none. He
          looks in his own mouth...
          Close on Sussman in front of a mirror straining to see the reflection
          of a reflection of the
          dental mirror he holds in his own mouth.
          . Nothing. His wife's mouth...
          Sussman's wife lies asleep on her back, her mouth open, snoring
          softly. Sussman, in
          pyjamas but with his glasses on and loupe in place, lies over
          her in bed, supporting
          himself with one arm thrown across her body. He leans awkwardly
          in, carefully
          lowering a dental mirror into his wife's open mouth.
          . Nothing. It is a singular event. A mystery.
          The Jefferson Airplane guitar solo is heating up.
          But Sussman is an educated man. Not the world's greatest
          sage, maybe, no Rabbi Minda, but he knows a thing or two
          from the Zohar and the Caballah. He knows every Hebrew
          letter has its numeric equivalent.
          Sussman, still in his pyjamas is sitting at the kitchen table
          scribbling on a tablet of lined
          paper.
          Close on the paper: the Hebrew letters have been transcribed
          into their numeric

          EQUIVALENTS:

          496-2428
          Nachtner continues in voice-over:

          

          

          

          

          86
          Seven digits-a phone number maybe?
          Sussman reaches for the phone. He hesitates a moment, then dials.
          . Sussman dials. It rings.

          AN ELEVATED CUBICLE
          In a grocery store. A man in short sleeves reaches for the phone.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          It's a Red Owl grocery store in Bloomington. Hello? Do
          you know a goy named Kraus? Russel Kraus?
          The store manager is shaking his head.
          Where have I called? The Red Owl. In Bloomington.
          Thanks so much.
          The manager, puzzled, hangs up.
          Sussman thinks, am I supposed to go to the Red Owl, to
          receive a further sign? He goes...
          In the parking lot of the Red Owl Sussman, wearing a short-brimmed
          fedora, emerges
          from his car. It is an unremarkable grocery store in a suburban
          mall.
          It's a Red Owl.
          Inside Sussman, in his fedora, gazes around.
          Groceries. What have you.
          A service alley behind the store: dumpsters, wind-blown garbage,
          Sussman looking.
          On the wall behind the store, a stain...
          There is an old, rather nondescript stain of some liquid splatted
          against the back wall and
          long since dribbled away.
          . Could be a nun sofit... Or maybe not...
          The parking lot again: Sussman gets back in his car.

          

          

          

          

          87
          Sussman goes home. What does it mean? He has to find
          out, if he's ever to sleep again.
          Sussman again, in pyjamas buttoned to the neck, lies in his bed
          staring at the ceiling.
          He goes to see the Rabbi, Nachtner. He comes in and sits
          right where you're sitting now.
          Sussman is indeed sitting across from Rabbi Nachtner, just where
          we've seen LARRY
          sitting.
          What does it mean, Rabbi? Is it a sign from Hashem?
          "Help me." I, Sussman, should be doing something to help
          this goy? Doing what? The teeth don't say. I should know
          without asking? Or maybe I'm supposed to help people
          generally-lead a more righteous life? Is the answer in
          cabalah? In torah? Or is there even a question? Tell me,
          Rabbi-what can such a sign mean?
          Nachtner-not the narrating Nachtner but the Nachtner in the scene-nods
          and
          considers.

          LARRY
          Staring at the Rabbi. He waits a good beat.
          He prompts:

          LARRY
          So what did you tell him?
          The Rabbi seems surprised by the question.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Sussman?

          LARRY
          Yes!
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Is it. . relevant?

          

          

          

          

          88

          LARRY
          Well-isn't that why you're telling me?
          Rabbi Nachtner
          Mm. Okay. Nachtner says, look.. .
          We are back in the scene, narrated by voice-over, of the Rabbi
          silently advising the
          fretful Sussman.
          . The teeth, we don't know. A sign from Hashem, don't
          know. Helping others, couldn't hurt.
          LARRY's voice-over question plays over Sussman asking the same
          thing:
          LARRY (of])
          But is that what it meant?-tet resh nun lamed nun shin
          isayin, was it "Help me"? or a number? Or was it
          Rabbi Nachtner (off)
          We can't know everything.
          Sussman stares blankly at the Rabbi.
          A beat.
          LARRY (of])
          It sounds like you don't know Mthing!

          THE RABBI
          Smiling equably at LARRY. He reacts to the ejaculation with a
          shrug.
          LARRY scowls.

          LARRY
          Why even tell me the story?
          Rabbi Nachtner

          (AMUSED)
          First I should tell you, then I shouldn't.

          

          

          

          

          89
          LARRY, exasporated, changes tack:

          LARRY
          What happened to Sussman?

          SUSSMAN
          In his office. Working on different patients as the Rabbi resumes
          his voice-over.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          What would happen? Not much. He went back to work.
          For a while he checked every patient's teeth for new
          messages; didn't see any; in time, he found he'd stopped
          checking.
          Sussman, at home, chats with his wife over dinner.
          . These questions that are bothering you, LARRY-maybe
          they're like a toothache. We feel them for a while, then
          they go away.
          Sussman lies in bed sleeping, smiling, an arm thrown across his
          wife.

          LARRY
          Dissatisfied.

          LARRY
          I don't want it to just go away! I want an answer!
          Rabbi Nachtner
          The answer! Sure! We all want the answer! But Hashem
          doesn't owe us the answer, LARRY. Hashem doesn't owe us
          anything. The obligation runs the other way.

          LARRY
          Why does he make us feel the questions if he's not gonna
          give us any answers?
          Rabbi Nachtner smiles at LARRY for a beat.

          

          

          

          

          90
          Rabbi Nachtner
          He hasn't told me.
          LARRY rubs his face, frustrated.
          A last question occurs to him:

          LARRY
          And what happened to the goy?
          Rabbi Nachtner's forebearing smile fades into puzzlement.
          Rabbi Nachtner
          The goy? Who cares?

          EXTERIOR: THE SYNAGOGUE
          The modern synagogue grafted onto a patch of prairie.
          An echoing voice rings out:

          VOICE
          Sy Ableman was a serious man!

          RABBI NACHTNER
          In close-up he gazes around, weighing the effect of the words
          just delivered.
          After a long beat during which he seeks to establish eye contact
          with as much of his
          audience as possible:
          Rabbi Nachtner
          . Sy Ableman was a man devoted to his community...
          Wider shows Rabbi Nachtner up on the bema. He and the congregation
          face each other
          across a casket down at floor level.
          . to torah study...
          LARRY sits among the congregants, his gaze fixed on a point off.

          

          

          

          

          91
          . to his beloved wife Esther until, three years ago, she
          passed.. .
          LARRY's point-of-view: JUDY is visible from 3 behind. She sits
          a few rows ahead looking
          grimly up at the rabbi.
          . and to his duty, as he saw it. Where does such a man
          go? A tzadik-who knows, maybe even a lamid vovnik-a
          man beloved by all, a man who despised the frivolous?
          Could such a serious man... simply... disappear?
          The words echo.
          Again the rabbi gazes around, as if awaiting answer.

          THEN:
          . We speak of L'olam ha-ba, the World to Come. Not
          heaven. Not what the gentiles think of as afterlife.
          "L'olam ha-ba." What is L'olam ha-ba? Where is L'olam
          ha-ba? Well: it is not a geoaraphic place, certainly.
          Like-Canada.
          Murmured chuckles from the congregation.
          Nor is it the eretz zavat chalav ood'vash-the land flowing
          with milk and honey, for we are not promised a personal
          reward, a gold star, a first-class VIP lounge where we get
          milk and cookies to eternity!
          More chuckles.
          L'olam ha-ba... is in the bosom of Abraham. L'olam ba-
          ba is in the soul of this community which nurtured Sy
          Ableman and to which Sy Ableman now returns. That's
          right, he returns. Because he still inspires us Ableman
          returns. Because his memory instructs us Ableman
          returns. Because his thoughts illuminate our days and ways
          Sy Ableman returns. The frivolous man may vanish
          without a ripple but Sy Ableman? Sy Ableman was a
          serious man...

          

          

          

          

          92
          A sob echoes through the sanctuary.
          LARRY looks at Judith, who stifles further sobs with a handkerchief.
          . As you know, the mourner's kaddish does not mention
          the dead. It praises Hashem; it praises what abides. And
          Sy Ableman, whose spirit will continue to assist us in
          tikkun olam, is with us even now, a serious man who would
          say as we now say Yiskadal v'yiskadash sh'may rabah...
          The congregation begins to chant along but it and Judith's weeping
          are cut off by:

          A HAND RAPPING AT A DOOR
          The front door to the Gopnik home.
          LARRY, still in his suit from shul and wearing a yarmulka, opens
          the door. He recoils in
          surprise edged with fear.
          Reverse: two uniformed policemen.

          COP 1
          Arthur Gopnik?
          LARRY is momentarily dumb. Inside the house we can see a corner
          of a card table set up in
          the living room with food laid out on it. SARAH sits with her
          back to us, head wrapped by
          a towel-turban. Arthur, on the far side of the table, his balding
          head domed by a yarmul-
          ka, half-leans out so that he may sneak looks toward the men
          at the door without totally
          revealing himself. From somewhere down the hall come Judith's
          muffled sobs.
          . Are you Arthur Gopnik?

          LARRY
          I'm... Laurence Gopnik.
          Cop I
          Do you go by the name Arthur Gopnik?

          LARRY
          No.

          

          

          

          

          93

          COP 1
          Is that Arthur Gopnik?
          Arthur ducks away.
          From inside the living room:
          DANNY (off)
          Dad? What's going on?

          LARRY
          Can you tell me what's going on. We're sitting shiva here.

          COP 1
          You're what.

          LARRY
          A religious observance. We're... bereaved.
          The cop standing behind gazes in over his partner's shoulder.

          COP 2
          Who died?

          LARRY
          My wife's um... it's a long story.

          COP 1
          Look. Tell Gopnik-you know, Arthur Gopnik-he's
          breaking the law. We're not arresting him now but next
          time we will. Gambling is against the law in this state.
          That's just the way it is. All right. Go back to your...

          COP 2
          Sorry, sir.

          LIVING ROOM
          A minute later. The family-except for Judith, whose weeping continues
          off-sits
          around the card table. A long beat.
          At length:

          

          

          

          

          94

          DANNY
          Dad, we get Channel 4 now but not Channel 7.

          LARRY
          Arthur, how could you do that to this family. On Sy's...
          on Sy's-

          ARTHUR
          It's a victimless crime.

          LARRY
          That doesn't make it right! And you-

          DANNY
          He won a lot of money, Dad! The Mentaculus really
          works!
          LARRY's gaze swings onto his son.

          LARRY
          You knew about it?!

          DANNY
          Well, um...

          ARTHUR
          They must have finked me out. They knew I could just
          keep on winning, so a couple weeks ago they blackballed
          me, and now they've-

          LARRY
          What did you do with the money you won?
          Silence. Arthur sneaks a look at DANNY.
          LARRY looks back and forth between them.
          . What's going on?
          Arthur shrugs.

          ARTHUR

          

          

          

          

          95
          I didn't want it. DANNY said he could use it

          SARAH
          Unfair!

          LARRY
          What have you been-

          ARTHUR
          What's unfair is these guys saying I can't play in their card
          game!

          SARAH
          Why give him the money?! You know what he spends it
          on?

          LARRY
          (knowing nod)
          I know about the records.

          SARAH
          Records?! You think he buys records from Mike Fagle?
          Movement in DANNY's body; SARAH recoils from a kick.
          . Ow! Little brat!

          LARRY
          Hey! What's going on!

          DANNY
          At least I'm not saving up for a nose job!

          LARRY
          What?!

          SARAH
          Brat!

          LARRY
          Nobody in this house is getting a nose job! You got that?!

          

          

          

          

          96

          DANNY
          Ali!
          Struck by a thought he leaps up and bolts from the room.

          LARRY
          DANNY! You weren't excused! We're still talking!

          SARAH
          What a brat.

          LARRY
          What was this card game, Arthur?

          ARTHUR
          Some goys run a private game.
          We hear the TV go on down the hall and the theme from F Troop.
          I think they're Italians.

          LARRY
          DANNY, what's going on!
          He rises.

          BEDROOM
          LARRY enters to look down at DANNY's back. Beyond him F Troop
          flickers on the TV.

          LARRY
          DANNY! We're sitting Shiva!

          DON MILGRAM'S OFFICE
          LARRY, sitting across from Don, has his head buried in his arms
          on the desktop.

          DON
          She's retained Barney Silver at Tuchman, Marsh. This is a,
          uh--this is an aggressive firm, LARRY.

          

          

          

          

          97

          LARRY

          (MUFFLED)
          Uh-huh.

          DON
          These are not pleasant people. Judith is free of course to
          retain whoever she... I take it you don't talk to her?
          LARRY raises his head, squinting against the light.

          LARRY
          It's hard. I think she emptied our bank account. I tried to
          ask her about it, very civilly.

          DON
          Mm.

          LARRY
          She, uh...

          DON
          Yeah, yeah you better open an account in your name only,
          put your paychecks in there from here on out. Til we know
          where we stand.

          LARRY
          Can I?

          DON
          Oh, absolutely!

          LARRY
          That's not, um, dishonest?

          DON
          Oh, absolutely! You, uh-

          LARRY
          I hate to say this, but I think she's also been sneaking cash
          out of my wallet.

          DON
          Ouch. Well, yes, this is definitely, um, adversarial. The

          

          

          

          

          98
          first thing we-are you all right?
          LARRY is wincing as he rubs a forearm under his shirtsleeve.

          LARRY
          Just a sunburn. I've been spending a lot of time on the
          roof. For... perspective.
          He trails off and his head drops back down onto his arms. Don
          gives him an appraising
          look.

          DON
          . Have you seen the Rabbi?

          LARRY
          (muffled again)
          Talked to Nachtner.

          DON
          You should talk to Minda.

          LARRY
           They told me Minda doesn't do pastoral work any more.
          Just.. . ceremonial.

          DON
          Mm. Congratulates the bar mitzvah boy every week, so
          forth?
          LARRY nods miserably.
          . That's too bad. A very wise man, Minda.
          LARRY raises his head.

          LARRY
          Getting old.

          DON
          Very old.

          LARRY
          No, me.

          

          

          

          

          99

          DON
          LARRY, you're fine. It's a bump in the road. Was Nachtner
          helpful at all?
          LARRY gives a helpless shrug.
          Don rolls his eyes.
          . What-did he tell you about the goy's teeth?
          A knock on the door. Don projects:
          Yeah?
          The door cracks open. A pipe edges in, followed by a peeking
          face: Solomon Schlutz.
          . Oh, good! Sol, come on in.
          Solomon Schlutz is a large man in shirtsleeves and suspenders.
          He has the smooth
          impassive face of a sphynx with a pipe clenched in its teeth.
          He glides into the room, a sheaf of files tucked under one arm.
          . Sol has been looking into the property-line issues.. .
          Solomon Schlutz seats himself at the conference table and starts
          sorting and arranging
          the files into three piles.
          . It seems that you do have a real problem with the
          original survey. But Sol seems to think there's some kind
          of nifty way for us to-well, I haven't heard it myself, I'll
          let Sol map it out.
          Solomon Schlutz continues to arrange the files, his eye occasionally
          lingering on a
          specific page. When at length he is finished he carefully justifies
          the edges of the closest
          pile, takes the pipe out of his mouth, gives LARRY a smile that
          seems to take some effort,
          and then taps the pipe in a large glass ashtray.
          He looks up again at LARRY, this time shocked. His stunned look
          on LARRY holds for a
          long beat.
          LARRY returns a bewildered look.

          

          

          

          

          100
          Solomon Schlutz, staring at LARRY as if he were some sort of
          monster, emits one barking

          SYLLABLE:
          Solomon Schlutz
          Gah!
          His stare holds. He reddens.

          DON
          .Sol?
          Solomon Schlutz's face now passes from the red end of the spectrum
          to the purple.
          Solomon Schlutz
          Nnnnff!
          The pipe clatters out of his hand. The hand grabs at his own
          shirt front.
          . Glufffl...
          Now his head pitches back. His backflung weight and twisting
          body send his chair
          tipping over, one hand still clutching at his chest while the
          other frantically waves. He
          disappears behind the conference table and lands with a floor-shaking
          thump. His
          writhing and gurgling remain audible.

          DON
          Sol! Sol!
          Don Milgram has risen to look down at his fallen colleague; now
          he flings open the
          conference room door and bellows into the office:
          An ambulance! Quick! Somebody call an ambulance! A

          DOCTOR!
          A secretary looks in and screams.
          Solomon Schlutz
          Garf!... Nnlogl...

          BLEGEN HALL

          

          

          

          

          101
          LARRY walks into the outer office clutching his briefcase, eyes
          wide, shell-shocked. The
          secretary is at her typewriter but holding the phone, one hand
          covering its mouthpiece.

          SECRETARY
          Dick Dutton. Columbia Record Club.

          LARRY
          Call back.

          HIS OFFICE
          LARRY sits in heavily behind his desk.
          A beat.
          He opens the top left desk drawer. He withdraws the bulging white
          envelope and opens
          its flap.
          He runs a finger over the wad of bills.

          VOICE

          LARRY?
          He looks up, startled.
          Arlen Finkle stands in the doorway.
          . As you know, the tenure committee meets-are you all
          right?
          LARRY sits frozen with the white envelope in his hands.

          LARRY
          I'm... fine.
          Arlen Finkle
          I'm sorry. I know you've hit a rough patch.

          LARRY
          Thank you. I'm fine.
          He puts the envelope in the desk drawer and closes it.

          

          

          

          

          102
          Arlen Finkle
          Uh-huh. Well. As you know, the tenure committee meets
          next Wednesday to make its final determinations. If

          THERE'S-

          LARRY
          Arlen, I am not an evil man!
          Arlen looks at him, shocked.
          Arlen Finkle
          LARRY! Of course not!

          LARRY
          I am not-
          Arlen Finkle
          We don't make moral judgments!

          LARRY
          I went to the Aster Art once. I saw Swedish Reverie.
          Arlen Finkle
          It's okay, LARRY, we don't need to know! The Tenure

          COMMITTEE-

          LARRY
          It wasn't even erotic! Although it was, in a way.
          Arlen Finkle
          It's all right, LARRY. Believe me.
          LARRY calms somewhat.

          LARRY
          . Okay.
          Arlen Finkle
          Okay. Okay. We, uh, we decide on Wednesday, so if
          there's anything you want to submit in support of your
          tenure application, we should have it by then. That's all.

          LARRY

          

          

          

          

          103
          Submit. What. What do you-
          Arlen Finkle
          Well. Anything. Published work. Anything else you've
          done outside of the institution. Any work that we might not
          be aware of.

          LARRY
          I haven't done anything.
          Arlen Finkle
          Uh-huh.

          LARRY
          I haven't published.
          Arlen Finkle
          Uh-huh.

          LARRY
          Are you still getting those letters?
          Arlen Finkle
          Uh-huh.

          LARRY
          Those anonymous-
          Arlen Finkle
          Yes, I know. Yes.
          A beat. LARRY nods.

          LARRY
          Okay. Okay. Wednesday.
          Arlen Finkle
          Okay. Don't worry. Doing nothing is not bad. Ipso facto.

          LARRY
          Sure.

          

          

          

          

          104

          CLASSROOM
          We are close over LARRY's shoulder as he scribbles symbols onto
          the chalkboard.

          LARRY
          . and that means... so that... from which we derive...
          His glances back toward the class show that he is wearier, baggier-eyed,
          more haggard
          than ever. There is also something odd about his posture.
          He writes smaller and smaller so as to finish before hitting
          the right edge of the
          chalkboard.
          . and also.. which lets us... and...
          Wider as he finishes and straightens up, revealing that he has
          been stooping to write
          across the very bottom of the board.
          The equation covers every inch of the classroom-wide three-paneled
          chalkboard. LARRY
          is an off balance figure at the right edge of frame.
          Reverse on the class: staring.
          Okay?
          LARRY claps chalk dust from his hands.
          . The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever
          really know... what's going on.
          A bell sounds. The students start to shake off their stupor and
          rise. LARRY projects over
          the wallah:
          . So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure
          anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on
          the mid-term.
          The thinning crowd gradually reveals one person still seated:
          Sy Ableman.
          He wears a prayer shawl and yarmulka.

          

          

          

          

          105
          LARRY does not seem surprised to see him.
          . Did you follow that?
          Sy Ableman
          Of coss. Except that I know what's going on. How do you
          explain.

          LARRY
          Well, it might be that, in, you know, in L'olam ha-bah-
          Sy Ableman
          Excuse me. Not the issue. In this world, LARRY.
          He nods at the chalkboard.
          . I'll concede that it's subtle. It's clevva. But at the end
          of the day, is it convincing?

          LARRY
          Well-yes it's convincing. It's a proof. It's mathematics.
          Sy Ableman
          Excuse me, LARRY. Mathematics. Is the art of the possible.
          LARRY's brow furrows.

          LARRY
          I don't think so. The art of the possible, that's... I can't
          remember... something else...
          Sy Ableman
          I'm a serious man, LARRY.

          LARRY
          I know that. So if I've got it wrong, what do I-
          Sy Ableman holds up one hand to silence him.
          Sy Ableman
          So simple, LARRY. See Minda.

          

          

          

          

          106

          LARRY
          I know, I want to see Minda! I want to see Minda! They
          told me that oonh!
          Without our having seen him rise or cross the room Sy Ableman
          has body-slammed
          LARRY into the chalkboard. Now he grabs LARRY by the hair and
          whips his head against
          the equation. As he slams LARRY's head, again and again, the
          chalkboard chatters and the
          fringes on Sy's tallis dance.
          Sy Ableman
          See Minda! See Minda! I fucked your wife, LARRY! I
          seriously fucked her! That's what's going on! See Minda!

          LARRY
          Very close on his eyes as they open. His head is on a pillow.
          Dull early light. A hissing
          sound.
          LARRY looks blearily over.
          On the vanity table just outside the motel bathroom door sits
          Uncle Arthur's cyst
          evacuator. Its waggling hose snakes into the cracked bathroom
          door as the machine
          hisses.

          MEZUZA
          On a doorpost.
          A hand enters to knock. A long beat. The person knocking gives
          up and his footsteps
          start to go away just as the door opens to reveal an attractive
          woman the sunbathing
          neighbor, now wearing plaid shorts and a buttoned white blouse.
          Her point-of-view: LARRY, frozen halfway down the stoop, head
          turned back up toward
          the door.

          WOMAN
          Mr. Gopnik.

          

          

          

          

          107

          LARRY
          Oh. Hello, Mrs. Samsky. I knocked, and then thought you
          weren't here. I, uh...
          Mrs. Samsky's voice is soft and breathy:
          Mrs. Samsky
          It just took me a second to get to the door. I was out back.
          LARRY stands nodding.
          He seems to need prompting. Mrs. Samsky does:
          . Can I help you? Wanna come in?

          LARRY
          No, I-
          One hand on the door, she steps back.
          Mrs. Samsky
          It's cooler.

          LARRY
          Oh. Okay. I just wanted to let you know...
          He is entering.

          INSIDE
          After the outside glare the house does indeed seem cooler. LARRY
          looks around the living
          room, dim but neat. Wavering light sifts through closed vertical
          blinds which drift and
          click over floor-vented air-conditioning.
          Mrs. Samsky closes the door, shutting out all sound from outside.

          LARRY
          I've noticed that Mr. Samsky isn't around, and I-
          Mrs. Samsky
          He travels.

          

          

          

          

          108

          LARRY
          Uh-huh. Yeah, I never seem to see him, so I thought I
          should let you know, since you're somewhat new here, if
          you ever have, whatever, chores that you'd, um, or just help
          with something-I've decided to help others-you know,
          in a neighborly way...
          She gazes at him with the least hint of a smile and waits for
          the speech to dribble away to
          silence. In the ensuing beat, quiet except for the clicking of
          the blinds, she is perfectly
          still. Finally, only her mouth moves:
          Mrs. Samsky
          How thoughtful.
          LARRY shrugs off the compliment.

          LARRY
          Oh it's nothing. It's just good to know your neighbors.
          And to help. Help others. Although I don't care much for
          my neighbors on the other side, I must say.
          Mrs. Samsky lets another smiling silence pass before responding.
          Mrs. Samsky
          . Goys, aren't they?

          LARRY
          Mm. Very much so. Maybe it's not fair to judge; I have to
          admit I-
          Mrs. Samsky
          Won't you sit down?

          LARRY
          Oh! Um. Okay. Thank you.
          Mrs. Samsky
          Iced tea? I have some.
          She is already turning to the kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          109

          LARRY
          Okay.. .
          He watches her and reacts to:
          The backs of her thighs. The flesh retains the broad cross-hatch
          of her lawn chair.
          She disappears into the kitchen, but calls out:
          Mrs. Samsky
          I don't see you around much, either.

          LARRY
          Yes. Actually I haven't been home a lot recently, I, uh, my
          wife and I are, uh, well, she's got me staying at the Jolly
          Roger, the little motel there on-
          Mrs. Samsky is reentering with two tall glasses of iced tea beaded
          with moisture. The
          click of the ice cubes joins the clicking of the blinds.
          Mrs. Samsky
          You're in the doghouse, huh?
          She hands him a glass as she sits on the couch next to him, not
          invasively close, one bare
          leg folded onto the couch, the other draped over it.

          LARRY
          Yeah, that's an understatement I guess, I -thank you-I,

          UH-
          Mrs. Samsky
          Do you take advantage of the new freedoms?
          LARRY stares at her. Mrs. Samsky gazes back. Her look displays
          equanimity; his, not.

          FINALLY:

          LARRY
          . What do you mean.
          Her look holds for one more beat and then she swivels and opens
          the drawer of an end
          table.

          

          

          

          

          110
          She turns back with a joint.
          Mrs. Samsky
          It's something I do. For recreation.
          She lights it.

          LARRY
          That's... Marijuana?
          Mrs. Samsky
          Mm-hmm.
          She hands the joint over.
          . You'll find you'll need the iced tea.
          LARRY handles the bitty cigarette with trepidation.

          LARRY
          Is it. . well.. . okay...

          THE VERTICAL BLINDS
          Some minutes later. They drift and click in the air blown from
          the floor vents.
          LARRY stares at them.
          After a long beat:

          LARRY
          Maybe Rabbi Scott was right.
          Mrs. Samsky
          Who's Rabbi Scott?

          LARRY
          The junior rabbi.
          Mrs. Samsky
          The junior rabbi.

          

          

          

          

          111
          Another long beat. Neither person feels compelled to speak as
          the blinds click.
          The joint makes another trip back and forth.

          THEN:
          . What did he say?

          LARRY
          He spoke of.. perception. All my problems are just...
          just a... a mere..
          He trails off, listening.
          . Is that a siren?
          Mrs. Samsky
          No. Some people get a little paranoid when they... Holy
          cow... That is a siren.

          OUTSIDE
          The Samsky's door opens and LARRY stumbles out. He stares.
          The police car has stopped in front of his own house next door,
          lights still flashing. Two
          cops are going up the walk with Uncle Arthur between them in
          handcuffs.
          LARRY, stunned, walks woodenly toward his house.

          LARRY
          Hey!
          Neither the cops nor Uncle Arthur has heard. They have rung the
          doorbell and now
          disappear inside.
          LARRY projects louder-

          . HEY!
          -and starts to sprint. Mrs. Samsky has emerged from her house
          behind.
          LARRY takes the stoop steps two at a time. His door stands open
          and the theme from F

          

          

          

          

          112
          Troop issues from within.
          Just inside the two policeman stand with their backs to us and
          handcuffed Uncle Arthur
          in between. The three men face DANNY, who addresses them, projecting
          over the music
          from the TV.

          DANNY
          Sort of. He sleeps on the couch.

          LARRY
          This is crazy!
          This brings the cops' look around. Uncle Arthur also turns, shamefaced,
          to LARRY.

          COP
          Does this man live here?

          ARTHUR
          I didn't know what to tell them! They asked for my
          address.. .

          LARRY
          It's just mathematics! You can't arrest a man for
          mathematics!

          ARTHUR
          I didn't know whether to say I lived here or at the Jolly
          Roger.

          COP
          You know this man?

          ARTHUR
          I figured this would sound more... I don't know...
          Mrs. Samsky appears behind LARRY on the stoop.

          DANNY
          Dad, why is Uncle Arthur in handcuffs?

          LARRY
          It's all a mistake. I mean, not a mistake, a, a-

          

          

          

          

          113

          ARTHUR
          Hello, Mrs. Samsky.

          LARRY
          -a miscarriage-

          COP
          Does this man live here?

          DANNY
          He sleeps on the couch.

          LARRY
          Look! What did he do!

          ARTHUR
          Nothing! I didn't do anything!

          DANNY
          It folds out. Dad sleeps on a cot.

          LARRY
          You can't just-

          COP
          Sir, we picked this man up at the North Dakota.
          LARRY is brought up short.

          LARRY
          The North Dakota!

          ARTHUR
          But I didn't do anything!

          DANNY
          Dad, what's the North Dakota?

          COP
          Solicitation. Sodomy. Very serious.

          

          

          

          

          114

          LARRY
          . The North Dakota!
          We hold on LARRY's shocked reaction as we hear DANNY, off:

          DANNY
          What's Sodomy, Dad?

          DON MILGRAM
          He wears a black armband. He sits thinking, bouncing steepled
          fingers against his nose.

          FINALLY:

          DON
          What does Arthur say?

          LARRY
          He says he didn't do anything.

          DON
          Uh-huh.

          LARRY
          He says. . . he just went in for a drink.

          DON
          Uh-huh.
          Long beat.
          . Does Arthur drink?

          LARRY
          No.

          DON
          Uls-huh.

          LARRY
          . He says he was confused.

          

          

          

          

          115

          DON
          Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well. The North Dakota. Well. You'll
          need a criminal attorney.

          LARRY
          Okay. Who's-

          DON
          Ron Meshbesher.

          LARRY
          Is he good?

          DON
          Ron is very good.
          LARRY's gaze wanders. He becomes wistful.

          LARRY
          I don't understand. He goes to mixers at the Hillel House.

          DON
          Mm.
          A beat.
          . I would call Ron Meshbesher.

          LARRY
          Is he expensive?

          DON
          Ron is not cheap.
          Don focuses on LARRY. Cheerful change of subject:
          . DANNY's bar mitzvah is... ?

          LARRY
          This week.

          

          

          

          

          116

          DON
          This shabbas! Great!
          He nods.
          . It'll be okay. Try to relax, LARRY. Try to relax.

          MRS. SAMSKY'S BEDROOM
          LARRY is making strenuous love to Mrs. Samsky.
          Mrs. Samsky
          So good... so good...
          She rolls on top of LARRY to straddle him and, still humping,
          she lights a mentholated
          cigarette. LARRY moans.

          LARRY
          Oh my God, Mrs. Samsky...
          Beyond her head LARRY can see the low cottage-cheese ceiling
          of the bedroom. Outside
          we can hear Gar Brandt mowing the lawn.
          Suddenly we hear muffled laughter and the front door opening.
          LARRY panics. He hisses:
          . Who is it?
          Footsteps are approaching along the hall. Mrs. Samsky doesn't
          react; she looks calmly
          down at LARRY even as the bedroom door opens behind her and CLIVE
          Park walks in
          wearing a traffic mask. LARRY is mortified:
          CLIVE, please! Wait outside!
          Mrs. Samsky blows smoke into LARRY's eyes. The screen goes black.
          Close on LARRY as he opens his eyes. A shadow falls across his
          face.
          His point-of-view: a wooden plank is just being slid into place
          over his head. The bang
          of hammer on nailhead. In the black:

          

          

          

          

          117
          Sy Ableman's Voice
          Nailing it down is so impawtant.
          We hear the chanting of Kaddish and the sound of dirt hitting
          the top of the coffin. It
          drums a steady rhythm. Grace Slick's voice enters: "Somebody
          to Love." In a break in
          the vocals right before the chorus:
          Mrs. Samsky's Voice
          It's something we do. For recreation.
          On the chorus downbeat, a crescent moon pops into the black.
          Gar Brandt traverses the
          sky, pushing his lawn mower. A cow flies the opposite way. Stars
          twinkle. Sy Able-
          man walks across the sky dressed like a shtetl elder, a bindlestick
          over one shoulder.
          LARRY bolts upright in bed.
          Sudden quiet.
          Uncle Arthur is snoring in the tatty motel room's other bed.
          A title burns in:

          MINDA

          LARRY
          He stands looking down in low shot. Above him is cheap Johnson-Armstrong
          dropped
          ceiling.

          LARRY
          Please. I need help. I've already talked to the other rabbis.
          Please.
          Reverse shows an elderly eastern European woman seated behind
          a desk, looking up at

          LARRY.
          . I won't take much of his time. I need help. I need
          Minda. It's not about DANNY's bar mitzvah. My boy
          DANNY. This coming shabbas. Very joyous event. That's
          all fine. It's, it's more about myself, I've... I've had quite
          a bit of tsuris lately. Marital problems. Professional. You
          name it. This is not a frivolous request. This is a serious-
          I'm a serious-I'm, uh, I've tried to be a serious man. You

          

          

          

          

          118
          know, tried to do right, be a member of the community,
          raise the, raise the, DANNY, SARAH, they both go to school,
          Hebrew school, a good breakfast. Well, DANNY goes to
          Hebrew school, SARAH doesn't have time, she mostly...
          washes her hair. Apparently there are several steps
          involved. But you don't have to tell Minda that. Just tell
          him I need help. Please. I need help.
          He lapses into silence, staring at the secretary.
          She stares inscrutably back.
          After a moment she rises, goes to the door behind her, opens
          it, shuffles into the dimness
          of an inner office.
          LARRY cranes to see past her. Her own body and the dimness interfere
          with a good view
          of the figure hunched behind the desk. The man is old and bent.
          His desktop is empty.
          Murmured voices in Hebrew.
          A clock ticks in the outer office. LARRY looks around, waiting.
          Mysterious Judaica adorns the outer office.
          The old woman is shuffling back. She closes the door on the motionless
          rabbi and sits
          down, heavily, behind her own desk.

          SECRETARY
          The rabbi is busy.

          LARRY
          He didn't look busy!
          As she starts shuffling papers:

          SECRETARY
          He's thinking.

          NIGHT
          Sidor Belarsky comes in at the cut.

          

          

          

          

          119
          We are booming down on LARRY, asleep in bed.
          We hear weeping, soft, suppressed.
          LARRY stirs. He opens his eyes.
          After a groggy beat he reacts to the weeping. He looks over.

          LARRY
          Arthur... ? Arthur?
          Arthur is a dim mound on the next bed. His weeping continues.
          For no reason LARRY continues to keep his voice to a whisper:
          . Arthur. What's wrong?
          No answer.
          . Arthur. It'll be okay. Arthur. We'll get Ron
          Meshbesher. It'll be okay-

          ARTHUR

          AAAHHHH!
          Shockingy loud, the scream is hard to interpret.
          Arthur flings off his bedclothes. He leaps from the bed and runs
          to the door. In boxer
          shorts and undershirt he flings the door open and runs out of
          the room.

          LARRY
          Arthur!
          LARRY leaps from his bed, also in his underwear.
          He goes to the door but pauses, peering cautiously outside. Satisfied
          that the courtyard is
          deserted, he plunges into it.

          COURTYARD
          The courtyard/parking lot is hardlit by ghastly mercury vapor
          lights. The pool,
          surrounded by chain-link fence, has been drained. Its white concrete
          interior is cracked

          

          

          

          

          120
          and weedy.
          Uncle Arthur is hunched weeping in a corner of the pool enclosure.

          LARRY

          (HISSING)
          Arthur!
          He opens the creaking gate and scurries over to Arthur.
          . You've got to pull yourself together!
          Arthur is suddenly angry. His voice bounces off the concrete:

          ARTHUR
          It's all shit, LARRY! It's all shit!

          LARRY
          Arthur. Don't use that word.

          ARTHUR
          It's all fucking shit!

          LARRY
          Arthur! Come on!

          ARTHUR
          Look at everything Hashem has given you! And what do I
          get! I get fucking shit!

          LARRY
          Arthur. What do I have. I live at the Jolly Roger.

          ARTHUR
          You've got a family. You've got a job. Hashem hasn't
          given me bupkes.

          LARRY
          It's not fair to blame Hashem, Arthur. Please. Sometimes
          -please calm down-sometimes you have to help your-
          self.

          ARTHUR

          

          

          

          

          121
          Don't blame me! You fucker!

          LARRY
          Arthur. Please.

          ARTHUR
          Hashem hasn't given me shit. Now I can't even play cards.
          He starts weeping again.
          LARRY looks around.

          LARRY
          Arthur. This isn't the right forum. Please. Not by the
          pool.
          Arthur weeps.
          Arthur... It's okay... It's okay...

          MORNING
          LARRY and Arthur are driving. We are looking at the two of them
          square through a
          windshield in which towering conifers stream by in reflection.
          It seems to be a glorious
          day.

          LARRY
          Is this it?
          Both men peer out.

          ARTHUR
          I think so... yeah... there...
          He indicates the road ahead.

          A SIGNPOST
          The old-fashioned kind with wooden fingers pointing the different
          directions.
          One points toward CANADA.

          

          

          

          

          122
          We tip off the sign as LARRY's car passes and recedes. There
          is a canoe strapped to its
          roof.

          BOUNDARY WATERS
          Beautiful, wooded, remote.
          The car is parked at water's edge, having backed down a lane
          of two tracks worn
          through the undergrowth. LARRY and Arthur are lowering the canoe
          into water.

          LARRY
          Okay.. .
          He straightens. Arthur straightens. LARRY hugs him.
          .Look...
          They separate and LARRY pulls a white envelope from his pocket
          and gives it to Arthur.
          . This'll help you get back on your feet.
          Arthur looks into the envelope.

          ARTHUR
          Oh my God. Where did you get this?

          LARRY
          Doesn't matter. When you-

          ARTHUR
          This is a lot of money!

          LARRY
          It should get you started.

          ARTHUR
          This is a lot of money! Are you sure you don't need it?

          LARRY
          Arthur, I'm fine. Come on, get in. When you're settled...

          

          

          

          

          123
          Arthur climbs into the canoe.
          . let me know how to get in touch.
          He helps push the boat off. Arthur is twisted around, looking
          back. As he drifts off:

          ARTHUR
          Are you sure this is okay?

          LARRY
          It's fine. It's fine...
          LARRY waves.
          Arthur waves bravely back, then turns to pick up the oars. A
          couple of strokes and he
          turns back again with a last thought. He calls:

          ARTHUR
          LARRY. I'm sorry. What I said last night.

          LARRY
          I know. It's okay.
          A lingering look from Arthur, and then he turns back to row.
          A gunshot.
          Blood spurts from the back of Uncle Arthur's neck.
          He slumps forward, dead.

          VOICE
          Good shot!
          LARRY looks wildly around. He sees:
          Gar Brandt and Mitch in their camo fatigues, hard to pick out
          in the foliage. They are
          looking off toward the canoe, Mitch just lowering his rifle.
          Gar Brandt's look swings around, into the lens. He points at
          us:
          There's another Jew, son.

          

          

          

          

          124
          Mitch swings his rifle toward us.
          He fires.

          LARRY
          Gasping awake in the motel room.
          He looks around.
          It is dawn.
          Arthur sits on the edge of his bed in his underwear, staring
          off into space, slackjawed,
          vacant-eyed, drained.
          LARRY gazes around the room, waiting for things to fall into
          place.
          Finally, blearily:

          LARRY
          Were we... out at the pool last night?
          Arthur, still staring off, responds in a flat, empty voice:

          ARTHUR
          Yes. I'm sorry.
          LARRY blinks sleep away.
          After a beat:

          LARRY
          It's shabbas.
          Another beat.
          Arthur heaves a deep sigh.

          ARTHUR
          I'll go drain my cyst.

          

          

          

          

          125

          RESTROOM
          Day. A two-urinal, two-stall men's room of old tile and yellowed
          fixtures.
          We are low. One of the stall doors is closed. Under it we see
          the dress shoes and dress
          pants of two young men standing inside.
          We hear a long sucking inhale.
          Ronnie Nudell's Voice
          Gimme that fucker.
          A loudly projected echoing male voice:

          VOICE
          Ya'amod hab'rayshit.

          SANCTUARY
          DANNY, seated in the second pew next to his parents and sister
          and Uncle Arthur, rises
          and shuffles along the row to the aisle. His eyes are wide and
          red-rimmed.
          The prelapped voice was his call to the torah. All eyes in the
          congregation, which fills
          the large sanctuary, are on him.
          In great echoing silence he walks to the steps on the right side
          of the bema and climbs.
          The right-side lectern is surrounded by a gaggle of old Jewish
          men. They busy
          themselves with the preparation of the pair of scrolls on the
          lectern, rolling them,
          pausing, rolling some more, muttering prayers, kissing the scrolls
          by means of their
          tsitsim. They pay DANNY no attention.
          DANNY takes his place centered behind the lectern. His chin comes
          up to the bottom of
          the reading platform.
          Men continue to mutter prayers around him. A pair of hands appear
          on his shoulders
          from behind. DANNY looks down at the strange hands. They pull
          him back.
          A foot drags a small riser out from under the lectern.
          Hands push DANNY up onto the riser.

          

          

          

          

          126
          Booming up on the torah scrolls, still being busily rolled.
          Beyond it, a sea of faces.
          The yad-a molded tin pointer-is thrust into DANNY's hand. The
          non-pointing end has
          a red silken tassel.
          DANNY looks at the bouncing tassel. He looks at the little pointing
          finger which is the
          business end of the yad.
          Men mutter around him, each a different prayer. They dip and
          doven.
          DANNY watches himself point the yad down at the scroll.
          The scroll is a dense swarm of Hebrew letters. DANNY squints.
          One voice separates from the murmurs around him. It chants, insistently,
          in a sotto-voce

          FALSETTO:

          VOICE
          Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...
          DANNY is still staring at the end of the yad against the parchment
          scroll.
          Someone's hand enters and moves the yad to a different place
          in the text.
          The voice repeats:
          . Nefesh echad sheichayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...
          DANNY looks up from the scrolls.
          In the congregation Ronnie Nudell sits hunched-shouldered and
          squished between his
          parents. He returns DANNY's red-rimmed slack-jawed stare.
          The insistent voice:
          . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot...
          DANNY looks over.
          From the surrounding scrum the prompter nods at him. He looks
          somewhat like Cantor
          Youssele Rosenblatt.

          

          

          

          

          127
          . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot.. .
          DANNY looks back down at the scroll. A hand enters to tap a pointing
          finger where the
          yad points.
          . Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effa-
          DANNY suddenly erupts:

          DANNY
          Nefesh echad shelchayim, yitzeh gamor shel effashot. .

          PROMPTER
          Mm-hm.
          DANNY continues to boom out the torah portion. He moves the yad
          along the line of
          letters.
          In the congregation, LARRY and Judith watch. We hear DANNY chanting
          fluently and
          LARRY squeezes the hand Judith has laced through his arm.
          Juith whispers:

          JUDITH
          I'm sorry that... things have been so hard for us...

          LARRY
          It's okay.

          JUDITH
          Sy had so much respect for you, LARRY.
          He pats her hand.
          A beat.
          . He wrote letters to the tenure committee.

          LATER
          The congregation is loudly singing V'Zos Hatorah. A tallised
          man of late middle age

          

          

          

          

          128
          hoists the open scroll from the lectern and raises it high, turning
          his back on the
          congregation so that all may see it.
          DANNY has been ensconced in a highbacked chair upstage on the
          bema.
          His point-of-view of the man holding the torah is close and steeply
          raked. The man is
          sweating. The heavy scrolls vibrate slightly from his effort
          to keep them aloft. As the
          congregation continues to sing he mutters under his breath:

          MAN
          Jesus Christ.. .

          LATER
          DANNY stands behind the left lectern facing Rabbi Nachtner who
          holds a small kiddush
          cup out to him.
          Although Rabbi Nachtner seems to be addressing DANNY, he is projecting
          loudly.

          NACHTNER
          . taking your place as a member of our tribe. You will
          go and see Rabbi Minda after the service. You will cele-
          brate in a reception downstairs in Schanfield Hall. And
          then you will be a member of B'Nai Abraham and of the
          Nation of Israel. DANNY Gopnik, the Sisterhood makes a
          gift to you of this kiddush cup so that you will remember
          this blessed day on the next shabbas and the next, and on
          every shabbas of a long and fruitful life, and, until that
          wonderful day when you stand under the chupa, we say.. .

          CONGREGATION
          Amen.
          DANNY, still red-eyed, tries to focus.
          His point-of-view shows the kiddush cup large in the foreground,
          extended toward him
          by the Rabbi beaming above.
          His own hand rises into frame to grasp the kiddush cup.
          The congregation starts Adon Olam.

          

          

          

          

          129

          A DOOR
          Creaking open. The cut has snapped off the robust Adon Olam,
          leaving sepulchral quiet.
          DANNY, clutching his kiddush cup, hesitantly enters the dim study.
          Minda's elderly
          eastern European gatekeeper closes the door behind him.
          Minda is an old man staring at him from behind a bare desktop.
          His look, eyes
          magnified by thick glasses, is impossible to read.
          DANNY creeps to the chair facing the desk. He gingerly sits on
          the squeaking leather
          upholstery, self-conscious under Minda's stare.
          Minda breathes regularly through his mouth. It is the only sound
          in the room.
          A long beat. The two sit face to face.
          Minda smacks his lips a couple of times, preparing to speak.
          Another beat.

          FINALLY:

          MINDA
          When the truth is found. To be lies.
          He pauses. He clears his throat.
          At length:
          . And all the hope. Within you dies.
          Another beat. DANNY waits. Minda stares.
          He smacks his lips again.
          . Then what?
          DANNY doesn't answer. It is unclear whether the question was
          directed at him.
          Quiet.

          

          

          

          

          130
          Minda clears his throat with a loud and thorough hawking.
          The hawking abates. Minda sniffs.
          . Grace Slick. Marty Balin. Paul Kanta. Jorma...
          somethin. These are the membas of the Airplane.
          He nods a couple of times.
          . Interesting.
          He reaches up and slowly opens his desk drawer. He takes something
          out. He lays it on
          the bare desk and pushes it partway across.
          . Here.
          It is DANNY's radio.
          . Be a good boy.

          LARRY'S OFFICE
          LARRY is at his desk sorting through mail.
          Arlen Finkle (off
          DANNY was magnificent.
          LARRY looks up: Arlen is leaning in his accustomed spot in the
          office doorway.

          LARRY
          Oh. Thank you, Arlen.
          Arlen Finkle
          Mazel tov. It was wonderful.

          LARRY
          Yes it was. Thank you.
          Arlen Finkle
          Such a time of nachas, LARRY. He's your youngest. You
          have to savor it.

          

          

          

          

          131

          LARRY
          I do. I will.
          Arlen Finkle
          See you at the staff caf.

          LARRY
          Yes.
          Arlen shoves off to go, but hesitates.
          Arlen Finkle
          I just... I shouldn't tell you. I'm not telling you officially.
          The tenure candidates aren't notified til Monday.

          LARRY
          . Yes?
          Arlen nods.
          Arlen Finkle
          You'll be very pleased.
          LARRY stares at him.

          LARRY
          Thank you, Arlen.
          Over his back as he goes:
          Arlen Finkle
          I didn't say anything. Mazel tov.

          HEBREW SCHOOL CORRIDOR
          Distant thunder at the cut.
          We are tracking behind Minda's female Caliban as she walks down
          the hall, stooped and
          shuffling. She holds a stack of papers in one hand.

          Mail in front of him.
          He opens an envelope from RONALD MESHBESHER, ESQ.
          In it are two pieces of paper. Topmost is a letter headed RETAINER
          AGREEMENT.
          Underneath is an invoice. The amount: $3,000.
          Arriving rain begins to patter at the window.

          HEBREW SCHOOL CLASS
          The TEACHER, Mar King, leads the class in drill.
          DANNY has a book tilted towards him on his desktop. It hides
          his radio.
          The door opens and the elderly woman shuffles to Mar King's desk.
          She hands him a
          paper from off her stack of copies.
          Mar King puts on reading glasses and inspects it. As he reads
          thunder crashes, closer.

          LARRY'S OFFICE
          He fingers the invoice.
          Close on a printed detail: PAYABLE: and, typed underneath: Upon
          Receipt.
          Wind is whipping rain hard against the window.

          HEBREW SCHOOL CLASS
          Mar King taps on the desktop for attention.
          Mar King
          Chaverim, there's a tornado warning from the weather
          service. Rabbi Minda has decided to move us over to the
          basement of the shul.
          Hubbub in the classrooom.

          

          

          

          

          133
          . Shechet. Shechet. We're gonna form two lines. This is
          orderly. Hakol b'seder.

          LARRY'S OFFICE
          He is staring down at his desktop.
          Thunder.
          He reaches up and scratches his nose as he stares at his desk.
          On the desk: a ledger sheet with a list of students' names. Next
          to each name, a grade.
          LARRY drums his fingers.
          He picks up a pencil.
          He goes down to PARK, CLIVE. Next to it is an F.
          He waggles the pencil, eraser-end thumping the sheet.
          He erases the F. He enters a C.
          The pencil leaves frame. We hold for a beat on the new grade.
          The hand reenters. It puts a minus sign after the C.
          The hand withdraws.
          LARRY closes the file. Just as he does so:
          The phone jangles, very harsh.
          LARRY looks at it, frozen.
          He lets it ring a couple times.
          He reaches for it. He slowly picks it up.

          Hi, Len Shapiro.

          Oh. Hello Dr. Shapiro.
          Dr. Shapiro
          Listen, mazel tov on DANNY.

          LARRY
          Yes, thank you.
          Dr. Shapiro
          Listen, could you come in to discuss these X-ray results?
          LARRY sits frozen, phone to his ear.

          Yes?
          Dr. Shapiro
          LARRY, could you come in and discuss these X-ray results?

          A beat.

          LARRY
          When?
          Dr. Shapiro
          Now. Now is good. I've cleared some time now.

          TALMUD TORAH PARKING LOT
          The students mill about. It is overcast dark, and extremely windy.
          Someone is fumbling with keys at the shul.
          DANNY still has his radio with the earpiece in.
          Everyone's clothing flaps.
          Ronnie Nudell shouts above the wind:
          Ronnie Nudell
          That fucking flag is gonna rip right off the flagpole!

          CAR
          We are looking through a windshield lashed by rain at LARRY,
          driving. His hands are
          clenched tight on the wheel. Wipers pump to keep up with the
          rain. The cars behind
          have their lights on. It has gotten quite dark.
          Passing streetlights rhythmically sweep LARRY's face, their light
          stippled and bent by the
          rain on the windows.

          TALMUD TORAH PARKING LOT
          DANNY is looking across the lot in which orange school busses
          are parked. His head bobs
          in time to the music. His hair whips in the wind. A building
          roar, very deep.

          

          

          

          

          136
          We hear, very compressed, the beginning of "Somebody to Love."
          DANNY sees a shaggy-haired youth among the milling students.

          DANNY
          Hey! Fagle!
          From behind DANNY, over his shoulder: we see a funnel cloud in
          the middle distance.
          A growing rumble. The tornado is approaching.
          At the first downbeat of its chorus the Jefferson Airplane song
          bumps up full.

          We cut to black, and credits.

 ACE VENTURA PET DETECTIVE Written by Jack Bernstein Tom Shadyac Jim Carrey EXT. STREET - DAY A UPS Man with a big pot belly is walking down the street, whistling and carelessly tossing a package in the air. We hear the sound of broken glass in the box. He passes a professional woman. UPS MAN Good morning, UPS! He tosses the box behind his back like a basketball, then acknowledges another passerby. UPS MAN UPS, good to see you! He takes a couple of steps, then flings the package incredibly high into the air, spins completely around and expertly drops to one knee and catches the box. A Hispanic man passes. UPS MAN Buenos dias. Uo Pay eSsay. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY The UPS Man dodges a couple of black kids as though playing basketball. He runs up the front steps of the building. He reaches out to open the front door and inadvertently flings the package behind him and back down the steps. He goes back, retrieves the package, then enters the building. INT. LOBBY - DAY Several people stand in the elevator. The UPS Man just makes it, but the door closes on the package... REPEATEDLY. He feigns embarrassment. INT. 3RD FLOOR - DAY ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN. The UPS Man throws the package out onto the floor and starts kicking it down the hall like a soccer player. With one last big kick the parcel lands in front of APARTMENT 3B. He picks it up and knocks on the door. We hear a small dog barking. GRUFF MAN (O.S.) Shut the hell up, you stupid mutt! An angry, burly man pokes his nose hairs out the chained door. GRUFF MAN What do you want? UPS MAN UPS, sir. And how are you this afternoon? Alrighty then! The man grumpily unchains the door. He's a big guy - 6'5", 250, and 50 of that is chest hair. A small Shiatsu stands beside him. UPS MAN I have a package for you. The UPS guy thrusts the package toward the man. We can clearly hear broken glass inside. The man takes the package. GRUFF MAN It sounds broken. UPS MAN Most likely sir! I bet it was something nice though! Now... I haver an insurance form. If you'll just sign here, here, and here, and initial here, and print your name here, we'll get the rest of the forms out to you as soon as we can. The man begrudgingly begins to fill out the form. The dog wags his tail and whines. We can see that he likes the UPS guy. UPS MAN That's a lovely dog you have. Do you mind if I pet him, sir? GRUFF MAN (mumbles) I don't give a rat's ass. The UPS Man bends down and talks to the dog in a really sucky pet talk. UPS MAN Oo ja boo ba da boo boo do booo! GRUFF MAN (under breath) Brother. Before the Gruff Man can finish, the UPS Man stands back up and takes the form again. UPS MAN That's fine sir. I can fill out the rest. You just have yourself a good day. Take care, now! 'Bye 'bye, then! THRASH MUSIC STARTS INT. HALLWAY -- CONT'D The UPS Man moves swiftly down the hall and into the stair well. INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D The Gruff Man shakes the box, tosses it down and sits in front of the TV. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CONT'D The UPS Man bursts from the front door and hustles down the street very quickly. He passes several people. UPS MAN (quickly) UPS, S'cuse me. UPS, comin' through. INT. APARTMENT 3B - CONT'D We see the back of the Shiatsu staring at the crack in the front door. He has not moved an inch. The Gruff Man looks over. GRUFF MAN Hey, stupid! Get away from the door! The dog doesn't budge and this really pisses him off. He gets up and heads for the dog. GRUFF MAN What's the matter with you, I said GIT!!! He roughly picks the dog up by the scruff of the neck, but as he turns it around we see that it is a stuffed dog. Around it's neck is a business card that reads, "You have been had by Ace Ventura - Pet Detective." He breathes fire. GRUFF MAN Son of a bitch! He smashes the dog to the ground. EXT. ALLEY - CONT'D As the UPS Man/Ace rounds the corner, his shirt opens up at his pot belly and the Shiatsu's head sticks out. Ace is gloating. ACE (announcer's voice) That was a close one, ladies and gentlemen. Unfortunately, in every contest, there must be... A LOOSER! He jumps into an old beat-up Chevy Bel Air, and lets the dog out onto the passenger seat. ACE (CONT'D) LOOOHOOOSERRRHERRR! He then pulls open the car's ashtray, and to the dog's delight, it's filled with puppy chow. He tries to start the engine but it won't turn over. The dog shoots him a look. ACE (to dog) No problem, it gets flooded. We'll just wait a few seconds. Ace sits back. SMASH!!! From Ace's POV we see a Baseball bat shatter the front windshield. ACE Or, we could try it now. Ace frantically tries to start the car. His new friend continues around the car beating the living shit out of it. ACE Oooh, boy. ACE'S POV We see the creep wailing on the car in Ace's side view mirror. ACE Warning! Assholes are closer than they appear! The dog is barking insanely. ACE (to dog) You think you can do better?! The baseball bat is now pummeling the trunk. ACE Wanna give me a push while you're back there? BOOM! The back window shatters. Then the car's engine roars to life. Ace rejoices. ACE FARFEGNUGENNNNN!!! Ace leaves the bad guy in a cloud of dust and gravel, screaming bloody murder. EXT. MIAMI CITY STREETS - DAY Ace and his new pal speed away freely. Close on the happy dog, hanging his head out the car window. PAN across the broken windshield to Ace, also hanging his head out the window to see where he's going. The car drives by a sign on a telephone pole: "Reward" -- with a picture of the Shiatsu in Ace's seat. THRASH MUSIC ENDS INT. HOUSE - DAY A very sexy woman is hugging and kissing the Shiatsu. WOMAN My little baby. You missed mommy didn't you? Did daddy hurt you? I won't let him, no I won't. He may have kept the big screen TV, but he's not gonna keep my baby. No he isn't. (very sexy to Ace) Thank you, Mr. Ventura. How can I ever repay you? She slinks over to Ace and puts her arms around his neck. ACE Well, the reward would be good, and there was some damage to my  She cuts Ace off with a devastating kiss. WOMAN Would you like me to take you pants off instead? ACE Ummmm Sure. She pulls him toward the bedroom. WOMAN It takes a big man to stand up to my husband. He's already put two of my lovers in the hospital. ACE How did he find out? Does he have you followed. WOMAN No I tell him She plants a kiss on Ace's neck and pulls him down out of frame onto the bed. EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - DAY The stands are empty, but there's plenty happening on the field. The Miami Dolphins are practicing. Dan Marino is in top form, hitting pass after pass. Behind one of the goal posts, the team's mascot, a rare dolphin (SNOWFLAKE), wearing #4, is practicing his routine. The Trainer is dressed like a quarterback. TRAINER Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut! Snowflake swims over, snatches a small football out of the Trainer's hand, and does an end zone dance on his tail. He then returns the ball to the trainer. The Trainer now sets the ball on the dolphin's tail and snowflake "kicks" a perfect field goal. The Trainer blows a whistle and raises both arms. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. DOLPHIN STADIUM PLAYING FIELD - NIGHT The stadium is now completely empty. Snowflake peacefully swims around his tank. Suddenly, the water is illuminated by the headlights of an n.d. panel truck. The rear door slides open. Two men jump out in wet suits. They slip into the water while a third waits outside the tank. Snowflake surfaces to check out the action. One of the men holds out a fish. Snowflake eagerly takes it, then shudders as a large syringe is stuck into his back. Snowflake thrashes around. Quick cut of a hand with the blur of a ring slamming against the tank. But the needle has done its job. Snowflake quickly goes limp. Snowflake is loaded into the back of the truck. Move in on Snowflake's face. His excited cackle has turned into a painful whimper. The truck skids away passing the guard gate. The guard is hog tied and gagged, struggling to free himself. INT. ADELLE'S FRIENDLY PET SHOP - NEXT DAY Close up on a dead goldfish laying on a newspaper. We pull back to reveal ADELLE ROSENBERG, the seventy year old owner of a cluttered pet shop. She's handing a live goldfish in a bag to JENNIFER, a very sweet nine year old. ADELLE Here you go, honey. Now remember this kind of fish doesn't like it in the freezer. JENNY But what's gonna happen to Dolly? ADELLE Don't worry, I'll make sure she gets a proper burial. Jennifer exits. Adelle calls to her cat, and tosses it the goldfish. The cat catches it in mid-air. ADELLE Rest in peace. Ace enters the pet shop. It looks like he slept in his clothes. ADELLE Well here comes another dead fish. ACE Hi, beautiful. What time do you get off? ADELLE Uh oh. ACE (suggestively) I've heard some pretty great things about your kibble. ADELLE Well, I hope I'm not getting a reputation. ACE (switching to mock anger) Just get me the food! She chuckles at Ace as she loads a couple of bags with different kinds of pet food. ADELLE So ahh, when can I expect you to pay your tab? ACE I'm a little bit Sli Pickins, right now, I'm a little Tight Squeeze Louise, a little Welfare Wolly, Potless Pissing Pete, I'm ah  ADELLE If you were a horse I'd shoot ya'. Just take it. ACE Gravy! I'm good for it, Adelle. I'm on a very big case right now. Ace reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a flyer with a picture of a white pigeon. ACE See this pigeon? It's a true albino. Some rich guy lost it. He's offering a ten thousand dollar reward. ADELLE Wow, albino pigeons are very rare. How are you going to find him? ACE Just keep my eyes open, and hope to god it doesn't snow. Ace grabs his bags and heads for the door. ADELLE You're a good boy, Ace. A good boy. He holds the door open for an elderly gentleman who is entering at the same time. The gentleman is walking a toy poodle on a leash. The poodle is dragging its butt along the entire length of the floor. Ace and Adelle just stare. ELDERLY MAN (in a loud voice) Do you have anything for ringworm? EXT. SURFSIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY Ace enters the courtyard of a two story U-shaped apartment complex carrying his groceries. It's a crappy joint but he calls it home. Inside an open apartment on the ground floor, the landlord, MR. SHICKADANCE, sits watching TV, stuffing his face with cheese doodles. Ace sneaks past the door and up the stairs. EXT. SECOND FLOOR - DAY Ace is just putting the key in the door when the landlord steps up behind him. Ace is startled by the dreaded 'Shickadance Rasp' (not unlike Linda Blair in THE EXORCIST). LANDLORD Venturaaaaa? Ace straightens up, but doesn't turn around. ACE Yes, Satan? Now Ace turns around in mock surprise. ACE Oh, I'm sorry, sir. You sounded like someone else. LANDLORD Never mind the wise cracks Venturaaa. You owe me rent! ACE Mr. Shickadance I told you, you're my first priority! As soon as I find the white pigeon, you're paid!! LANDLORD I heard animals in there Ventura! I heard 'em again this morning, scratchin' around. ACE I never bring my work home with me, sir. The landlord notices the bags of kibble. LANDLORD Oh, yeah? What's all this pet food for? ACE (beat) Fiber. The landlord isn't buying it. ACE You wanna take a look for yourself? Go head. Ace rattles his keys in the door. Then he swings it open and turns on the light. The house is clear. Ace walks in as the landlord stands there snooping and sniffing the air. ACE Well are you satisfied? LANDLORD (still suspicious) Yeah, but don't ever let me catch you with an animal in there, that's all! ACE Okay then. Take care now. 'Bye 'bye. The landlord walks away as Ace closes the door. ACE (quietly to himself) LLOOSER. He then turns to the room and gives a distinct whistle. CHAOS ENSUES! Animals jump out from every direction. Lizards crawl out of drawers, birds fly through the air, all of them gravitating to Ace. ACE (to his flock) Ooshhooboobooboodoodoo! INT. MIAMI DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - LATER THAT DAY The very imposing office of BOBBY RIDDLE, owner of the Miami Dolphins. Riddle, 70, is a take charge, doesn't take crap from anyone type of guy. He is yelling at ROGER PODACTER, an ex-linebacker in his early sixties, and MELISSA ROBINSON, Podacter's attractive assistant. RIDDLE I just want to know one thing; How the hell do you lose a 500 pound fish?! Melissa's about to speak but hesitates. RIDDLE (CONT.) What? MELISSA It's not a fish, sir. It's a mammal. An angry Riddle stands up. RIDDLE Oh, thank you very much, Mrs. Jacque Cousteau! PODACTER Bob, she didn't mean anything by it. RIDDLE calms down a little, and sits. RIDDLE (calmer) Listen, personally, I don't give a good god damn about a fish. He looks at Melissa. She doesn't dare say anything. RIDDLE (CONT.) All I care about is winning this Super Bowl! I want the players' head in the right place. Shit, Roger, you've been in this game long enough, you know how superstitious players are. Our quarterback's been putting his socks on backwards since high school. And I got a lineman who hasn't washed his jock in two years because he thinks flies are lucky! I want that god damn fish on the field Super Bowl Sunday! FIND THE FISH, OR FIND NEW JOBS! INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION An upset Podacter and Melissa walk through the hallway. PODACTER Why did it have to happen now? I got three stinking years left till retirement. MELISSA I've got forty. PODACTER I'll tell you who did it. It was those goddamn animal rights nuts! Always out there with their goddamn signs, ANIMALS WERE BORN FREE, STOP TORTURING SNOWFLAKE! That goddamn fish lives better than they do! They stop outside Melissa's office by her secretary's desk. MELISSA The police are checking into the animal rights people. (to secretary) Martha, have the police called back about the dolphin yet? MARTHA No, but I wanted to tell you, when I lost my Cuddles, I hired a pet detective. PODACTER A what? MARTHA A pet detective. MELISSA Thanks Martha, but we'd better leave this to professionals. MARTHA Well actually, he was quite good. Pet detection is a very involved, highly scientific process. CUT TO: EXT. ROOF OF HOUSE - SAME TIME CLOSE ON ACE - COOING like a pigeon. Widen to reveal, Ace precariously perched on the roof of a two story building. He is four feet away from "The" pigeon. Ater a beat, he makes a mad, spastic, yet scientific, lunge for the bird. ACE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! The bird makes a clean getaway. Unable to stop his momentum, Ace flies past the edge of the building and slides down the side of the roof. EXT. GROUND - CONTINUOUS ACTION BAM!!! Ace crashes to the ground. As he lies face down, in a heap of trash, his beeper goes off. EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS/BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY Parking lot. Ace's clunker drives by some real nice cars. Employees stare at him. INT. SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY A stern guard is admitting people into the stadium. He scans each one with a security detection wand. MAN #1 Art Wheeler. Sporting supplies. The guard scans him. He goes. MAN #2 Tom Anderson. Concessions. The guard scans him. He goes. ACE Ace Ventura. Pet detective. The guard stares at Ace, accusingly. INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY Martha enters. MARTHA Ah Mr. Ventura to see you. MELISSA Okay, send him in. Martha exits, Ace enters. MELISSA (CONT'D) Hi, I'm Melissa Robinson. Did you have any trouble getting in? ACE No, the guy with the rubber glove was surprisingly gentle. MELISSA (apologetically) Super Bowl week. Security's tight. Mr. Ventura, I'll get right to the point She slips a tape in the VCR and gestures for Ace to sit. MELISSA Our mascot was stolen from his tank last night. Are you familiar with Snowflake? The tape shows Snowflake doing a trick. The trainer, dressed like a quarterback, shouts out signals. TRAINER (ON TAPE) Blue! 42! Blue! 42! Hut! Hut! Snowflake swims over, snatches the small football out of the trainer's hand, swims the length of the pool, does an end zone dance on his tail, then returns the ball to the trainer. MELISSA (O.S.) We got Snowflake from the Miami Seaquarium. He's a rare Bottle Nose Dolphin. That's the new trick he was going to do during the half-time show. While Ace studies the tape, he chews sunflower seeds in a bird-like fashion, placing the shells in a neat little pile on her desk. MELISSA Would you like an ashtray? ACE No, I don't smoke. He adds more shells to the pile. Melissa is already wondering if she has made a mistake. MELISSA To be honest, Mr. Ventura. I'm pretty skeptical. Before today, I didn't even know there was such a thing as a pet detective. ACE Well, now that you do, you'll know who to call if your Schnauser ever runs away. MELISSA How did you know I have a Schnauser? Ace pulls a, invisible-to-the-naked-eye dog hair off here blouse and presents it to her. ACE He's young, about five pounds, black coat, white speckles (sniffs the hair) likes to chase cars. MELISSA Very impressive. ACE You should see what I can do with a good stool sample. MELISSA I can hardly wait. Look, we've got a problem. Can you help me or not? ACE (coy) Well, sea faring creatures aren't really my expertise MELISSA We'll give you three thousand dollars on delivery. Ace immediately becomes the narrator of a nature show. ACE The dolphin is a social creature. Capable of complex communication. Traveling in large groups or schools EXT. PLAYING FIELD - A SHORT TIME LATER The Dolphin players practice. A crowd of reporters interview Marino. MARINO We just choked in 82. We had a chance to win it and we didn't. Nobody's gonna choke this time, and if they do, I'll kill 'em. Ace and Melissa head for Snowflake's tank. MELISSA The police were here this morning. Apparently, the kidnappers used the back gate. Ace bends down to look at some tire tracks on the field. MELISSA (CONT'D) They said some kind of a  ACE Four wheel drive van loaded from the rear. Ace sniffs the turf. Podacter enters nervously. MELISSA Oh, hi, Roger. How are you holding up? PODACTER Well if it looks like I'm walking funny it's because I have a bunch on reporters up my ass. They've been asking me about Snowflake all day. Who's this? MELISSA Roger Podacter, meet Ace Ventura. Ace is our pet detective. Podacter shakes his hand. PODACTER Nice to meet you. Martha Metz recommended you very highly. ACE Martha Metz? Martha Metz. Oh yeah, the bitch. PODACTER What? ACE Pekinese. Hyperactive. Lost in Highland Park area. She was half dead when I found her. Is that the tank? They both follow Ace as he makes a B-line. EXT. SNOWFLAKE'S TANK - MOMENTS LATER The tank is empty. ACE Cops drain it? MELISSA Yes. This morning. Ace hops on the ladder. ACE If I'm not back in five minutes call Lloyd Bridges. INT. DOLPHIN TANK - MOMENTS LATER While eating sunflower seeds, Ace meticulously examines the tank, including the scratches where the hand banged up against the wall when Snowflake was stolen. All the while, he is singing a bastardized version of the theme from, "Flipper." ACE Wonderful Flipper glorious Flipper magnificent Flipper The flippiest Flipper Podacter and Melissa, watching from the rim, look at each other like, "What have we gotten ourselves into?" Podacter spots something. PODACTER Oh, great. A hoard or reporters are headed their way. PODACTER (CONT) I'll try to head them off. MELISSA (to Ace) Get out of the tank. ACE (still singing) Can't hear you Flipper, Flipper Lookin' for Flipper, gotta find Flipper MELISSA I said, get out of the tank! Now! The reporters draw closer. Podacter heads them off. REPORTER So where's Snowflake? PODACTER Ah Snowflake is just, ah, not available right now. REPORTER Come on, I'm supposed to get a shot of his new trick for the evening news. REPORTER #2 What? Is he sick? Other reporters chime in. VARIOUS REPORTERS Did something happen to Snowflake?! What're you hiding..?! Melissa and Podacter don't know what to say. Then, a strange voice is heard. ACE/HEINZ (O.S.) (unrecognizable accent) How cun I be getting dis vork dun mit all da shouting? What for is dis shouting? REPORTER Who the hell is that? MELISSA That? That's ACE/HEINZ Heinz Kissvelvet. I am Trainer of Dolphins. You vant to talk to ze dolphin, you talk to me! REPORTER What happened to the regular trainer? ACE/HEINZ Vy do you care about the dolphin? Do you know him? Does he call you at home? Do you have a dorsal fin? (beat) To train ze dolphin, you must zink like ze dolphin. You must be getting oonside ze dolphin's head! Just yesterday I'm asking Snowflake "ee, eee, eee." He said, "Eee, eee, eee, eee." Und you can quote him. Ace spits at the reporters' feet. Podacter jumps in. PODACTER Gentlemen, please, Coach Shula's press conference is just about to begin. Why don't I take you over there and let, ah, Heinz, do his job. He ushers the press away. MELISSA (sotto to Ace) Are you finished, Heinz? ACE Not yet. Ace goes to the filter outside the tank, opens it, and pours out its contents  mainly leaves, small twigs and gunk. He roots through it, notices a very tiny amber stone. He smiles to himself. ACE Now I'm finished. EXT. METRO POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER THAT DAY A flurry of activity in the detective division. As Ace enters, several cops taunt him on sight, led by the obnoxious, SERGEANT AGUADO. AGUADO Hey, Ventura! Make any good collars lately? ANOTHER COP Or were they leashes? They all bust up. Aguado spots a bug on the ground. AGUADO Uh oh. (steps on the bug) Homicide, Ventura! The cops are falling all over themselves laughing. AGUADO How you gonna solve this one?! Ace walks up to them and looks at the squashed bug. ACE Good question, Aguado first I'd establish a motive. In this case the killer saw the size of the bug's dick, and became insanely jealous. The other cops all react with a big "ooooooo". Aguado has no comeback. Ace comes face to face with him. ACE Then I'd lose thirty pounds porking his wife. Aguado suddenly loses it and swings at Ace. With a lightening move, Ace sidesteps the punch and forces Aguado's face down next to the dead bug. ACE Now kiss and make up. Ace walks off. ACE (to himself) LLLOOOSER! Ace walks to the desk of EMILIO ECHAVEZ, a young energetic member of the homicide division. Ace has a silly impish look on his face. ACE (playfully) I miss you. EMILIO It's not a good time, Ace. If Einhorn sees me talking to you I'm gonna be history. ACE Okay. Just tell me what you got on Snowflake. That's all I need. EMILIO I can't say anything. My hands are tied. ACE (effeminate) Sounds like my kind of a party. A cop comes to Emilio's desk. COP Look alive, Einhorn's on her way down. EMILIO Ace, please?! ACE Just tell me who's working the case? EMILIO Aguado. ACE Aguado?! He's pimple juice! He's the poster child for lead paint chip eaters! EMILIO Look, Ace. We're a little busy with murderers and drug dealers. A missing dolphin isn't exactly a high priority. The elevator is getting closer. EMILIO Ace, gimme a break will ya? Ace nonchalantly sits back in a chair, pops a sunflower seed into his mouth and cracks it loudly. EMILIO (quickly) Okay, okay. We checked all the local animal rights groups, taxidermists, and we're running a check through DMV on all recent van rentals. So far, nada. ACE Any unusual bets being made? EMILIO Ace, it's the Super Bowl, of course there's bets being made. ACE What'd you find out about the tank? EMILIO Nothing weird. Just the tire tracks and the exit route. The guard didn't see anything. ACE That's it? EMILIO That's it. I swear. Now please go away! ACE You know something? (again impish) YOU'RE NICE! Ace gets up and exits the room. Then just as Emilio sighs with relief, Ace pops back in. ACE What about crazy Philly fans? The elevator bell rings. Out steps police LT. LOIS EINHORN, mid 30s, with a slender build, a great pair of legs and a bad tude. ACE Holy Testicle Tuesday! EINHORN (to Emilio) What the hell is he doing here? ACE I came to confess. I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll. EINHORN Spare me the routine, Ventura. I know you're working the Snowflake case. May I suggest you yield to the experts on this one? We'll find the porpoise. ACE (mock relief) Whewww now I feel better! Ace turns to go. ACE (CONT) Of course, that might not do any good. You see, nobody's missing a porpoise. It's a dolphin that's been taken. The common Harbor Porpoise has an abrupt snout, pointed teeth, and a triangular thorasic fin, while the Bottlenose Dolphin, or Tursiops Truncatus, has an elongated beak, round, cone-shaped teeth, and a distinctive serrated dorsal appendage. (beat) But I'm sure you already knew that. (beat) That's what turns me on about you. Hey maybe I'll give you a call sometime, lieutenant. Your number still 911? Alrighty then! Ace exits. CUT TO: INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT A wild thrasher club. An incredible thrash band is on stage cranking. Kids jump wildly into the moshing pit. Ace enters, sees a burnout at the bar whose head is circling insanely to the music. ACE (shouting) Excuse me?! Is Greg here?! The burnout's head thrashes on. No acknowledgement of Ace. ACE Thank you! Ace heads for the basement stairs. INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT Ace descends the stairs, stopping at a large steel door. Ace bangs on it three times. A voice is heard from inside. VOICE (O.S.) Password! ACE Tom Vu! I pay for sex! You can too! CLICK! The door electronically unlatches and slides open. INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT Ace enters. Green Peace "Save the Whales" posters abound. GREG/WOODSTOCK, a laid back, ex-hippy with long gray hair, sits at a very impressive computer set up. Ace and he have their own distinct banter. A thud from above. Ace looks up. ACE'S POV Part of the ceiling is made of metal grating, so you can see the bottom of the dance floor. A guy's face gets smashed into the grate. We see that it is the burnout from the club. ACE (to burnout) Found him! WOODSTOCK Hey! St. Francis! How's it goin? ACE Super, and thank you for asking. Hope you're having a nice day. WOODSTOCK Do you? ACE Don't I? And what are you up to? WOODSTOCK Just watching the fishies, man. There is a BLIP on the computer screen. WOODSTOCK Alright, you're just in time for the party. You see those blips? ACE I certainly do. ON THE SCREEN A map with several ships on the ocean. He quickly taps in some commands and the ships start sailing in all different directions. WOODSTOCK That's a Norwegian whaling fleet. I'm sending them new directional coordinates They'll find Jimmy Hoffa before they find any Humpbacks. ACE Gravy. Woodstock moves to a different screen. WOODSTOCK Check this out. More computer graphics come up on the screen. WOODSTOCK Just changed the formula for Purina's puppy chow. (turns to Ace) Too much filler, don't ya' think? ACE (acting turned on) I'm very attracted to you right now. Woodstock chuckles. WOODSTOCK Are you? ACE Aren't I? Can you still tap into all the aquatic supply store in the area? WOODSTOCK Of course I can. Why? ACE I want to trace the sale of any equipment for transporting or housing a dolphin within the past few months WOODSTOCK C'mon, Ace. I thought you might have a challenge for me Woodstock starts hacking away. ACE Okay then, try to remember the sixties. WOODSTOCK Wow! God one! Let's see Marine winch sling, feeder fish, 20,000 gallon tank He waits. We hear a beep. WOODSTOCK That's it. I found the culprit. ACE Who is it? WOODSTOCK (dramatically) Sea World. ACE bastard. WOODSTOCK Hang on, hang on (He taps a couple keys) Well, what do we have here? That's a lot of equipment for a civilian. The printer spits out some data. Woodstock rips off the page and hands it to Ace. ACE Ronald Camp? The billionaire? WOODSTOCK Billionaire and rare fish collector. ACE RRREHEHEALLY! A PICTURE OF CAMP Comes up on the computer screen. WOODSTOCK That, my friend, is the face of the enemy. He pages through his file on screen. WOODSTOCK Always tryin' to get his hands on endangered species Newspaper articles fill the screen. One shows a picture of Camp and some Dolphin players. ACE Hold on, this guy's connected with the Dolphins? Ace leans in. WOODSTOCK Camp donated the land the new stadium's built on. (re: article) Oh, look at this, he's throwin' another, "I'm the richest man in the universe" party. ACE (thinking) Hmmm I wonder if I can find myself a date. INT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT It's a magnificent home. There is an extremely formal party in progress. Twenty to thirty people having champagne, caviar, and hot air. We see Dan Marino sitting with an audience around him. DAN We just choked in 82. We had a chance to win and we didn't. But nobody's gonna choke this time; if they do, I'll kill 'em! Everybody laughs. EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - NIGHT Ace and Melissa climb an impressive stairway leading to Camp's mansion. MELISSA I'm really going out on a limb here, Ventura. Camp's social events are strictly A-list. ACE (a la Love Connection) 'Well, Chuck the date started off good, but just before we got to the party, she seemed to tense up.' Melissa rolls her eyes, then taps a huge door knocker. MELISSA I swear, if you do anything to embarrass me in front of Camp ACE You mean like this? Ace starts doing a spastic body convulsion. Just then a bald-headed butler, who looks a little like Gavin McCloud, opens the door. Ace doesn't notice until Melissa hits him with her purse. ACE Owwwe!!! He sees the butler. ACE Oh, hi Captain Stubing. Melissa storms in, already pissed. INT. CAMP'S MANSION - CONT Ace and Melissa enter. Camp looks over. CAMP Melissa! Glad you could make it! Oh, and who is this? MELISSA This is my date. He's a lawyer. CAMP Well, does he have a name, or should I call him "Lawyer"? MELISSA I'm sorry, it's Ace - ah, Tom Ace. Ace is very unimpressed with her lying ability. He jumps in. ACE Tom Ace. Wonderful to meet you, Mr. Camp, and congratualtions on all your success. You smell terrific. CAMP Ah, well, thank you. Please, come in. Ace boldly leads the way over to an hors 'oeuvre table. Melissa closely follows. MELISSA (sotto) This is insane. There's no way that Camp stole Snowflake. ACE (spreading pate' on a cracker) Will you just keep him occupied, while I work my magic please. She crosses the room. He puts the cracker in his mouth and begins to crunch. A man in a tux beside Ace spreads pate' on his own cracker. ACE (with a mouthful, to man) Smooshy, isn't it? Off the stuffy man's reaction INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SECONDS LATER Ace approaches Camp. ACE Excuse me, Ron, I need to use the bathroom? (palms his stomach, whispering loudly) I think it's the pate'. CAMP Um, it's just over there. ACE Thanks. Stuff probably looks better on the way out, huh? Ace laughs, slaps Camp hard on the back and heads for the bathroom. INT. BATHROOM - CONT Ace wastes no time. He locks the door, turns on the water faucet, steps onto the toilet seat, opens and climbs out a window. EXT. MANSION COURT YARD - CONT Ace drops to the ground. He follows a pathway, through a gazebo and into a doorway, all the time quietly singing the musical score to 'Mission Impossible'. INT. CAMP'S MANSION - FISH TANKS - CONT Ace browses through a myriad of dramatically lit, salt water tanks, still singing. They're all filled with colorful exotic fish. Very impressive, but nothing large enough to house a dolphin. He continues on towards a large door. INT. TANK ROOM - SECONDS LATER A huge above-ground tank is covered with curtains to discourage onlookers. Ace swings open the large door and enters. ACE Gravy. Ace climbs a ladder on the side of the tank, singing more intensely now. The ladder leads to a narrow catwalk over the center of the water. Ace grabs a feeder fish from a pail and walks carefully out there. CLOSE ON ACE. THIS IS IT. He looks into the dark pool, but sees nothing. Now he stops singing, quietly squats down and dangles the fish over the water. ACE (gently) Snowflake Here, Snowflake Snooowflaaaake A GREAT WHITE LUNGES OUT OF THE WATER AND SNAPS ITS JAWS AN INCH FROM ACE'S FACE!!! NEEDLESS TO SAY, ACE IS A TAD SURPRISED. He reels back, falling off the catwalk, into the water. INT. CAMP'S MANSION - SAME TIME Melissa is admiring some beautiful tropical fish. Camp approaches. CAMP Wonderful, aren't they? MELISSA (nervously) Yes. They're incredible. CAMP No matter what is going on in my life, I can always watch them swim and be completely at peace. INT. INDOOR POOL ROOM - SAME TIME The water is still for a moment. Then, Ace breaks the surface. ACE (frantic, to himself) It's not Snowflake It's not Snowflake. Instantly, Ace's body is thrashed around back and forth through the water, the entire length of the pool. ACE (screaming) IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAAKE!!! IT'S NOT SNOWFLAAAA!!! INT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER A line is forming outside the bathroom. Camp and Melissa are seated nearby. He's getting curious. CAMP Are you sure he's okay? It's been an awfu;;y long time. MELISSA Who, Tom? Oh, I'm sure he's fine. Ace suddenly opens the bathroom door and stands there, completely drenched from head to toe, with his pants in shreds. Everyone stops. They all stare at Ace in amazement. ACE (loudly to the entire room) DO NOT GO IN THERE! (fanning the air) Whewww!! EXT. CAMP'S MANSION - LATER Ace and Melissa are exiting. Camp stops in the doorway. CAMP (still confused) I'm very sorry, Mr. Ace. I'll have the pluming checked immediately. ACE Be sure that you do. If I had been drinking out of that toilet, I might have been killed! Ace shakes Camp's hand and notices his ring. He holds on to get a better look. It's a very distinct, commemorative ring. Camp wants his hand back but Ace won't let go. Melissa finally drags Ace away. MELISSA We'd better go. Camp looks on and shakes his head. INT. MELISSA'S CAR - NIGHT Ace is thinking. Melissa is pissed. MELISSA Y'know, I don't even want to know why your pants are missing! I don't care what happened! You could have cost me my job. ACE (on his own wavelength) I was wrong about Camp. He's breaking the law but he's not our guy. MELISSA It's a sure thing! It's definitely him! Just get me in there! Let me work my magic! Ace takes the stone out of his pocket and studies it intensely. ACE This is the key. Right here! MELISSA Hiring you was the biggest mistake I ever made! ACE So small! So unnoticeable! Yet an invaluable piece of our twisted little jigsaw puzzle! Melissa stares at Ace like he's gone crazy. There is a flash of headlights and a car horn. Melissa swerves back into her own lane. Ace drops the stone somewhere on the seat and begins to search for it frantically. ACE Damn it! (to Melissa) Try to keep it on the road. INT. MELISSA'S LIVING ROOM Melissa enters, followed by Ace. MELISSA So, you found a pebble in Snowflake's tank. Excuse me while I call CNN. ACE I found it in the filter. And it's not a pebble. It is a rare, triangular cut, orange amber. Ace hands Melissa the stone and quickly goes to one of her bookcases. MELISSA What are you talking about? ACE Tonight I saw the exact same stone in Camp's ring. Ace finds a book on the Dolphin team and flips through it. MELISSA I thought you said he didn't do it. ACE N. Camp's clean. His ring wasn't missing a stone. But whoever was in that tank had a ring just like his. MELISSA Wait a second. What ring? Ace hands her the book. It's open to a photo of ACE The 1982 Dolphin AFC Championship ring. Melissa holds the stone up to the picture. It's a perfect match. ACE I find the ring with the missing stone, I find Snowflake. MELISSA How are you gonna do that? ACE Simple. MUSIC UP CUT TO: EXT. TRACK - DAY Ace is wheezing and gasping for air as he struggles to jog up beside a large man who's running around the track at a very fast pace. When he finally catches up, he awkwardly tries to catch a glimpse of the man's ring and trips. The man just keeps going. INT. FOOTLOCKER - DAY Ace sits waiting with one shoe off. The store manager, an ex-player for the '82 team, sets down several shoe boxes. Ace checks out the ring. CLOSE ON A poster of the '82 team. The player we just saw is being crossed out. EXT. HOTEL - DAY Pan a few kids getting autographs from Marino and other players, ending on Ace dressed up and looking like a pimply kid. As the players sign, he checks their rings. EXT. TRACK - DAY Ace is again trying to catch the large man on the track. This time, just as he draws near, the man leaves him in the dust. INT. SPORTS BAR - DAY Two big guys finish arm wrestling. Ace steps up to challenge. He spends an undue amount of time preparing his grip, as he checks out the ring. Ace finally gets set and gives the "go ahead" nod. He is instantly thrown across the room. CLOSE ON The poster of the '82 team. Another group of players are being crossed out. EXT. STREET Ace spots a player driving along side him. He can't see his ring. Ace deliberately cuts off the player's car and flips him off. The angry player flips Ace off. We see his ring is intact. Ace waves and drives off. INT. MEN'S ROOM One huge lineman uses a urinal. Ace, using the urinal next to him, nonchalantly tries to catch a glimpse of the guy's hands. The Lineman has a very angry look on his face, but after a beat it changes to a "come on" smile. CLOSE ON The poster of the '82 team. There is only one face that has not been crossed out. Ace circles it. EXT. TRACK - DAY Once again we see the large, fast man jogging toward camera. Suddenly Ace runs up behind him, with a desperate look on his face, pouring a bottle of chloroform into a cloth. He leaps onto the man's back, smothering him with the cloth and holding on for dear life. The man slowly gives up the fight and collapses. Ace casually checks the ring, then walks away disappointed. EXT. MELISSA'S BACKYARD - EARLY EVENING Ace sits in a lawn chair depressed. Melissa consoles him. MELISSA Ace, that stone could have come from anywhere. An earring, a necklace ACE (with murder in his eyes) It came from an '82 AFC Championship ring. MELISSA Lt. Einhorn thinks it was an animal rights group. Have you heard of FAN? ACE Free Animals Now? Started in 1982 by Chelsea Gamble, daughter of the famous industrialist, Fischer Gamble? Over half a million members from Florida to Finland? (beat) No. Who are they? MELISSA Did you know that last year they sent threatening letters to 127 college teams, demanding the release of their mascots? At last count  ACE What do you feed your dog? We see Melissa's dog lying near Ace's feet. MELISSA Ah dog food, why? ACE He's miserable. MELISSA What are you talking about? ACE He's just very unhappy, I feel sorry for him. Bad diet, isolated environment. It's amazing he's still alive. MELISSA You're just mad because your stupid pebble theory didn't work out and you don't know how to express your anger. ACE Yeah? And you're ugly. MELISSA I'm not even gonna' talk to you, please leave. ACE What, so you can beat him? Fatty! MELISSA You are unbelievable. The phone rings inside the house. Melissa goes to answer it. MELISSA Hiring you was a huge mistake! The door slams and Ace is alone with the dog. After a moment he reaches down to pet it and we all see that it is one of the happiest dogs in the world. ACE You like her, huh? Yeah, she's alright. Ace, feeling guilty, walks into the house. INT. MELISSA'S DEN - CONT Ace walks toward Melissa. ACE Look, Melissa, I, ah Ace stops when he sees Melissa. She is sitting, holding the phone in her lap with a completely stunned look on her face. Something is very wrong. EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT Chaos. Police, lights flashing, paramedics, crowds of people. Ace and Melissa see Roger Podacter's body taken away in an ambulance. ACE You okay? Melissa nods bravely. Emilio joins them. ACE What'd you find? EMILIO Podacter, Roger. Routine suicide. He was alone. He'd been drinking. No sign of a struggle. Neighbor heard him scream on the way down. Just your classic fifteen story swan dive. Melissa shudders. Ace gives Emilio a "way to go" look. EMILIO Sorry. INT. HIGHRISE LOBBY - NIGHT The three enter. Emilio pushes the button for the elevator. MELISSA It just seems so out of character. He was going to retire in two years. ACE Did he leave a note? The elevator arrives. EMILIO No. That's nothing unusual. Some do, some don't. He didn't. The elevator doors close. INT. PODACTOR'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER Police are everywhere. Emilio, Ace and Melissa enter and are immediately approached by one of the officers. EMILIO Miss Robinson, this is officer Carlson. CARLSON Evening, ma'am. I wonder if you could answer a few questions about the deceased? Ace slips away, we follow him as he eavesdrops on conversations. NEIGHBOR (to a cop) I told you, I was across the hall in my apartment, I heard a scream. The door was locked, so I called the manager The Manager reiterates her story to the cop. The Manager is about 100 years old. MANAGER The place was empty, except for the damn dog in the other room. Then I opened the balcony door, looked over the railing, and splat, bang, pancake time Ace, continuing his investigation notices PODACTER'S DESK in perfect order. Next, he notices police coming in and out of the balcony, closing the door behind them, shutting out the noise. INT. PODACTER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT A dog is cowering in the corner. Ace tries to comfort the little guy. ACE Hey, fella, have a bad night? Ace examines its paws. Ace then gets down and finds scratches in the door. TWO FEET interrupt. Ace stands. He is face to face with Einhorn. EINHORN Who let Dr. Doolittle in? Emilio steps in immediately. EMILIO Ah, Lieutenant. He came with Miss Robinson  EINHORN This is official police business. We'll let you know if the coroner finds any ticks. Cops snicker. EMILIO I just thought since Melissa  ACE E, forget it. She's right. Besides, I wouldn't want someone tracing my steps and pointing out all the mistakes I made. Ace crosses to EXT. PODACTER'S BALCONY - CONT Ace examines the area. Einhorn is in hot pursuit. EINHORN Oh, so, you don't think this in an obvious suicide, Mr. Pet Detective? ACE Well, I wouldn't say that. Lord knows, there is plenty of evidence here to support your theory, except of course that spot of blood on the balcony. On the railing, sure enough, there is a tiny spot of blood. Einhorn glares at a couple of nearby cops. They look down. ACE May I tell you what I think happened? Alrighty then! Ace moves as he talks. ACE Roger Podacter went out after work. He had a few drinks, and he came home. But he wasn't alone. Someone was with him in this apartment. There was a struggle, and then Roger Podacter was thrown over that balcony. Roger Podacter didn't commit suicide. He was murdered. A beat as everyone considers this. EINHORN Well, that's a very entertaining story, but real detectives have to worry about that little thing lawyers call evidence. Ace picks up a lottery ticket on Podacter's desk and becomes a condescending kid show host. ACE Let's take a trip to clue corner, shall we? Can anyone tell me why a man buys a lottery ticket on the day he is going to commit suicide? Or why the family pet, suffering from acute canine trauma, clawed at the bedroom door until his paws bled? How about the blood on the railing? I'll bet if we put our thinking caps on we'll see that it was the result of the struggle that took place inside this apartment while Mr. Podacter was still alive! (singing) NEXT TIME YOU DON'T HAVE A CLUE COME ON BACK TO CLUE CORNER! BOOP! Everyone looks to Einhorn. EINHORN Not a bad try for a pet detective, but not near conclusive enough for us real investigators. (beat) First, people buy lottery tickets everyday. It's a habit. It doesn't prove a thing. Second, the dog wasn't suffering from canine trauma, he was suffering from bladder trauma. Sergeant Neilson found a piss stain as big as Lake Huron near the bed. And third, the blood on the railing. Simple. He doesn't jump far enough and whacks his head. A fact confirmed by the paramedics who found cuts on his scalp, with traces of a white chalky substance. i.e. plaster from the balcony. Einhorn shows Ace the paramedics report. Everyone is impressed with Einhorn. EINHORN So much for your murder, Ventura. AGUADO Uh oh, I think I heard a toilet flush. Maybe someone lost their turtle? Everyone has a laugh. Ace looks beaten. ACE Well, maybe I'm just a little out of my league, here. Einhorn Ace holds out his hand, Einhorn shakes it. ACE good work. Ace and Melissa head for the door. ACE Oh, there is just one more thing, Lieutenant. (re: the neighbor) This man is Roger Podacter's neighbor. He lives across the hall. He said he heard a scream, is that right, sir? The neighbor nods. Ace turns to the apartment manager. ACE And you said you had to open the balcony door when you keyed into the room? MANAGER That's right. Ace walks out onto the balcony and turns, facing them. ACE You're certain you had to open this door? She nods. EINHORN What's the point, Ventura? ACE Only this AAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWW Ace sustains an incredible Pavorati note, while he repeatedly opens and closes the glass door between them. When the door is closed nothing can be heard. ACE (tapping the door) This is double paned, sound- proofed glass. There's no way this neighbor could have heard Podacter scream on the way down with this door shut. The scream he heard came from inside this apartment, before Podacter was thrown over the railing! And the muderer closed the door before he left! (celebrates insanely) Yes! Yesss! I have exorcised the demons! (a la Poltergeist) This house is clear. INT. ACE'S CAR - A SHORT TIME LATER Ace drives straight ahead. MELISSA What are you thinking? ACE I'm thinking this whole thing is connected somehow. (frustrated) I'm thinking I want to find that other ring! MELISSA You checked all the rings. ACE I know, Pessimistress. Could anyone else have gotten a ring that year? MELISSA No. Camp was the only honoree. Just players and coaches. Everyone in the photo. ACE Receipts! There must be receipts! You have a key to the office. MELISSA Ace this has been a really tough day. Can't we do this in the morning? Ace looks at his watch. ACE Absolutely. EXT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - 1:00 AM Ace's car screeches to a stop, in front of the building. Ace jumps out, followed by Melissa. INT. DOLPHIN HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT It's dark. Team pictures adorn the walls. MELISSA (O.S.) These files go back to seventy- eight. INT. DOLPHIN OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Ace is flipping through a file cabinet, looking at receipts. Melissa is starting to warm to him. MELISSA That was pretty impressive, what you did back at the apartment. ACE (still looking) You don't have to tell me. I was there. MELISSA Maybe you should have joined the police force become a real detective. ACE (shaking his head) I don't do humans. Melissa gets a bit closer. MELISSA You really love animals, don't you? Ace stops searching and looks into her eyes. ACE I feel a kinship with them. I understand them. Wanna hear something kinda spooky? MELISSA Sure. She gets closer still. ACE One time, when I was about twelve, I had this dream that I was being followed by a dog with rabies. He had these really bloodshot eyes and foam coming out of his mouth and just before I got to my front door he jumped on me and sunk his teeth in. Then I woke up, and felt the back of my neck check this out. Ace motions for Melissa to feel the back of his neck, but when she does, he snaps at her hand, barking like a vicious dog. ACE ARARAR!!! Melissa jumps out of her skin. MELISSA Ohhh!! You bastard! ACE (snickering) I'm sorry. I couldn't stop myself. Are these all the receipts? MELISSA (mildly annoyed) I don't know. ACE There's only a dozen of them here. Ace turns from the file cabinet with a hopeless look on his face. Melissa begins to clean up his mess. MELISSA (pointedly) Gee maybe they were misplaced because somebody didn't put the files back when he was ACE Who the hell is that? MELISSA What Ace crosses to a big picture of the '82 team that hangs on the aadjacent wall and points out a player. ACE That! Who the hell is that?! He quickly pulls out his crossed out pictures of the team and begins to compare the two. MELISSA Oh, that's Ray Finkle the kicker. Don't you know who Ray Finkle is? ACE No! How come he's not in this picture?! Melissa checks Ace's photo. MELISSA This was the picture you were using? This was taken earlier in the year. Finkle wasn't added to the roster till mid-season. She starts to realize what Ace has already figured out. MELISSA (CONT'D) He's the guy that missed the final field goal in the Super Bowl that year. Cost the Dolphins the game. ACE But he got a ring? MELISSA Definitely. INT. STADIUM/PUBLIC RELATIONS OFFICE - LATER Ace and Melissa look through Finkle's file on a microfiche screen. Newspaper articles, headshots flash before them MELISSA 'Replacement Kicker Having Great Year' 'Ready For Super Bowl, Confident Kicker Boasts'. ACE 'Field Goal Sails Wide, Dolphins Lose Super Bowl'. MELISSA The kick heard round the world. That was Finkle. The Dolphins lost by one point. Another headline hits the screen: FINKLE CONTRACT NOT RENEWED. MELISSA Poor guy. ACE Poor guy with a motive, baby. Where is he now? MELISSA Last I heard, he went back to his home town, Collier County. He used to work in a bar up there. ACE (pondering) REHEHEALLY. MELISSA Can you drop me off before you go? ACE (shaking his head) No way. It may not be safe at your apartment, and you shouldn't be left alone. MELISSA What do you suggest? CUT TO: INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - LATER We see a person's butt under a sheet coming up into frame repeatedly. SKIN, SWEAT, SHEETS FLY, as Ace and Melissa roll back and forth on the bed. Ace is taking no prisoners. CUT TO: 50 animals at the bottom of the bed, with eyes as big as silver dollars, watching them silently. We cut back and forth between furious lovemaking and shots of staring animals. Melissa and Ace simultaneously reach the pinnacle of pleasure. MELISSA (totally amazed and exausted) OH man oh man! Oh wow! ACE (mock embarrassment) I'm sorry that's never happened to me before. I must be tired. EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY Various traveling shots of Ace en route to a 'Deliverance' type town deep in the Everglades. A sign reads "Gas - Food - 2 Miles" but the word "Food" is crossed out. INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY A pitifully sad country song plays on the radio. FERN BILBO sits at his cluttered desk with the end of an old shotgun in his mouth. He is struggling to reach the trigger. Through the glass behind him, we see Ace's car pull up to the only gasoline pump. DING! The bell rings. Fern begrudgingly takes the gun out of his mouth, sets it down and walks out. EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT Ace gets out of his car. ACE Excuse me, sir. Do you know where I can find the Pigskin Sports Bar? FERN Do I have a "kick me" sign on my back, son? ACE I wouldn't know anything about that, but if you could point me toward the bar. Fern breaks down, sobbing. FERN They all left me all of them! ACE Well Hypothetically speaking, say they all left you and went to the Pigskin Sports Bar. How would they have gotten there from here? FERN Two miles down and take the first left. ACE Thanks very much! Take care now, 'bye 'bye then! Ace gets into his car and pulls out. INT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - CONT Fern enters, sits down at the desk, places the end of the shotgun in his mouth, reaches for the trigger and DING! Another car pulls up to the pump. Exasperated, he takes the gun out of his mouth. FERN (murmers to himself as he gets up) Can't get anything done around here EXT. PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY A weathered dive in the middle of a swamp. Ace parks. INT PIGSKIN SPORTS BAR - DAY If depression had a home, this is it. Several dejected men, with various degrees of missing teeth, sit around the bar. A couple hapless guys play pool. One throws darts. Ace enters, pops a sunflower seed in his mouth and addresses the room. ACE Excuse me, guy?! My name is Ace Ventura, I'm a pet detective. I'd like to ask you a few questions if I could. No one even looks at him. ACE Just a few questions, that's all. Still no one reacts. ACE (very up) Who wants gum?! Again, no reaction. Ace walks over to the bartender and slides a five across the bar. ACE I'm looking for a guy who used to work here. The bartender takes the money. BARTENDER That right? ACE He was a kicker for the Dolphins. Ray Finkle. A pool ball flies by Ace's head shattering a mirror behind the bar. All eyes are on Ace. ACE (to guy who threw it) That would be a scratch. TOOTHLESS GIANT You a friend of Finkle's? ACE (thinks) Yes? CRASH! The giant guy smashes his bottle. ACE Sorry, I have "say the opposite of what you mean" disease. Several undesirables surround Ace. TOOTHLESS GIANT That bastard ruined this town. ACE Ewww I hate that! HICK #2 We bet everything we had on that Super Bowl and that son of a bitch gagged. ACE What a diiick! They all move closer in a threatening manner. HICK #3 Shanked a goddamn 26 yarder!!! ACE Death to Finkle! Death to Finkle! The bartender steps in. BARTENDER We had a hell of a thing going here. Tourists coming to see Ray Finkle's home town. He was standing right over there when he got the call from the Dolphins. The bartender points to a payphone. It has had the shit beaten out of it. Every expletive you can think of is graffitied around it. ACE Did he come back after the Super Bowl? BARTENDER Yeah but the boys here had ways of letting him know he wasn't welcome. HICK #1 Excuse me, I gotta take a wicked Finkle. Laughter. TOOTHLESS GIANT What's the difference between Finkle and a jackass? A jackass can kick. More laughter. HICK #2 Why did Finkle cross the road?! ACE (facetious) Wait I know this one. HICK #2 He didn't! And I've got the hair on my bumper to prove it! Maniacal laughter and chanting ensues. MOB FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS! ACE It's good you're dealing with the anger. (beat) I don't suppose anyone's seen him lately? The chanting stops and the guys all look at Ace. BARTENDER No but we know where his parents live! Don't we boys?! HICK #1 Yeah! We sure do! They all laugh insanely again. EXT. HOUSE - DAY Ace pulls up outside a two-story stilt house. The place has been completely desecrated by graffiti, bullet holes and paint bombs. Toilet paper is strewn through the trees. Ace walks up and knocks on the door. A wooden peephole slides open revealing a suspicious pair of eyes. ACE Hi, I'm looking for Ray Finkle. A gun slides out into Ace's face. ACE (with a gulp) And a clean pair of shorts. A deep gruff voice from inside. VOICE What do you know about Ray Finkle? ACE Southpaw soccer style kicker. Graduated from Collier High in June, 1976. Stetson University honors graduate, class of 1980. Holds two NCAA division one records. One for most points in a season, one for distance. Former nickname The Mule. The first and only pro athlete ever to come out of Collier County. And one helluva model American. After a beat the peephole closes. The door slowly creaks open revealing MR. FINKLE, an unsmiling, taciturn, elderly man holding the gun. MR. FINKLE Are you another one of them scumbags from 'Hard Copy'? ACE No, sir. I'm just a very big Finkle fan. This is my Graceland, sir. Mrs. Finkle, a sweet, adorable elderly woman comes over. MRS. FINKLE Will you put that gun down. The boy's a fan of our son. So nice to meet you. I'm Ray's mother, and this is Ray's father. INT. FINKLE HOUSE - DAY ACE It's a real honor. MRS. FINKLE My Ray is so appreciative of his fans. He'll be so pleased you stopped by. ACE Are you expecting Ray anytime soon? MRS. FINKLE Oh, yes. I expect him home any minute. Ace is surprised. MRS. FINKLE Would you like some cookies? I just baked them. Mrs. Finkle hurries off to the kitchen. Ace smiles at Mr. Finkle. The guy's a corpse. ACE Wow Ray Finkle's house! Can't wait to meet him! MR. FINKLE Ray ain't comin' home. ACE But your wife said you expect him home any minute. MR. FINKLE She expects him home any minute. He points to his head, and looks toward the kitchen. MR. FINKLE Engines runnin but there's no one behind the wheel. Ten years ago our son escaped from Shady Acres Psychiatric Hospital in Tampa. They're still buggin' us to pick up his stuff. Mrs. Finkle returns with a plate of football shaped cookies. MRS. FINKLE (sweetly) It was all that Dan Marino's fault, everyone knows that. If he had held the ball laces out, like you're supposed to, Ray would never have missed that kick. Dan Marino should die of Gonorrhea and rot in Hell. Would you like a cookie, son? Ace takes a cookie. Holding it up. ACE Hey, what do ya know. They're little footballs. MRS. FINKLE Laces OUT! CRASH!! A large stone smashes through the window. Outside, a pickup truck filled with drunken patrons from the Pigskin Sports Bar drives by yelling their Finkle chant. MOB FINKLE SUCKS! FINKLE SUCKS! MRS. FINKLE I told you he had a lot of fans. Mrs. Finkle picks up the rock and hurls it out the broken window. It hits one of the vandals, knocking him out cold, as the truck peels away. MR. FINKLE (aside to Ace) She got the arm. The boy got the leg. INT. HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER Mrs. Finkle and Ace are walking down the hallway to Ray's room. MRS. FINKLE When Ray gets back and starts kicking again, he'll never even know he was gone. I kept his room just the way he left it. She opens the door to Ray's room. Ace steps in. INT. RAY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS It's a death shrine to Dan Marino. Complete with lifesize cutouts of Dan Marino, some with nooses around the neck, other hacked to pieces. Painted on the walls: "Death to Marino!", Marino must die!!!, etc. ACE Oooh boy. MRS. FINKLE What a sports nut, huh? In the center of the room is a movie projector. ACE May I? MRS. FINKLE Oh yes. By all means. Mrs. Finkle shuts the lights off. Ace turns on the projector. The film flickers over the "Marino must die!!!" graffiti. It's the final play of the Super Bowl. Marino takes the snap, Finkle kicks and the ball sails wide. The film repeats itself ad infinitum. EXT. BILBO'S GAS STATION - DAY Ace on the payphone. We see the gas station in the background. ACE Melissa, it's Ace. INT. MELISSA'S OFFICE - DAY MELISSA Ace? Where are you? INTERCUT ACE/MELISSA ACE I'm in Psychoville and Finkle's the Mayor. Where's Dan Marino? MELISSA Marino? Why? ACE Because he's about to join Snowflake. I gotta know where he is. MELISSA Okay, hold on Melissa checks Marino's itinerary. Ace waits, impatiently. ACE (to himself) Come on. Come on In the background, we see two paramedics exit the gas station office rolling a dead body on a gurney. The area of the sheet that covers the face is a giant red spot. We widen to see them load good old Mr. Bilbo into an ambulance and drive away, ringing the station bell one more time. Ace doesn't notice. MELISSA Ah, he had practice. Then he has a commercial shoot out at the Prescott Sound Stage. ACE Where is that? MELISSA It's on Route One by the Six Cut Off. Thirty minutes outside of town. ACE Okay, that's about fifteen miles from me. Call the police. Get extra security over there now. MELISSA Ace, tell me what's going on. (beat) Ace? The payphone dangles off the hook. Ace is EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY in his car racing out of the swampland, his heaad now back out the window so he can see. He leaves a faded, old, barely legible sign in his wake: " WELCOME TO COLLIER COUNTY. HOME OF RAY FINKLE" The "F" in "FINKLE" has been replaced with "ST" in spray paint. INT. PRESCOTT STUDIOS - DAY Rehearsal for an Isotoner ad in progress. MARINO So I protect the hands that protect me. With Isotoners. Marino gets carted off by FIVE HUGE LINEMEN. DIRECTOR Good. Remember, exit camera right. That's to your left. Alright, let's get ready to shoot this. FIRST A.D. (to the linemen) Helmets on this time! The linemen disperse. EXT. STREET - DAY Ace runs a red light causing cars to skid in every direction. INT. PRESCOTT STUDIO - DAY Marino is in the make-up chair. MARINO (to make-up girl) See, in 82 we just choked. We had a chance to win it and we didn't  DIRECTOR Dan, are you ready? MARINO Ah, sure. (to girl) I'll tell you later. EXT. STUDIO - DAY The cops race onto the lot. INT. STUDIO - DAY Marino takes center stage. A.D. Quiet on the set roll speed DIRECTOR And action! MARINO Hi, I'm Dan Marino. If anyone knows the value of protection, it's me We see an old clip of Marino getting sacked. EXT. STUDIO - DAY Cops scramble on foot to the sound stage. INT. STUDIO - DAY The commercial is winding up. The linemen ready themselves. MARINO So I protect the hands that protect me. With Isotoners. The five linemen grab Marino and run off camera. DIRECTOR And cut! That was good. Again from one. But two of the linemen keep running with Marino DIRECTOR I said cut!! And they keep running. DIRECTOR (CONT'D) What the hell are they doing? Right out the studio door. Then the cops arrive and race after them. Two linemen stumble out of the dressing room holding their heads. EXT. SOUND STAGE - DAY Ace skids around a corner, looking way up ahead. He sees Marino being shoved into a black 81 Ford Bronco. They drive off. The cops come out of the building on foot. Too late. Ace in hot pursuit almost runs the cops down. ACE (yelling at cops) S'cuse meee! Pet Detective! EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY Ace's head is out the driver's window through the entire chase. As he starts gaining on the bad guys, they start shooting. Ace wisely puts his head inside the car. ACE'S POV He can't see shit through his broken windshield. He pokes his head out again. They shoot again. Ace swerves off the road into EXT. PARK - DAY Ace's car smashes through benches and tables. Then it flips over a few times and lands on its wheels with a horrid SMASH. Ace is still strapped into the drivers seat, unconscious. Ace's prized WHITE PIGEON lands on the car door right beside him. Ace cracks his eyes and sees the bird. Then, with a sudden quick lunge he successfully traps it in his hands, and forgets all about Marino. ACE I did it! I did it! I caught the white pigeon! I caught the white pigeon! Ace jumps out of his car and starts skipping around the park with the pigeon held high over his head. He looks insane. ACE (CONT'D) (singing) I caught the white pigeon, I caught the white pigeon, I caught the white Ace slows down and begins to look around warily. There are now an unusual number of birds perched on the telephone wires around the park and on the monkey bars, and on the swings. The sky grows darker. He slowly turns and tries to get back to the car. All the birds take flight. Ace sets the white pigeon free and starts to run, but it's too late. The birds are on him. Pecking, and gouging, and ripping his flesh. Now we see ten birds flying away with a leg. Five birds flying away with an arm. Twenty others are trying to take Ace's left arm off, and half his face is missing ACE AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! CUT TO: EXT. PARK - DAY Ace is back in his wrecked car with his arm hanging out the window. A small boy is pulling it. BOY Hey mister. Hey mister. Ace come to suddenly, and looks at the boy with a crazed expression. BOY (CONT'D) That was a really neat crash, mister. Do it again! Ace sighs with relief. EXT. MIAMI - DAY Various headlines hit the news stands: "MARINO KIDNAPPED" "STAR QB MISSING" "DAN WHERE ARE YOU?" THE GLOBE HEADLINE: "MARINO ABDUCTED BY ALIEN FRANCHISE!" On the cover, Marino stands with several Space Aliens in football gear. EXT. POLICE STATION - LATER THAT DAY A chaotic press conference. Zillions of REPORTERS shout all kinds of questions at Einhorn. REPORTER Lieutenant, have there been any ransom demands? EINHORN There's been no communication with the kidnappers at this time. REPORTER #2 What's going to happen to the Super Bowl? Will it be postponed? EINHORN As of now, the game is going on as scheduled. REPORTER #3 Why wasn't the public told about Snowflake's kidnapping? EINHORN Secrecy was essential. We didn't want any public interference. REPORTER Are the crimes related? And what about Roger Podacter's murder? EINHORN I'm sorry. I can't comment any further. Now if you'll excuse me. Einhorn pushes her way through the crowd of reporters. INT. POLICE STATION - MOMENTS LATER Einhorn is barking out orders to other cops as she heads for her office. EINHORN Emilio, get me the autopsy on Podacter! Aguado, send out a memo. No one talks to the press INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION EINHORN And somebody get me a cup of coffee! ACE (TV announcer's voice) Tonight on "MIAMI VICE", Crockett geets the boss coffee! Ace is in her office, popping sunflower seeds, kicking back. Einhorn walks to her private bathroom. EINHORN Ventura, when I get out of this bathroom, you better be gone. ACE Is it number one or number two? Einhorn turns and glares at Ace. ACE I just want to know how much time I have. Einhorn goes to the sink and begins washing her hands. ACE Oh, by the way, I went ahead and solved that pesky, Snowflake/Podacter/Marino thing. EINHORN (O.S.) (humoring him) Oh yeah? ACE yeah, ever hear of a former Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle? The water shuts off. Einhorn appears around the corner. EINHORN Alright, Ventura. Make it quick. ACE I found a rare stone at the bottom of Snowflake's tank. It's from a Dolphin '82 AFC Championship ring. It would have been a Super Bowl ring, but Ray Finkle missed the big kick. Blames the whole thing on Marino. We're talking paranoid, delusional psychosis. I saw the guy's room Cozy, if you're Hannibal Lector. EINHORN So how does Roger Podacter fit in? ACE My guess is Finkle was snooping around. Podacter recognized him. End of story. As for Snowflake they gave him Finkle's number, and taught him how to kick a field goal. Finkle took it personally. Einhorn listens with great interest. EINHORN So where is Finkle, now? ACE He broke out of a metal hospital. Did a Claude Raines. He's been planning his revenge for years. Waiting for the perfect time to get back at the Dolphins. The time when it would hurt them the most. Super Bowl time! Man, I'm tired of being right! Einhorn walks in front and sits on the edge of the desk. She's totally softened her demeanor. EINHORN Congratulations. You've done some fine detective work, Ace. ACE Ahh, could you talk in my good ear. I thought I heard you call me Ace. Einhorn gets real close. EINHORN Maybe I was wrong about you. Maybe you are more than just a pet dick. SHE SUDDENLY PLANTS A MAJOR, TONSIL CLEANING, OPEN MOUTHED KISS ON ACE. Objects are knocked off the desk as they lean back. ACE Your gun's digging into my hip. More kissing, the Ace stops. EINHORN (still coming on) What's wrong, Ace? Want me to read you your rights? ACE Maybe later. EINHORN What is it? That bony little bitch, Melissa Robinson? ACE (defensive) No. You just don't do anything for me. He quickly adjusts his crotch, to conceal the erection. Einhorn withdraws with a coy smile. EINHORN I'll be here if you ever want a real woman. There's a sharp KNOCK at the door. EINHORN What is it? Aguado opens the door. AGUADO Everything okay in here? Heard some commotion. EINHORN Fine, Sergeant. AGUADO You want me to throw him out? EINHORN Why don't you throw yourself out. AGUADO Yes, ma'am. A crestfallen Aguado exits. Ace heads for the door. EINHORN Ace, I want you to leave everything to us. ACE Can't do that, Lieutenant. I was hired to find Snowflake. EINHORN When we find Marino, We'll deliver Snowflake. ACE When I find Snowflake, I'll deliver Marino. He exits. INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT A full on thrash metal band is cranking on stage. Kids leap wildly into the moshing pit. The same Burnout is still thrashing his head wildly to the music. ACE (shouting) Nice to see you again! The Burnout just keeps thrashing. Ace spots Woodstock watching the band and joins him. WOODSTOCK St. Francis, how's it goin'? ACE (kidding) That's none of your damn business. WOODSTOCK Isn't it? ACE Is it? WOODSTOCK Anything new on that dolphin? ACE Got his picture on some tuna cans, but nothing so far. A singer ROARS on stage. He sounds like a garbage disposal full of cutlery. SINGER Arroohhghhh! Myrrrooohghhhh! Geroooghhh! WOODSTOCK So, what can I do for you today? ACE I need info on a football flunky named Ray Finkle. WOODSTOCK Sorry, Ace, I can't help you right now. I gotta watch this band! They are the shit! ACE Are they? WOODSTOCK Aren't they? ACE Alright then. Don't worry about it. I mean dolphins aren't exactly an endangered species. It's not like the whole food chain's gonna be affected if one highly intelligent mammal dies a slow and painful death! Hell, if the band is loud enough, you won't even hear its pitiful whimpering!! Ace does his best suffering dolphin impression. Woodstock is no longer enjoying the band. CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT Woodstock is at his computer. Ace looks over his shoulder. Finkle's Social Security information appears on the screen. WOODSTOCK This guy's last reported income was September, 1982. ACE Well then. We know he's incredibly thrifty. WOODSTOCK Is he? ACE Isn't he? Woodstock types in more information. Finkle's TRW flashes on the screen. WOODSTOCK Well, I think we can be pretty sure he's involved in the kidnapping of the dolphin. ACE Really? What makes you say that? WOODSTOCK There's two-thousand dollars worth of smelts on his VISA card. After a beat Ace realizes it was a bad joke. ACE Please yank me no further. I beg of you. WOODSTOCK Alright already. The last time this guy used his credit card was June, '84. He rented a car from Avis. And eww he was a bad boy. They found it abandoned two months later in South Miami. ACE Anything else? WOODSTOCK Nope. ACE Well you did all you could. Thanks for nothin. WOODSTOCK Hey man, according to this, your friend Ray Finkle doesn't exist. ACE Hmm, I know what that's like. WOODSTOCK Do you? ACE Don't I? INT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT Ace emerges from the basement. The band is between songs. Ace strolls by the burnout whose head has now stopped. ACE (to burnout) Did you get all the spiders outta there? Ace heads out, then freezes. The two thugs that took Marino are standing at the exit. Then they see Ace and start towards him, reaching inside their coats. Suddenly the music starts. The burnout's head wails again. His manic gyrations interfere with the thugs long enough for Ace to bolt. One of the thugs pushes the burnout violently against the wall as they pursue Ace. BURNOUT (calling, as he gets up) Thanks, man! You're a great dancer! Ace pushes his way through the crowd. The thugs follow. Ace nears the stage. It's wild. People are diving off and getting moshed. Before the thugs grab him, Ace runs up and throws himself from the stage. The insane crowd begins to pass him around over their heads. The thugs exchange a look, then dive after Ace, and a "mosh" chase ensues. Ace is passed back onto the stage as the song comes to an end. The singer is lying there exhausted. Ace sees the crowd starting to put the thugs down, so he quickly grabs the microphone off the floor. ACE (screams) ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, SPANK ME MOMMY!!! The audience looks at Ace for a second. Then the band members exchange a look and go for it!! It's a nightmarish little ditty. Ace sings like one of Satan's minions. ACE URGHHUURRAAAW! ARGHUURRRREEEW! The crowd seems to understand. They throw the thugs high in the air again and mosh them away from the stage. The Thugs are shooting stray bullets the whole time. Ace incites the crowd, even more now, with a punching gesture. The crowd follows their new leader, punching with one hand, moshing with the other. The thugs get the living crap "moshed" out of them. When the song ends, Ace raises fists in the air. The cheering crowd violently drops the thugs. They're out cold. EXT. TEA ROOM - NIGHT Ace's car PEELS OUT and races by the parked '81 Ford Bronco. EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Ace's car skids to a halt. He hops out. INT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT There's a loud BANGING at the door. Melissa awakens, looks at the clock: 3:32 a.m. She drags herself to the door. MELISSA Who is it? ACE (O.S.) Ira. MELISSA Ira who? ACE (O.S.) I refuse to do a 'knock knock joke'. Come on, open up! Melissa opens the door. MELISSA Ace, what are you doing? It's the middle of the night! ACE You have to commit me. EXT. HIGHWAY - DAWN Ace's clunker speeds down the highway. ACE (V.O.) Finkle escaped from Shady Acres in Tampa. They still have some of his stuff. MELISSA (V.O.) So you think they're going to let us just waltz in and look around? EXT. SHADY ACRES - ESTABLISHING - DAY A state hospital located on acres of green, manicured lawns. INT. SHADY ACRES - DAY The reception area. A DOCTOR is before Melissa. DOCTOR Mrs. Robinson? I'm Doctor Handly. Now who is it that you'd like to have us look at? MELISSA My brother Eugene. ANGLE ON ACE - Looking like the football player who never wore a helmet. ACE I'm ready to go in, Coach. Just give me a chance. I know there's a lot riding on it, but it's all psychological. Got to stay in a positive frame of mind. Memorize the play book. Study the films. Ace strikes a dramatic pose and freezes, with a crazed look on his face. ACE (CON'T) I'm gonna execute a button-hook pattern! He begins to make a play in slow motion. ACE (CON'T) Super slo-mo! CUT TO: EXT. SHADY ACRES HOSPITAL - DAY Melissa walks with the Doctor. Patients are sitting around, doing outdoor therapy, etc. DOCTOR You're brother won't be the first professional football player we've treated. MELISSA Is that right? DOCTOR Yes. We're very sensitive to the emotional stress athletes have to endure. Ace runs across the b.g. screaming "I'm open! I'm open!" DOCTOR We'll have to do some preliminary evaluations, but I think your brother will fit in nicely here. MELISSA That's a relief, Doctor. Ace takes a "snap" from a three-foot hedge and dives over it into the end zone. Melissa and the doctor stop to watch him. DOCTOR He seems to have some difficulty letting go of the game. Has he had a long history of mental illness? MELISSA (truthfully) As long as I've known him. Ace does a wild touchdown dance with some of the other patients participating. INT. SHADY GLADE ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY The doctor is showing Melissa around. Ace is walking alongside them adjusting his imaginary shoulder pads. DOCTOR This is our therapy room Arts and crafts They turn a corner. Ace squats to pick the dirt out of his cleats. DOCTOR (CON'T) That's the storage room. This hallway leads to another recreational area  Ace WHISTLES loudly and gestures like a referee ACE HALFTIIIIME!! Ace sticks his head in the water fountain then sits down on the bench outside the storage room. MELISSA He'll be fine by himself for the next twenty minutes. DOCTOR Well, why don't I show you the dormitories, then? They leave Ace. After a beat, Ace gets up and does a quick spin pattern into the storage room door. INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Cartons everywhere. Ace does a quick search and locates several boxes maked FINKLE. Ace looks through the first couple of boxes and finds only clothes. In the third box, he hits the jackpot: He finds sicko arts and crafts dedicated to Marino. Die-Dan potholders, shredded Isotoner gloves. He opens a little diary. "Laces Out!" is insanely scrawled on every page. Ace finds a newspaper clipping, the headline reads: SEARCH CALLED OFF FOR MISSING HIKER ACE (reading) A massive search ended today when rescue workers were unable to find the body of Lois Einhorn (stunned) a camper reported lost since Friday (to himself) Lois Einhorn holy shit balls. Ace sits bewildered. INT. POLICE STATION - DAY The phone rings at Emilio's desk. He answers it. EMILIO Echavez. INT. SHADY ACRES - HALLWAY - DAY Ace is on the phone. A CRAZY GUY is hovering nearby. ACE This is Chicken Little. The sky is falling. EMILIO What? BACK TO EMILIO A beat as he listens to Ace's news. EMILIO I don't get it. What's it mean? INTERCUT ACE/EMILIO ACE It means she's involved in this. The article's dated the day before Finkle disappeared. EMILIO Before who disappeared? ACE Finkle. Ray Finkle the guy who took the dolphin? The guy you're supposed to be looking for?! Einhorn didn't tell you, did she? EMILIO Hey, Ace. I see where you're goin' with this and you're goin' alone. A Crazy Guy stands next to Ace now and begins mimicking everything he says. ACE Come on, E. I tell her about Finkle, she doesn't tell a soul. I have an article here that connects her with Finkle. You gotta' check her out. (to Crazy Guy mimicking) Do you mind? The Crazy Guy stops and moves to one of the phones. EMILIO Ace, I like my job. I get health insurance and benefits. CRAZY GUY (into receiver) I'm the Lindberg Baby. Come and get me. ACE Emilio, Einhorn is involved. You're gonna' have to make a decision here. (beat) Listen, I gotta get off the phone. I think I just solved the Lindberg case. Melissa and the Doctor return. DOCTOR Well, look who's trying to use the phone. Ace covers the phone receiver and whispers to them in a heartfelt voice. ACE Brian Piccalo is dead. Ace breaks down. Melissa hangs up the phone and leads him away. We hear a thrash version of the theme to "Brian's Song" as they exit the hospital. INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT Emilio stands at a window, watching Einhorn drive off. The coast is clear so he sneaks into INT. EINHORN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS He rifles through her file cabinet. He tears through papers. Then he looks in her desk. Stuffed in the back of the drawer he finds a personal note: We can make out the signature. Roger. He pockets it and walks out. EXT. MELISSA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Ace and Melissa pull up in the old heap. ACE Good job today. You're quite a dirty rotten filthy liar. MELISSA (flattered) Thanks. Are you sure you don't want to stay here with me? ACE Naw, I got some thinking to do. Besides, you'd be safer with Salman Rushdie MELISSA Okay. She gets out of the car, then turns and leans in the window. MELISSA Listen I know there isn't much time left. The game is tomorrow. But I know you've done your best. It's just an impossible situation. I don't expect.. ACE Hey Ace leans over and kisses her. ACE (CONT'D) bet on the Dolphins. INT. ACE'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT CLOSE UP: ANSWERING MACHINE Wiggles' nose enters frame and hits the play button. MESSAGE #1 (Shickadance rasp) Venturaaaa? Your time is up! You're out! You hear me?! No rent no roof! We widen to find Ace on the couch listening. MESSAGE #2 Ace, it's E. Got something you might find interesting. It's a note from Podacter to Einhorn, thanking her for a wonderful Saturday night. This is too weird, man? ACE Wiggles, rewind. Wiggles obediently hits another button and rewinds the phone tape. Ace pops sunflower seeds, and holds some evidence aloft thinking. A bird eats seeds out of his naval. ACE What the hell does Lois Einhorn have to do with Ray Finkle? Come on, think! DISSOLVE TO: Later. Ace is posed like Rodin's "The Thinker". ACE Finkle and Einhorn. In it together. How? Why? A small monkey sits in the same position. Mocking Ace. DISSOLVE TO: Later still. Ace pacing, jumping up and down. Trying to get his intuitive juices flowing. The monkey is likewise, jumping on the mantle. ACE Alright! Here we go! Answer's right there! Just gotta get some blood to the brain! Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn! Finkle and Einhorn! The animals all watch him like he's crazy. DISSOLVE TO: Daybreak. Ace sits staring at a picture of Finkle on the coffee table. He's totally spent and on the verge of tears. ACE (whimpering) Finkle and Einhorn. Einhorn and Finkle. He turns to see the monkey crashed out in a heap on a sofa pillow. ACE (to sleeping monkey) Quitter. Wiggles jumps up onto the coffee table now. Ace can't be bothered with him. ACE What do you want? Huh? Wiggles whines at the tone of Ace's voice. ACE (CONT'D) What? I got no food for you. You gotta have money to buy food. I gotta find the dolphin to get the money. I don't see any dolphins around here, do you? Face it, it's hopeless your master is a LOSER. Ace buries his face in his hands. His dog Wiggles does the same. Then Ace looks up again. ACE LOO HOO Suddenly he is silenced by something amazing. Wiggles' dark haired floppy ears are lying around Finkle's picture like a wig. Ace combs the hair over the head shot. The "make-over" is unmistakable. It's Einhorn!! ACE Oh, my god! That's it! He jumps up, estatic. ACE Einhorn is Finkle! Finkle is Einhorn! Einhorn is a man!!! Ace's expression quickly turns sour. ACE OH MY GOD!!! EINHORN IS A MAN!!! MUSIC UP: AEROSMITH'S DUD LOOKS LIKE A LADY Ace makes a mad dash into the bathroom. INT. ACE'S BATHROOM - MORNING - QUICK CUTS Ace furiously brushes his teeth. Ace rinses with mouthwash, spits it out and gags. Ace is in the shower. He slowly curls up into a ball under the steaming water with an expression of horror on his face. INT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - DAY CLOSE UP: A woman's leg being shaved. Woman sexily putting on nylons. Woman hands squeezing perfume bulb. Woman's hand putting on AFC championship ring. One stone is missing. EXT. EINHORN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Ace sticks wads of gum in his mouth while he watches Einhorn's house from his car. ACE (remembering) You're gun is sticking into my hip. Yeeeekkkk! Einhorn comes out her front door and gets into her car. Ace shudders once more and then follows her. EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY The road is jammed in one direction. Going towards the Super Bowl. Einhorn drives in the opposite direction. Out of town. Ace tails her at a safe distance, with his head out the window, of course. INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY Various shots of crazy fans, piling into the stadium. INT. STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY Melissa, BOBBY RIDDLE, and GUESTS all amidst the usual pre-game hobnobbing. Most of the talk centers on the loss of Marino. Emilio, in full uniform, and a couple cops are providing extra security for the box. EXT. HIGHWAY ONE - DAY Einhorn drives south out of town. The area's getting remote. Ace follows. Einhorn turns down a deserted road and comes to EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY A large, abandoned industrial facility. Einhorn parks, disappears inside A few beats later, Ace kills the engine and exits singing the score to "Mission Impossible". INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY Immense machines and swimming pool sized cauldrons. Ace cautiously makes his way through the desolate site, singing quietly now. He stops when he hears a familiar voice. JOHN MADDEN (O.S.) I particularly like the match-ups of the defense. Ace sees a weird sight: A HUGE TV PROJECTION SCREEN tuned to the Super Bowl pre-game show. Marino is tied to a football tackling sled. The two thugs take turns running into Dan with their shoulders, driving him back five feet each time. JOHN MADDEN (ON TV) But the real story of this game is the absence of Dan Marino. Him being kidnapped and all has got to be a strain on this Miami team. I really feel sorry for those guys! I mean, it's hard enough enduring the pressure of the Super Bowl, without your star quarterback gettin' himself kidnapped. This is the whole ball of wax, folks! You wanna' get kidnapped, you do it in the off season! Marino looks incredulously at the screen. Next to him, Snowflake "watches" from a ground level cistern serving as an ad hoc tank. Ace sneaks closer. INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM - DAY The crowd quiets as Jon Bon Jovi prepares to sing the National Anthem. Various shots of fans all standing at attention. In the owners box, Melissa looks to Emilio. Nothing's new. INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY Einhorn is now in front of the big screen TV SINGING the National Anthem along with Bon Jovi. The thugs, VINNIE and ROC, are behind her standing at attention. The song ends. The crowd cheers. In a sultry fashion Einhorn circles Marino now. EINHORN I just love Super Bowl Sunday, don't you, Dan? A magical afternoon where dreams are made or crushed! DAN Look lady, if you want tickets, you're going about it in the wrong way. EINHORN Do I look familiar to you, Dan? Does it seem as if we've met someplace before? DAN I don't know I get hit in the head a lot! On the TV the ref makes an announcement. REF It's tails. The Eagles will receive. Dan really struggles now. EINHORN Oops. Looks like we're going to have to kick, Dan. Einhorn steps behind a football set up on a tee. And in perfect sync with the kicker on TV, she boots a ball through a window of the warehouse. Marino doesn't know what to think. EINHORN I made some refreshments, Dan. Would you like some refreshments, Dan? I'll be right back, Daaaan!! She goes. Dan struggles, but to no avail. MARINO Look, I don't know how much psycho woman is paying you guys, but I can double it. VINNIE Sorry, Danny boy. Psycho woman keeps us out of prison. Vinnie grabs a feeder fish and entices Snowflake to the surface. Roc raises a football. ROC Hey, Marino, check it out. I'm throwin' passes to a Dolphin! He chucks the ball and hits Snowflake, hard. The thugs both laugh hysterically. Snowflake makes an angry leap and drenches the thugs. Snowflake laughs now, the thugs are furious. VINNIE Get some more fish! INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS Roc walks behind a big piece of machinery, reaches down for the pail of smelts, but sees nothing. ROC Where the hell's the smelts? He stands up straight and we all hear that familiar "Pop" of a sunflower seed being cracked open. Roc's eyes widen. He turns and sees Ace coyly smiles at him, blows the sunflower seed shells into his face and CLANG! He whacks Roc in the head with a pail full of fish. ACE (doing Brando) He sleeps with the fishes. INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - CONTINUOUS VINNIE Hey Roc, what the hell was that? Vinnie cocks his gun and goes to check out the sound. INT. BEHIND MACHINERY - CONTINUOUS Vinnie rounds the corner and sees nothing. He walks a little further and notices a trail of smelts lined up on the ground. He follows the trail around a corner and we see Roc, unconscious but moaning. He is sitting against the ground, with his legs spread apart and the pail over his head. The trail of smelts leads to his crotch. There is one halfway into his zipper, with its tail flipping. Vinnie takes in this sight, then rushes over to Roc and stands him up. VINNIE Hey man! What happened? What's goin on? We see Ace at the top of a giant machine. He is aiming a 200 pound steel hook, that hangs on a chain from the ceiling. ACE Guess what, boys, it's nap time. Ace gently releases the hook. Just as Vinnie and Roc turn to look, the iron hook shears both of their heads clean off. Two headless bodies fall to the ground in slow motion with blood gushing from their necks. CLOSE ON ACE - HORRIFIED ACE Hooooly Shiiit! Oh my god! I didn't mean to - Oh man!!! Ace holds his head and dances around, completely freaking out what he had done. ACE (looking to God) Lord, I swear! I just wanted to knock them out! Ace abruptly stops to think. ACE Is that murder? I don't know. They were gonna kill me. But they didn't But they tried. That's self defense. That's it!! I have nothing to worry about!! CUT TO: Ace nervously whistling as he wipes his fingerprints off the hook. INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - FACTORY Ace checks on Snowflake then goes to Marino. He signals for Dan to keep quiet, then starts to untie him. MARINO (whispers) Who are you? ACE (whispers) Ace Ventura. Pet detective. I've been sent in with a special play. (whispers) Quarterback sneak. WE HEAR THE CLICK OF A GUN. EINHORN (O.S.) Penalty. Too many men on the field. Ace turns. Einhorn's holding a gun on them from the other side of Snowflake's tank. EINHORN (CON'T) I warned you, Ventura. ACE What happened to "Ace"? EINHORN Good question. She pulls out a cellular phone and dials. ACE Be careful with that phone, lieutenant. I wouldn't want you to get a tumor. EINHORN (into phone) Sergeant Aguado, it's Lt. Einhorn. Get some men over to the old ironworks factory on Victoria Road. I've got the kidnapper trapped in the warehouse. It's Ace Ventura. He's killed Marino and Snowflake. Einhorn smiles as she puts the phone away. EINHORN Vinnie! Roc! Get in here! Ace gets a very guilty look. ACE What? Who are they? You mean there's other people here? EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY A battalion of cop cars screech away as we hear RADIO DISPATCHER (V.O.) Attention all units. Code 11 in progress at 343 Victorville Road. Officer needs back-up INT. BOBBY RIDDLE STADIUM OWNER'S BOX - DAY The cops and Emilio listen to their ear pieces RADIO DISPATCHER (V.O.) Suspect's name: Ace Ventura, male Caucasian, he is armed and dangerous Emilio nudges Melissa. EMILIO It's Ace. Let's go. INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS Emilio high tails it out of there. Dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc Melissa runs behind, trying to catch up. MELISSA Emilio, is he in trouble? EMILIO Don't worry, there's nothing Ace can't handle! INT. IRONWORKS FACTORY - DAY Einhorn cocks her gun. Ace's face is glistening with tears. He's a complete wreck. ACE Don't kill meeee!! Pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! I'll never tell anyone! I swear! (indicating Marino) He's the one you want!! Kill him!! MARINO (indicating Ace) No kill him! The two argue. Einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them. EINHORN No, I'm gonna kill the dolphin first. (to Ace) I wouldn't want you to miss that. Einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. She aims the gun at Snowflake and FIRES! We see the bullet miss Snowflake under water. Snowflake swims wildly. She FIRES again! Misses again. Suddenly, Ace HOLLERS! ACE Blue forty-two!! Einhorn turns to Ace. EINHORN SHUT UP!! ACE BLUE FORTY-TWO! Einhorn shoots at Ace! He dives out of the way. ACE HUT! HUT! Suddenly, Snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of Einhorn's hand, like the trick we saw earlier. Snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth. ACE (smug) Yes. The highly trained dolphin. Perhaps the smartest mammal in the animal kingdom. See how he knew exactly what I wanted him to do, as if our minds were somehow in complete synchronization. They have been know to save men at sea you know. They have their own language. (to Snowflake) Snowflake. Come here, Snowflake! Bring me the gun! (makes dolphin sounds) EEEEEE! EEEEEE! EEEEEE! Just like the trick in his routine, however, Snowflake swims around the tank, passes Ace, then hands the gun back to Einhorn. He finishes with a tail walk. ACE (under his breath) Stupid fish. ON TV: Miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards. JOHN MADDEN He got all of his leg into that one! The field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates. ACE Good to see someone who doesn't buckle under the pressure? MARINO Yeah, not like in 82 when we choked Einhorn walks to Ace and puts the gun against his head. EINHORN What would you know about pressure? ACE Well, I've kissed a man. JOHN MADDEN (ON TV) Of course, there's never been a more crucial kick than the famous Kick heard 'round the world The famous footage airs on TV. They all turn to watch. JOHN MADDEN I mean, it's clear to me that it was a good hold. Finkle just booted it. EINHORN The laces weren't out. THE LACES WEREN'T OUT!! Einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in Madden's forehead. Ace uses the moment to smack the gun out of her hand. A HUGE, NO-HOLDS-BARRED FIGHT ensues. Ace and Einhorn punch each other about the face and stomach. Einhorn throws a punch at Ace. Ace goes down. Einhorn goes for the loose gun. Ace leaps and tackles her. They both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. Marino struggles all the while trying to get free. Einhorn kicks Ace. He flies into Marino. MARINO Having a little trouble with the lady, Ace? ACE (out of breath) You don't understand, she's a  Einhorn grabs Ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face. Meanwhile, cops start arriving, SWAT team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight continues. They try but can't get a bead on Ace as the two roll around on the floor. More punches. They fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. To the amazement of the SWAT team, Ace and Einhorn slug it out as equals. AGUADO (caught up) Get him, Lois! Now they crash through a plate glass window together. Ace gets to his knees first and wobbles toward the gun. It's the first clear shot the SWAT team has had. EINHORN (screaming) Shoot him! Shoot him! We all hear the guns cocked. We see Ace in the rifle sights. We see fingers twitch on triggers. A loud voice comes from off camera. EMILIO DON'T SHOOT! HOLD YOUR FIRE! Melissa is holding Emilio's gun under his chin. MELISSA Put down your guns or this cop gets it! The SWAT team hesitates. MELISSA (CONT'D) I mean it!! Much to Emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun. EMILIO (whispers to Melissa) Ah Melissa? That's a hair trigger. (loud to cops) She's not joking! The SWAT team leader signals his men. They lower their guns. Einhorn gets back to her feet. EINHORN He kidnapped Snowflake. He killed Roger Podacter, and he was about to kill Dan Marino and me! ACE Ho, ho! Fiction can be fun! But I find the reference section much more enlightening. (doing his best Clarence Darrow) For instance, if you were to look up 'professional football's all time bonehead plays', you might read about a Miami Dolphin kicker named Ray Finkle, who missed a twenty-six yard field goal in the closing seconds of Super Bowl Seventeen. (in one breath) What you wouldn't read about is how Ray Finkle lost his mind, and was committed to a mental institute, only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hker, seducing her way to the top, in a diabolical plan to get even with Dan Marino whom he blamed for the entire thing!!! Ace gasps for air. Everyone is totally confused. AGUADO What the hell are you trying to say? ACE She's not Lois Einhorn! She's Ray Finkle! She's a man! EINHORN He's lying! Shoot him! Ace walks over to her. ACE Let's just see who's lying. Would a real woman have to wear one of these? Ace dramatically pulls at Einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. Einhorn's head flies back. The hair is real. Ace keeps tugging it. The SWAT team ready themselves. ACE (CONT'D) Boy, that's really on there! But tell me this: Would a real woman be missing these?! Ace rips open Einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts. The sharp shooters are tensing. Ace is laughing nervously now. ACE Ha, ha, ha! That kind of surgery can be done over the weekend! But I doubt if she could find the time during her busy schedule to get rid of Mr. Knish!! Ace rips off Einhorn's skirt. Einhorn now stands there fully nude. She appears to be the perfect figure of a woman. ACE Oooh boy. Ace looks at Melissa and Emilio and shrugs his shoulders. Then, just when it seems all is lost, Dan Marino who is back behind Einhorn, motions for Ace to come over. MARINO Psst Ace. Come here. ACE (to everyone) Could you excuse me just a second. Ace goes to Dan. Melissa still holds Emilio hostage. EINHORN Shoot him. Shoot him, now!! MELISSA (to cops) Don't anybody make a move! Marino whispers something in his ear. Ace looks confident again. He once more addresses the crowd. ACE Ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed colleague Mr. Marino, has just brought some new evidence to my attention. Now, history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive criminal minds can be wrong, from time to time. But, if I have been mistaken if the lieutenant is indeed a woman then my friends, she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids I have ever seen!!! Ace spins Einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that Finkle has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (And if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.) Everyone gasps. CLOSE UP ON EINHORN/FINKLE. He finally drops the facade. FINKLE (deepest voice possible) It was Marino's fault. The laces were in. (breaking down now) They were IN!!! Quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. Then Emilio spits. Then CLOSE ON Marino spitting. They all have kissed her/him/it. Even Snowflake blows his spout. Ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed. ACE Somebody read it its rights. Suddenly, Finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at Ace. FINKLE DIE ANIMAL BOYYYYY!!! Thinking fast Ace sidesteps Finkle and sends him head first into Snowflake's makeshift tank. After a few seconds Finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly. FINKLE (gasping for air) Help I can't swim!!! Finkle goes under again. We see him under water sinking down. Snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls Finkle gently to the side of the pool. Finkle lies there exhausted. Ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 AFC Championship ring from Finkle's finger. We see that it's the ring with the missing stone. Ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. It's a perfect fit. ACE LLLOOOSER! LLOO HOO SERR HERR HERR!!! Melissa is still holding the gun on Emilio. EMILIO Melissa you can give me back my gun now. Melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. She hands it to Emilio and faints in his arms. Now Aguado appears beside Ace. AGUADO I don't know how you did it, Ventura but that was damn good police work. Alright guys, let's wrap this up! EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY Twenty or more police cars in single file provide more than ample escort for Ace and Marino in Ace's Chevy Bel-Aire with the cracked windshield. Both of them have their heads sticking out so that they can see. Marino has a wad of gum in his mouth. HIGH ANGLE The long line of flashing lights and cop cars drives at top speed up Route One. Ace's Bel-Aire right in the middle. MARINO (O.S.) hey Ace? ACE (O.S.) Yeah, Dan? MARINO (O.S.) Got any more gum? CUT TO: INT. STADIUM - DAY The Super Bowl Halftime Show is in progress. Marino is in uniform warming up. Emilio is drooling at the cheerleaders. Ace and Melissa are standing near the fifty yard line taking in the awesome spectacle. Some fireworks go off around the tank. A marching band plays a triumphant tune. We see a helicopter come up over the side of the stadium carrying Snowflake. ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, the Miami Dolphins are proud to welcome back to BOBBY RIDDLE Stadium, our beloved mascot and star of the halftime show ANGLE ON The helicopter lowering Snowflake into his tank. ANNOUNCER (O.S.) Snowflake!! As the crowd roars, Melissa turns to Ace, and with Snowflake in the background performing spectacular flips, they kiss. ANOTHER ANGLE As Melissa and Ace kiss, the prized 'White Pigeon' lands on a Gatorade dispenser in the foreground. Ace spots it and starts to make a move. Just as he closes in for the grab, the Philadelphia Eagles mascot eagle walks up to get a drink and shoos the pigeon away. Ace is furious. ACE You idiot! Do you know what you've done?! The giant eagle head looks up at Ace. MASCOT Huh? Ace grabs him. ACE You just cost me ten thousand bucks, Polly! MASCOT Yeah Blow me. ACE REE HEE HEE HEELYYY?!!! PULL BACK to find Eagle's mascot and Ace arguing. We can't hear what's said, but there's a lot of finger pointing. Emilio stops his leering to check out what's going on. The ANNOUNCER up in the booth reads a release. ANNOUNCER The National Football League would now like to offer a special thank you to the man who rescued Dan Marino and our beloved Snowflake On the field the mascot shoves Ace. Ace shoves back. ANNOUNCER (CONT'D) A great humanitarian, and lover of all animals Mr. Ace Ventura! Ace is straddling the eagle, pounding the shit out of giant head. The image is flashed on the big stadium screen. We freeze frame on this huge picture of Ace, as he looks into camera with his fist raised.

EXT. ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY

Endless barren landscape. No sign of life. The atmosphere
is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt. Meteors bombard.
Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water. Silence.

INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - MORNING

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CA, FOUR BILLION AND FORTY YEARS LATER

Beamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace. A few birthday
cards on the mantel, two of them identical: "To Our Dear Son
on His Fortieth Birthday." Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding
man in a purple sweater with tags still attached, paces the
room. His incantational voice-over carpets the scene.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I am old. I am fat. I am bald. My
          toenails have turned strange. I am
          repulsive. How repulsive? I don't know
          for I suffer from a condition called Body
          Dysmorphic Disorder. I am fat, but am I
          as fat as I think? My therapist says no,
          but people lie. I believe others call me
          Fatty behind my back. Or Fatso. Or,
          facetiously, Slim. But I also believe
          this is simply my own perverted form of
          self-aggrandizement, that no one really
          talks about me at all. What possible

EXT. STATE ROAD 29 - DAWN

A lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland.

                    BRITISH NARRATOR
          As natural selection works solely by and
          for the good of each being, all corporeal
          and mental endowments will tend to
          progress towards perfection.

Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.   It's
followed closely by an old green Ford.

SUBTITLE: STATE ROAD 29, FLORIDA, FIVE YEARS EARLIER

INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS

John Laroche drives. He's a skinny man with no front teeth.
The van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk.
A Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the
seat next to Laroche.

          It is interesting to contemplate an
          entangled bank, clothed with many plants
          of many kinds, with birds singing...

Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing
by. Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State
Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road
turn-off. The cassette case flies from the seat and half-
buries itself in an open bag of peat.

INT. GREEN FORD - CONTINUOUS

Nirvana blasts. Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young
Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead.

                    RUSSELL
          Laroche is asleep at the wheel.

They share a stoned laugh.

EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

SUBTITLE: NEW YORK, TWO YEARS LATER

Late night street. The click-click of typing. We move
slowly up the building to the only glowing window.

                    ORLEAN (O.S.)
              (wistful)
          John Laroche is a tall guy, skinny as a
          stick, pale-eyed, slouch-shouldered and
          sharply handsome despite the fact that he
          is missing all his front teeth.

In the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types.

INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

We glide over the desk piled with books about orchids, past a
photo of Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and
come to rest on a woman typing. It's Susan Orlean: pale,
delicate and blond. We lose ourselves in her melancholy
beauty. She turns to the camera and talks to us.

INT. RANGER'S TRUCK - MID-MORNING

Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee
Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the
white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license
plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers
into his C.B.

                    TONY
          We got a Seminole, or Seminoles, in the
          swamp. I'm on Janes Scenic Drive just
          east of Logging Road Twelve. I repeat,
          Indians in the swamp.

Tony waits for a response.   Nothing.

                    TONY (cont'd)
          Indians in the swamp.

Nothing still.   Tony clears his throat into the radio.

                    RADIO VOICE
          I don't know what you want me to say.

                    TONY
          Barry, Indians do not go on swamp walks.
          If there are Indians in the swamp, they
          are in there for a reason.

No response. Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches
the vehicles through binoculars. Nothing. He straightens
his cap. Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.

INT. L.A. BUSINESS LUNCH RESTAURANT - MIDDAY

Kaufman, wearing his purple sweater sans tags, sits with
Valerie, an attractive woman in wire-rim glasses. They pick
at salads. Kaufman steals glances at her lips, her hair, her
breasts. She looks up at him. He blanches, looks away.

                     KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I'm old.   I'm bald. I'm repulsive.

          Oh, thank you.

Valerie absently rubs her nose.      Kaufman self-consciously
rubs his nose in response.

                       VALERIE
             And we're thrilled you're interested.

Valerie rubs her nose again. Kaufman pulls at his nostril.
A rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead. Valerie watches
it. Kaufman sees her watching it. She sees him seeing her
watching it. She looks at her salad. He quickly swabs.

                       KAUFMAN
             Oh, thanks, wow. That's nice to hear.

                       VALERIE
             You have a really unique voice.

                       KAUFMAN
             Well, thanks. That's... I appreciate
             that.

             So --

Kaufman's brow is dripping again.      He smiles, embarrassed.

             Sort of hot in here.

             Yeah, it is a bit. So, why don't you
             tell me your thoughts on this crazy
             little project of ours.

In one motion, Kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book
entitled The Orchid Thief from his bag.

                    KAUFMAN
          First, I think it's a great book.

Kaufman nods, flips through the book, stalling. There's a
smiling author photo of Susan Orlean on the inside back
cover.

                    KAUFMAN
          And Orlean makes orchids so fascinating.
          Plus her musings on Florida, orchid
          poaching. Indians. Great, sprawling New
          Yorker stuff. I'd want to remain true to
          that, let the movie exist rather than be
          artificially plot driven.

                    VALERIE
          Okay, great, great. I guess I'm not
          exactly sure what that means.

                   KAUFMAN
          Oh. Well... I'm not sure exactly yet
          either. So... y'know, it's...

                         VALERIE
          Oh.    Okay.     Great.   So, um, what --

                    KAUFMAN
          It's just, I don't want to compromise by
          making it a Hollywood product. An orchid
          heist movie. Or changing the orchids
          into poppies and turning it into a movie
          about drug running. Y'know?

                    VALERIE
          Oh, of course. We agree.        Definitely.

                    KAUFMAN
          Or cramming in sex, or car chases, or
          guns. Or characters learning profound
          life lessons. Or characters growing or
          characters changing or characters
          learning to like each other or characters
          overcoming obstacles to succeed in the
          end. Y'know? Movie shit.

Kaufman is sweating like crazy now.       Valerie is quiet for a
moment.

                    VALERIE

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, THREE WEEKS EARLIER

The office is decorated with potted flowers, Audobon posters,
lots of books. Kaufman, nervous and sweaty, watches
Margaret, a soulful development executive, unpack boxes.

          wild flower. And after you learn all
          this stuff, you can teach me!

                    KAUFMAN
              (thrilled but controlled)
          That'd be fun.

                    MARGARET
          God, they're such beautiful flowers.    And
          so sexy. Y'know?
              (whispering)
          Did you know that orchid means --

                       KAUFMAN
          Testicle.     I just read that.

                    MARGARET
              (shrieks with delight)
          Testicle! Can you believe it!

Margaret giggles happily.    Kaufman giggles weirdly.

                    MARGARET (cont'd)
          I swear, it'd be fucking great for
          someone to have the testicles to make
          that book into a movie, man. Instead of
          this bullshit all the time. Something
          not about sex and violence and car chases
          and love stories, people learning
          profound lessons. Jesus, isn't nature
          enough?

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

Hot, dirty, miserable. Laroche leads the Indians through
waist-high black water. He points out a turtle on a rock.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

                    LAROCHE
          Pseudemys floridana. Did you fellas know
          you fellas believe the world rests on the
          back of a turtle? Not you fellas
          specifically. Although, maybe you fellas
          specifically. That I can't speak to.

The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots
something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He
stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe.

                        LAROCHE (cont'd)
                        Polyrrhiza Lindenii.
             A ghost.

The Indians come around. Laroche stares at a single
beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree.   He
tenderly caresses the petals. Then, business-like:

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Cut it down, Russell.

Russell pulls out a hacksaw, begins sawing through the tree.

INT. RESTAURANT - MIDDAY

Kaufman still sweats as he talks to Valerie.

                    KAUFMAN
          ...plus I love the idea of learning all
          about orchids. I really admire those
          guys who know everything about ants or
          fungus or whatever. I'd like to be more
          like that. See, I tend to write self-
          involved, self-loathing... even
          masturbatory stuff.
                    VALERIE
          And it's wonderful, by the way.

                    KAUFMAN
          Thanks. That's nice to hear. But I need
          to challenge myself as a writer. I've
          arrived at an age where I want to think
          about the world in a different way.

                    VALERIE
          Adapting someone else's work is certainly
          an opportunity to think differently.




                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    KAUFMAN
          Yes. And I welcome the challenge of
          taking a small subject, like orchids,
          something that would never draw people
          into a theater and making that
          fascinating. I want to show people
          heaven in a wildflower. As Blake wrote.

INT. PET STORE (1972) - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, TWENTY-SIX YEARS EARLIER

A serious ten year old boy walks from cage to aquarium,
studying the inhabitants. He turns to his frumpy mother,
who's been following at a respectful distance.

                    BOY
          Any one at all, ma?

She nods sweetly. The boy returns to his search.        He stops
at a small turtle in an aquarium.

                       BOY (cont'd)
             I want this then.

                    MOTHER
              (hugging him)
          A wonderful choice! And spiritually
          significant! Did you know that Native
          Americans believe the whole world rests
          on the back of a turtle?

                        BOY
             Cool!   I can't wait to tell the guys.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

As Laroche supervises, Randy, Russell, and Vinson saw through
tree branches supporting lovely flowering orchids. They
unceremoniously stuff the flowers into bulging pillowcases.

INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - EVENING

Kaufman eats with Margaret.     Margaret raises a glass.

                       MARGARET
             To a fucking awesome assignment, man.

Kaufman, pleased, clicks glasses.     He takes a breath.

                       KAUFMAN
             Hey, I'm going to an orchid show Sunday?
             For research? Maybe you'll come?

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               10.
CONTINUED:


                    MARGARET
          Absolutely. I think David, this guy I'm
          seeing, would enjoy it, too. He's a real
          naturalist. Okay if he comes along?

                    KAUFMAN
              (covering heartbreak)
          Yeah, of course. Sure.

                    MARGARET
          He wants to meet you anyway.     All I do is
          tell him how great you are.

                    KAUFMAN
          Oh, thanks. That's nice to hear.

                    MARGARET
          You'll like him. He's so honest and
          smart. It's rare to find someone in this
          town who thinks about things other than
          this fucking business, y'know?

                       KAUFMAN
          Yeah.     That's great.   He sounds great.

                       MARGARET
             Like the other day we were in bed
             discussing Hegel. Hegel! In bed! It
             was fucking amazing. Have you read much?

                       KAUFMAN
             Y'know, a long time ago.   A bit.   Y'know.

                       MARGARET
             Well, anyway, David and I were discussing
             his Philosophy of History and I was...

The entrees arrive.

                    MARGARET (cont'd)
          ... struck by his notion that history is
          a human construct...

Kaufman begins the laborious task of getting through his
plate of food. He can no longer look up at Margaret.

                        KAUFMAN
          Yeah.

                    MARGARET
          ... that nature doesn't exist
          historically, but rather cyclically.
                    (MORE)

          building upon itself, nature...

INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

Kaufman pulls a bunch of orchid books off the shelf, carries
them to the register, along with a book on Hegel, which
features an engraving of the philosopher on the cover.
Kaufman waits in line and watches the tattooed female cashier
flirting with the handsome guy ahead of him. He studies
their interaction, the way she looks at him. Her eyes, her
lips. The guy leaves and the cashier waves Kaufman over. As
she rings him up, she expresses no interest in him. He's
hurt and fixates on a sexy flower tattoo on her arm. She
catches him, pulls down her sleeve.

EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING

Tony waits, sweaty and mosquito bitten.   The radio crackles.

                    RADIO VOICE
          How's that Injun round-up going, Tony?

                    TONY
          Fuck you, Barry, you fuckin'...

Rustling near the parked cars. Tony tenses. Laroche steps
from the swamp with the Indians, who haul the pillowcases.

                    TONY (cont'd)
          We got poachers.
              (into the radio, pleased)
          We got fuckin' poachers, Barry.   Ha!

Tony jumps into the truck and turns it around.

INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Orlean types. Her delicate fingers move with a pianist's
grace across the computer keyboard.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.

EXT. TROPICAL RIVER - DAY

SUBTITLE: ORINOCO RIVER, ONE HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER

An overturned boat and uprooted orchids float on the river.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          The Victorian-era orchid hunter William
          Arnold drowned on a collecting
          expedition.

                                                            12.



EXT. CLIFF - DAY

SUBTITLE: SIERRA LEONE

A man lies at the bottom of a cliff, clutching a flower.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          Schroeder fell to his death.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

SUBTITLE: RIO HACHA

A man lies face down near an unplucked orchid.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          Endres was shot dead in Rio Hacha.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

SUBTITLE: YANGTZE RIVER

An emaciated, limping, wheezing man with a makeshift bandage
wrapped around his head, docks his boat.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          Augustus Margary survived toothache,
          rheumatism, pleurisy, and dysentery...

Someone steps from behind a bush, stabs him, steals his boat.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          ... only to be murdered when he completed
          his mission and traveled beyond Bhamo.

The murderer sails down river.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Laroche loved orchids but I came to
          believe he loved the difficulty and
          fatality of getting them almost as much
          as he loved the orchids themselves.

EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING

Tony steps out of his truck.   Laroche smiles warmly.

                    TONY
          Morning. May I ask what you gentlemen
          have in those pillowcases?

                    LAROCHE
          Yes, sir, you absolutely may.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Laroche goes back to directing the Indians.    Tony's confused.

                       TONY
             Okay, I'm asking then.

                    LAROCHE
          Oh, Okay then! Let's see...
              (peeking in bags)
          Five kinds of bromeliad, one peperomia,
          nine orchid varieties. About a hundred
          and thirty plants all told, which my
          colleagues have removed from the swamp.

                       TONY
             You're aware that it's illegal to remove
             plants or animals from state owned land?

                       LAROCHE
             And don't forget these plants are all
             endangered, sir. Every one of them.

                       TONY
             Exactly. Well, that's exactly the issue.
             This is a state preserve.

                       LAROCHE
             Yes, sir, it is.
                 (afterthought)
             Oh, and my colleagues are all Seminole
             Indians. Did I mention that? You're
             familiar, I'm sure, with the State of
             Florida v. James E. Billie.
Tony nods, even though he has no idea.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             So you know that even though Seminole
             Chief Billie killed a Florida panther,
             one of, what, forty in the entire world?

Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.       They give it.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          The state couldn't successfully prosecute
          him. Because he's an Indian and it's his
          right. As repugnant as you or I as white
          conservationists might find his actions.

                       TONY
          But --




                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                             14.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    LAROCHE
          Not to mention the failed attempts on
          three separate occasions to prosecute
          Seminoles for poaching palm fronds,
          which, I believe, they use to thatch the
          roofs of their traditional chickee huts.

Laroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation.

                    RUSSELL
          He's right. That's exactly what we use
          them for. Chickee huts.

Tony looks at the Indians.

                     RANDY
          Yeah.

                     VINSON
          Yeah.

                     RUSSELL
          Yeah.

                    TONY
          Yeah, but I don't... I can't let you
          fellas go yet. Just hold on while I...
              (into radio)
          Hey, Barry, can I get some help? Barry?

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

We watch Orlean as she drives out of the Miami Airport
parking lot, onto the freeway, past congestion and
billboards. Her mournful face glows beautifully,
dramatically with golden sunlight. She talks to us.

                    ORLEAN
          Nothing in Florida seems hard or
          permanent. The developed places are just
          little clearings in the jungle, but the
          jungle is unstoppably fertile, everything
          is always growing or expanding. At the
          same time, the wilderness disappears
          before your eyes.

Orlean gets quiet.   Her eyes tear.

EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY

SUBTITLE: AKRON, OHIO, THIRTY YEARS EARLIER

Lush color. A seven year old girl is gleeful as her parents
push her on a swing. She watches from the air as her mother
and father, deeply in love, kiss between pushes.

EXT. BIG SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE - DAY

Kaufman gets out of his car with his books. Two teenage
girls walk by. Kaufman watches as one whispers to the other.
He thinks he hears the word "Fatso." The girls giggle.

INT. EMPTY HOUSE - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

Kaufman passes a hall mirror, regards himself glumly, and
climbs the stairs.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I am fat. I am repulsive.   I cannot bear
          my own reflection.

At the landing Kaufman comes upon Donald, his identical twin
brother, on his back in pajama bottoms, opening a gift box.

                    DONALD
          Did you open your present from mom yet?

                    KAUFMAN
          What's with you?

                     DONALD
          My back.

Kaufman nods vaguely, continues down the hall. Donald pulls
a purple sweater from the box, calls after Kaufman.

                    DONALD (cont'd)
          Hey, Charles, you'll be glad, I have a
          plan to get me out of your house pronto.

                    KAUFMAN
          A job is a plan. Is your plan a job?

                    DONALD
              (big build up)
          I'm gonna be a screenwriter!   Like you!

Kaufman doesn't respond, enters his bedroom.

                    DONALD (cont'd)
          I know you think this is just one of my
          get-rich-quick schemes. But I'm doing it
          right this time. I'm taking a seminar!

                                                            16.



INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman lies face down on his mattress on the floor.

                    DONALD (O.S.)
          It's only five hundred bucks!

                    KAUFMAN
              (muffled by pillow)
          Screenwriting seminars are bullshit.

Kaufman pulls a copy of Variety, open to a photo of Margaret,
from under his pillow. He gets lost in the picture.

                    DONALD (O.S.)
          In theory I agree with you. But this one
          is highly regarded within the industry.

                    KAUFMAN
          Donald, don't say "industry."

Donald, now in the sweater, appears on all fours in the
doorway. Kaufman puts the paper back under his pillow.

                    DONALD
          I'm sorry, I forgot. Charles, this guy
          knows screenwriting. People from all
          over come to study his method. I'll pay
          you back, man. As soon as I sell --

                    KAUFMAN
          Let me explain something to you.

                    DONALD
          Yeah, okay.

                    KAUFMAN
          Anybody who says he's got "the answer" is
          going to attract desperate people. Be it
          in the world of religion --

                    DONALD
              (indicating his back)
          I just need to lie down while you explain
          this to me. Sorry. I apologize.
              (lies down, stares at ceiling)
          Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Okay. Go.

                    KAUFMAN
          There are no rules to follow, Donald, and
          anybody who says there are, is just --

          Not rules, principles. McKee writes:
          "A rule says, you must do it this way.   A
          principle says, this works... and has
          through all remembered time."

                    KAUFMAN
          The script I'm starting, it's about
          flowers. No one's ever done a movie
          about flowers before. So, there're no
          guidelines, and that's good because --

                    DONALD
          What about Flowers for Algernon?

                    KAUFMAN
          That's not about flowers.    And it's not a
          movie.

                    DONALD
          Oh, okay, I never saw it.    Go ahead.

                    KAUFMAN
          My point is, those teachers are dangerous
          if your goal is to do something new. And
          a writer should always have that goal.
          Writing is a journey into the unknown.
          It's not building a model airplane.

Donald stares at the ceiling, fuming. Kaufman waits.
Getting no no response, he pulls out his Hegel book and
reads:

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Each being is, because posited, an op-
          posited, a conditional and conditioning,
          the Understanding completes these its
          limitations by positing the opposite...

Kaufman's head is spinning. He puts the book down. Both
brothers stare at the ceiling. Donald finally speaks

                       DONALD
             McKee is a former Fulbright scholar. Are
             you a former Fulbright scholar, Charles?

INT. KITCHEN (1972) - EVENING

The young boy eats with his family. His father wears a
backbrace, his sister is weak and anemic. Only his sweet
mother pays attention as he chatters excitedly.

EXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING

Ranger, sheriff, and state police cars are parked near the
van and Ford. Lots of sweating, uniformed people. The
pillowcases have been emptied, the plants lie on black
plastic sheets. A guy sprinkles water on them. Laroche
enthusiastically helps Ranger Mike Owen catalogue the
flowers. The Indians lean against their car, bored and
smoking. Nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window.

                    LAROCHE
          ... and what we have here, my friend, is
          ... thirteen Encyclia Cochleata... four

          Coch-le-ata. Tem-pen-sis.
              (checks Owen's spelling)
          Okay, let's see, twenty-two Epidendrum
          Nocturnum. A very good haul. Two
          Catopsi Floribunda. Three Polyrrhiza
          Lindenii, the ghost orchid. What I
          really came for. These sweeties grow
          nowhere in the U.S. except in your swamp.

                    MIKE OWEN
          That true? Boy, you really know your
          plants, Mr. Laroche.

          foremost experts. But that'll all be
          revealed at the hearing.

INT. EMPTY DINING ROOM - DAY

Kaufman sits at a card table, picking at a salad and reading
an orchid book. Donald lies on the floor, chomping a hoagie
and reading a copy of Story by Robert McKee.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient
          family of perennial plants with...

Kaufman, bored, looks over at Donald, whose cheeks are
stuffed with food.

                    DONALD (V.O.)
          The most memorable, fascinating
          characters tend to have not only a
          conscious but an unconscious desire.
          Although these characters are unaware of
          their subconscious need...

                    KAUFMAN
          Maybe you should watch what you eat,
          Donald. Did you ever consider maybe
          you're a bit fat? Does it ever occur to
          you, you kind of represent me in the
          world? That people look at you and
          think, he's Charlie's twin, therefore
          that's what Charlie must look like?

                    DONALD
          By the way, mom's paying for the seminar.

                    KAUFMAN
          Did you even hear what I said?

                    DONALD
          Yeah. Anyway. I pitched mom my
          screenplay --

                    KAUFMAN
          Jesus, don't say "pitch."

                    DONALD
          Sorry. Anyway, she loved my... telling
          of my story to her. She said it's like
          "Silence of the Lambs" meets "Psycho."

                    KAUFMAN
          Hey, maybe you and mom could collaborate.
          I hear she's really good with structure.

                    DONALD
          You think you're so superior, Charles.
          Well, I'm really gonna write this. And
          you'll see. And, and... you suck, okay?

The two glare at each other.   They go back to their books.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Florida is a landscape of transition...

                    DONALD (V.O.)
          Do not proliferate characters; do not
          multiply locations. Rather than
          hopscotching through time, space, and
          people, discipline yourself to a
          reasonably contained cast and world...

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Orlean drives on State Road 29, past prefab housing, into
swampland. She talks to us.

                    ORLEAN
          Florida is a landscape of transition and
          mutation, a hybrid of unruliness and
          orderliness, nature and artifice.

She brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind
her small, pretty ear. We linger on the ear, which grows
pink with sunlight. Orlean catches us and smiles shyly.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY

Kaufman traces a stubby, nail-bitten finger along State Road
29 along a Florida road map. He turns to his typewriter, and
types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          We open on State Road 29. A lonely
          stretch of road cutting through untamed
          swampland. Suddenly a beat-up white van
          barrels around a curve. It's driver: a
          skinny man with no front teeth...

INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

The proceedings are in progress.   Orlean hurries in, sits in
the back.

Laroche, in a Miami Hurricanes cap, wrap-around Mylar
sunglasses, and a Hawaiian shirt, is on the stand. Alan
Lerner, the tribe's lawyer, questions him.

                    LERNER
          Finally, Mr. Laroche, what is your
          experience in the area of horticulture?

                    LAROCHE
          Okay, I've been a professional
          horticulturist for twelve years. I've
          owned a plant nursery of my own which was
          destroyed by the hurricane. I'm a
          professional plant lecturer. I've given
          at least sixty lectures on the
          cultivation of plants. I'm a published
          author, both in magazine and book form.
          I have extensive experience with orchids,
          and the asexual micropropagation of
          orchids under aseptic cultures.   This is
          laboratory work, not at all like your
          nursery work.
              (grins)
          I'm probably the smartest person I know.

                       LERNER
          Thank you.

                    LAROCHE
          You're very welcome.

INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

As she rings up his books, Kaufman admires the cashier's
flower tattoo. She catches him and smiles with red, wet,
pierced lips. She unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast
with a heart tattoo. A sweet heartbeat turns to knocking.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman, in bed masturbating, looks up at the closed door.

                       KAUFMAN
          What?!

The door opens.    Donald stands there for a moment in shadows.

                    DONALD
          Look, you wanna hear my pitch, or what?

                      KAUFMAN
          Go away.    God damn it.

          Y'know, I'm just trying to do something.

Kaufman squints at his brother, sits up, waits.

                    DONALD (CONT'D)
          Hey, thanks a lot, man. Cool.
              (flicks on light, then in pitch
               mode:)
          Okay, there's this serial killer, right --

Kaufman groans, lies down, pulls the covers over his face.

                    DONALD (CONT'D)
          No, wait. See, he's being hunted by a
          cop. And he's taunting the cop, right?
          Sending clues who his next victim is.
          He's already holding her hostage in his
          creepy basement. So the cop gets
          obsessed with figuring out her identity,
          and in the process he falls in love with
          her. Even though he's never even met
          her. She becomes, like, the
          unattainable, like the Holy Grail.

                       KAUFMAN
                 (through a blanket)
             It's a little obvious, don't you think?

                    DONALD
          Okay, but there's a twist. See, we find
          out the killer suffers from multiple
          personality disorder. Okay? See, he's
          really also the cop and the girl. All of
          them. It's all him! Isn't that crazy?

Donald waits, proud.    Kaufman pulls off the covers.

                    KAUFMAN
          Look, the only idea more overused than
          serial killers, is multiple personality.
          On top of that you explore the notion
          that cop and criminal are really two
          aspects of the same person. See every
          cop movie ever made for other examples of
          this.

                    DONALD
          Mom called it psychologically taut.

CONTINUED: (2)


                    KAUFMAN
          The other thing is, there's no way to
          write this. Did you consider that? I
          mean, how exactly would you show a
          character holding himself hostage?

                    DONALD
          Trick photography?

                    KAUFMAN
          Okay, that's not what I'm asking. What
          I'm asking is in the reality of this
          movie, if there's only one character,
          right?... Okay? How could you... What
          exactly would the scene... How...

Donald waits blankly.   Kaufman gives up, gets out of bed,
dresses.

                    KAUFMAN (cont'd)
          I agree with mom. Very taut. Sybil
          meets.. I dunno, something very taut.

Kaufman exits.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Orlean exits the courthouse and watches Laroche in a huddle
with Lerner, Vinson, and Buster Baxley, vice-president of the
tribe's business operations. They're all smoking intently.

                    LAROCHE
          They're gonna fucking crucify me.

                    BAXLEY
          I'll go into the Fakahatchee with a
          chainsaw. I swear to God.

                    LERNER
          Buster, for crying out loud, I reminded
          her the Indians used to own Fakahatchee.
          Look, we'll deal with all this at trial.

Buster waves a dismissive hand at Lerner, walks away. Vinson
shrugs, stubs his cigarette, follows Buster. Lerner and
Laroche stand there a moment. Lerner walks off. Laroche
cracks his neck. A charmingly shy Orlean approaches.

                    ORLEAN
          Mr. Laroche?

Orlean smiles, apologetic for the intrusion.

          New Yorker, yes, the New Yorker. Right?
                    ORLEAN
          Right. So I was interested in doing a
          piece about your situation down here.

Laroche scowls, smokes furiously, then, a test:

                    LAROCHE
          Yeah? Put this in: I don't care what
          goes on here. I'm right, and I'll take
          this all the way to the Supreme Court.
          That judge can screw herself.

Orlean scribbles on her pad. Laroche twists his head to see
that she's writing "Judge can screw herself."

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          That for real would go in?

Orlean nods.   Laroche smiles his toothless smile at Orlean.

EXT. FIELD - MORNING

MUSIC: lush, profound orchestral piece.

A glorious orange, large-petalled orchid blooms in dramatic
time-lapse. We slowly, lovingly circle the flower.

                    SENSUOUS FEMALE NARRATOR
          The Orchidaceae is a large, ancient
          family of perennial plants with one
          fertile stamen and a three petalled
          flower. In most orchid species, one petal
          is enlarged into a lip and is the most
          conspicuous part of the flower.

INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY

Kaufman, in a booth, reads his orchid book, takes notes.

orange hair, pouty lips, soulful eyes, and a voluptuous form
turning slowly around, scanning her station.

She sees Kaufman, approaches, and smiles warmly down at him.
Her badge reads: Alice, Arcadia, CA. Kaufman sweats.

                    ALICE
          So what looks good today?

                    KAUFMAN
          Um. Hi. Thank you. The key lime pie,
          please. A small slice. I'm watching
          my... And a coffee, please. Skim milk.

                    ALICE
              (sees book)
          Orchids! I absolutely love orchids.

He goes blank.

                     KAUFMAN
          Yes.   They're really great.

He flinches at his response.    A small awkward pause.

                    ALICE
          So, I'll be right back with your pie.

She smiles warmly again and leaves.    Kaufman is humiliated.

EXT. ORCHID SHOW - DAY

Alice the waitress and Kaufman walk hand-in-hand, inspecting
sexy orchids together. She smiles warmly at him.

                    ALICE
              (I love you)
          I absolutely love orchids.

INT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman finishes jerking off.   He lies lonely in the dark.

INT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - EVENING

Dark and muted. The seven year old girl is pushed on the
swing by her father. From the air she sees her mother, tiny
and lost, sitting across the yard smoking.

EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Orlean leans against a car and smokes. A tiny, lost figure.
There's a honk. Orlean snaps out of her reverie to see
Laroche screeching to a stop in his banged-up van.

                       LAROCHE
             I want you to know this van is a piece of
             shit. When I hit the jackpot, I'll buy
             myself an awesome car, maybe an Aurora.

Orlean nods, climbs in, and tries to rearrage some of the
junk on the front seat so she'll have a place to sit.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             Sit on top of that. You won't hurt it.

She situates herself on the seat.     Laroche lurches off.

INT. VAN - DAY

Laroche drives manically. Orlean watches the road and holds
one hand against the dashboard.

                       LAROCHE
             The thing you gotta know is my whole life
             is looking for a goddamn profitable
             plant. And that's the ghost.

                       ORLEAN
             Why the ghost orchid?

                       LAROCHE
             The sucker's rare. Collectors covet what
             is not available. I'm the only one in
             the world who knows how to cultivate it.

He looks at her and smiles. Orlean smiles back and
indicates, with a small jerk of the head, that he might want
to watch the road. He doesn't take the hint.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             The plan was, get the Indians to pull it
             from the swamp. I researched it. As
             long as I don't touch the plants, Florida
             can't touch us.   Then I'd clone hundreds
             of them babies in my lab, sell 'em, and
             make the Seminoles a shitload of change.


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                                27.

In handwriting made jerky by the bouncing van, Orlean writes
"shitload of change" on her notepad.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             And I stop future poaching by making the
             flowers readily available in stores.
             Then I give a big speech at the trial
             about how the legislature should get rid
             of loopholes smart people like me can
             find. I'm a hero. The flowers are
             saved. Laroche and nature win.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Old black and white footage, taken from up high, of two 19th
century men leading a horse drawn cart full of poached
orchids.

                       ORLEAN (V.O.)
             Men from Florida dominated the orchid
             hunting scene. Hunters in the
             Fakahatchee hauled out thousands of
             orchids in horse-drawn flatbed carts.

The camera swoops down, close to the men. As it does, the
image transforms. It turns to color, the men become
mannequins, the horse becomes papier-mache: it's a display.
A live man in modern work clothes is arranging actual orchids
in the cardboard cart.

INT. CAR - DAY

Kaufman drives slowly past Barnes and Noble, squints in the
window, sees the tattooed cashier. He passes Burger King,
sees a pretty employee, the same at Starbucks. Glassed-in
women on display, different types, different attitudes.
Kaufman stops in front of the California Pizza Kitchen.
Alice and her orange hair glow through the window. He
hesitates, then drives off.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING

Kaufman sits on the floor and types.

                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
             A beautiful orange orchid blooms in time-
             lapse --

Donald enters. Kaufman ignores him, continues typing.
Donald dawdles, picks up The Orchid Thief, flips through it.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          The camera circles it, revealing how
          lovely and perfect and sweet and inviting
          and delicate and...

                    DONALD
          Cool.

                    KAUFMAN
          What do you want, Donald?

                    DONALD
          Nothing. I just read about that Swamp
          Ape that supposedly lives in the swamp?
          Like bigfoot? You should put that in
          your script, like, killing people or
          something. That'd be very, very cool.

                    KAUFMAN
          Why are you in here now?

                    DONALD
          Nothing, I was just... Oh, one thing, I
          need a cool way to kill people. Don't
          worry! For my script! Ha ha!

Kaufman stares at Donald, rubs his eyes, then:

                    KAUFMAN
          Um, okay, killer's a literature professor
          who cuts off little chunks of his
          victims' bodies until they die. He'd be
          known in the tabloids as "The
          Deconstructionist."

                    DONALD
          That's kinda good.   I like that.

                    KAUFMAN
          See, I was kidding, Donald.

                    DONALD
          Oh, okay. Sorry. You got me! Heh-heh.
          Do you mind if I use it, though?

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM (1972) - NIGHT

There are now many turtles in aquariums. Many turtle books
and posters. The boy, in a turtle T-shirt, looks out the
window into the darkness. His eyes are troubled.

                                                            29.



INT. LIVING ROOM (1972) - CONTINUOUS

The boy comes downstairs. His father, in his backbrace,
watches TV; his sister lies on the couch, semi-conscious,
more pale than before. His mother pats the girl's head with
a damp cloth. There's a little Hindu altar with candles.

                    MOTHER
              (praying softly)
          For certain is death for the born/And
          certain is birth for the dead/Therefore
          over the inevitable/Thou shouldst not
          grieve. Sweet, sweet Diane.

The boy surveys the sad scene.    His mother looks up, smiles.

                    MOTHER (CONT'D)
          A slice of pie for my turtle expert?

The boy beams with pride, then gets solemn.

                    BOY
          Mom, there's something I feel I have to
          do. I don't know how to do this, but I
          feel in my stomach that I have to.

                    MOTHER
          What do you have to do, honey?

                     BOY
          Collect one of every turtle in the world.
              (beat)
          It's a long list, ma. Cuora
          galbinifrons, Graptemys versa, Callagur
          borneoensis, all the Galapagos species,
          people think there's only one, but that's
          hardly the case. Cycloderma frenatum,
          Cuora pani...
              (sighs)
          I don't think my life is worth living if
          I can't do this.

The boy and his mother look at each other.

                    MOTHER
          Well, we'd better get started, huh, baby?

The boy nods his head solemnly.

INT. VAN - DAY

Laroche drives, solemnly nodding his head. Orlean studies
him for a moment, her sad eyes wet and glistening.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                              30.

                       ORLEAN
             Wow, that's some story. So how many
             turtles did you end up collecting?

                       LAROCHE
                 (matter-of-fact)
             Oh, I lost interest right after that.

                       ORLEAN
             Oh.

                       LAROCHE
             I dropped turtles when I fell in love
             with Ice Age fossils. Learned everything
             about them. Collected the shit out of
             'em. Fossils were the only thing made
             any sense to me in this fucking world.
             Y'know?

They drive in silence.    Orlean watches a flying heron.

                       LAROCHE (CONT'D)
             Then fossils were over when I found
             lapidary, which I just adored.

                       ORLEAN
             Okay, now what is lap --

                       LAROCHE
             Ditched lapidary for resilvering old
             mirrors. Did that with my mom for a
             while. We had the largest collection of
             19th Century Dutch mirrors on the planet.
             Perhaps you read about us. Mirror World
             October '88? I have a copy somewhere...

Laroche fishes through junk as he drives.

                       ORLEAN
             So, did you ever miss the turtles? The
             only thing that made you ten year old
             life worth living?

                       LAROCHE
             I'll tell you a story. I once fell
             deeply, profoundly in love with tropical
             fish. I had sixty goddamn fish tanks in
             my house. I'd skin-dive to find just the
             right ones. Anisotremus virginicus,
             Holacanthus ciliaris, Chaetodon
             capistratus. You name it. Then one day
             I say, fuck fish. I renounce fish.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          I vow to never set foot in the ocean
          again, that's how much fuck fish. That
          was seventeen years ago and I have never
          since stuck so much as a toe into that
          ocean. And I love the ocean!

                       ORLEAN
              (beat)
          But why?

                    LAROCHE
              (shrugs)
          Done with fish.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman sits in silence across from his female therapist.

                       THERAPIST
          So --

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm still obsessed with that girl.

                    THERAPIST
          The Burger King girl? Dimples and sparkly
          eyes?

                    KAUFMAN
          California Pizza Kitchen.

                      THERAPIST
          Oh.    Red hair and nice?   Likes orchids?

                    KAUFMAN
          Yeah. She's really nice. I feel pretty
          certain she likes me maybe.

                    THERAPIST
          So do you think you'll talk to this one?

INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY

Kaufman, hair combed, sits nervously in a booth, watching
Alice. He tenses as she comes up to him. She smiles warmly.

                       KAUFMAN
          Hi!

                      ALICE
          Hey!    Some key lime pie for ya today?

            Okay, yeah! That sounds great!     Yeah!

                      ALICE
            I'll pick you out an extra large piece.
            Preferred customer.

She winks at him.   He's so in love.

                         KAUFMAN
            Thank you.     That's really sweet of you.

                      ALICE
            Still reading about orchids, I hope.

                      KAUFMAN
            Yes, I am, in fact!    Beautiful flowers.

                      ALICE
            A friend of mine has a pretty little pink
            one, grows right on a tree branch.

                      KAUFMAN
            That's what's called an epiphyte.

                      ALICE
                (pointing at him excitedly)
            Right! Boy, you know your stuff, huh?

                      KAUFMAN
            Not really. I'm just learning.
            Epiphytes grow on trees, but they're not
            parasites. They get all their
            nourishment from the air and rain.

                      ALICE
            Well, I'm impressed.    That's great.

Awkward pause.

                      KAUFMAN
            There are more than thirty thousand kinds
            of orchids in the world.

                      ALICE
            Wow, that's a lot, huh? Okay, then, so
            I'll be right back with a nice big slice
            of key lime pie for my orchid expert.

He beams.    She smiles and turns to leave.    Kaufman blurts:

                    KAUFMAN
          But, so, anyway, I was also wondering...

Alice turns back, still smiling.

                    KAUFMAN (cont'd)
          I'm going up to this orchid show on
          Saturday in Santa Barbara and I --

Alice's smile slips away.    Her warmth dissipates.

                    ALICE
          Oh, um, well --

                       KAUFMAN
          I'm sorry.     I apologize.   I'm sorry.

                    ALICE
              (nodding)
          So I'll be right back with your pie then.

He nods, watches Alice walk away and say something to another
waitress. The other waitress looks over at him. He sweats.

                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I am fat.     I am old. I am repulsive.

The other waitress brings his pie.      He smiles a thank you.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING

Orlean sits at her desk and talks to us.

                    ORLEAN
          There are more than thirty thousand known
          orchid species. One species looks like a
          German shepherd...

EXT. SANTA BARBARA ORCHID SHOW - DAY

Kaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts,
past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign. He tries to study
the flowers. They are dull. He forces himself to look.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          ... one looks like an onion, one looks
          like an octopus. One looks...

Kaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women:
all different shapes, colors, personalities, some in subtle
clothing, some in garish clothing, all glowing.



                                                      (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          ... like a school teacher, one looks like
          a gymnast, one looks like a Midwestern
          beauty queen, one looks like a New York
          intellectual with whom you'd do the
          Sunday Times crossword puzzle in bed.
          One looks like that girl in high school
          with creamy skin. One has eyes that
          dance. One has eyes that contain the
          sadness of the world.

He is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Nothing in science can account for the
          way some people feel about orchids.
          Those love them, love them madly.

One by one the women turn to the men they're with: a whisper
in the ear, a shared look, an arm slipped through an arm.
Kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Teenaged Laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp. He
carries a camera on a tripod. They spot a beautiful flower.
Laroche is in awe.

                       TEENAGED LAROCHE
             Encyclia tempensis. The butterfly.
Laroche sets up the tripod, focuses on the flower.    His
mother almost cries at the flower's beauty.

                    MOTHER
          "You will find something more in woods
          than in books. Trees and stones will
          teach you that which you can never learn
          from masters." Saint Bernard said that.

                    TEENAGED LAROCHE
          That's pretty, ma.

                    MOTHER
          Diane would've loved this flower, Johnny.

                    TEENAGED LAROCHE
          Maybe somehow she can see it.    Y'know?

                     MOTHER
              (beat)
          So... after this one how many, honey?

Laroche snaps the photo, makes a check in his notebook.

                    TEENAGED LAROCHE
          Only one hundred and seventeen more.

                    MOTHER
          And you have to have a photo of every
          single type of orchid in Florida?

                    TEENAGED LAROCHE
          I have to, ma. You know that.

She smiles at him, rubs his neck.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman talks to the therapist.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm successful, right? I mean, I could
          say to a woman, I'm a screenwriter and
          she'd look at me differently. I could
          get laid. But I want someone to like me.
          For me. Y'know?    The way I like them.
          The way I'd do anything for that woman
          walking down the street. A million women
          walking down the street. I don't need to
          know what their jobs are. No one will
          ever love me like that. Like I love
          almost every woman I see.

Kaufman glances down at his therapist's breasts. He does it
fast and unintentionally. He quickly shifts back to her
face. His therapist wraps her shawl around her.

INT. SHOW HALL - DAY

Crowded with orchid lovers. Noisy chatter and calliope
music. Elaborate displays include orchids on a ferris wheel,
plastic clowns, and a booth that looks like a circus big top.

                    LAROCHE
          Once you get the sickness, it takes over
          your life. I started out just
          photographing 'em. Now look at me.
              (dramatic pause)
          It'll happen to you. You'll see.

                    ORLEAN
          I don't think so.     I'm not prone to --

Laroche runs over to a flower.

           Angraecum sesquipedale! Beauty! God!
           Darwin wrote about this one. Charles
           Darwin? Evolution guy? Hello?

                     ORLEAN
               (annoyed)
           I know who Darwin is.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

A depressed Kaufman fishes on his floor through an ever
increasing pile of books: books about turtles, mirror
resilvering, tropical fish, Hegel, etc. He picks up The
Portable Darwin. The cover features a daguerreotype of
Darwin. Kaufman paces and reads.

INT. BOOK-LINED STUDY - NIGHT

SUBTITLE: ENGLAND, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS EARLIER

Sepia.   A sickly Darwin writes at his desk.

                     DARWIN (V.O.)
           Therefore I should infer from analogy
           that probably all the organic beings
           which have ever lived on this earth have
           descended from some one primordial form,
           into which life was first breathed.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman looks off into space, thinking. Silence. Suddenly,
he grabs his mini-recorder and paces like a caged animal.

                     KAUFMAN
           Okay, opening of movie. Four billion
           years ago. Life has not begun. Endless,
           barren terrain. Silence. Silence.

EXT. SHOW HALL - DAY

Blasting music.   Crowds.   Laroche shows the flower to Orlean.

                     LAROCHE
           See that nectary all the way down there?
           Darwin hypothesized a moth with a nose
           twelve inches long to pollinate it.
           Everyone thought he was a loon. Then,
           sure enough, they found this moth with a
           twelve inch proboscis -- proboscis means
           nose, by the way -- and --


                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              37.
CONTINUED:


                    ORLEAN
          I know what proboscis means.

                    LAROCHE
          Every one of these flowers has a specific
          relationship with the insect that
          pollinates it. There's an orchid that
          looks exactly like this particular
          insect. So the bug humps the flower and
          gets covered with its pollen. Thusly...

Laroche mimes humping.

                      ORLEAN
          I get it.

                    LAROCHE
          That's called pseudo-copulation. These
          flowers are smart! You gotta fall in
          love with them. Once you learn anything
          about orchids, you'll devote your life to
          learning everything about them.

Orlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals,
staring deep into nectaries. People jabber passionately,
people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants.
Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array
of colors and shapes, but remains detached.

INT. APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

Orlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board.
She can't find a way in. She looks over at her husband
reading. He smiles at her. She smiles back, but there's a
terrible distance between them. She looks at us sadly.

                    ORLEAN
          I wanted to want something as much as
          people wanted these plants but it isn't
          part of my constitution.

Orlean stares out the window at the empty street below.   A
plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze. She inhales.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          I suppose I do have one unembarrassed
          passion.
              (beat, looks back at us)
          I want to know how it feels to care about
          something passionately.

                                                            38.



EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - NIGHT

The seven year old girl swings sadly by herself. From high
up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house,
her father in a window at the other end. Both stare blankly
in opposite directions. The swing completes it's arc and the
girl descends, losing sight of her parents.

INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types furiously.   He's a sweaty mess.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          ... then, after the entire history of
          life on the planet, in the last seconds
          of the montage, we see the whole of human
          history: tool-making, hunting, farming,
          war, lust, religion, self-consciousness.
          Yearning. Then, bam! cut to Susan Orlean
          writing a book about orchids. And the
          story begins. It's perfect! It's
          circular! It's everything!

He reads back what he's written.

                    KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm an idiot. I'm fat. I hate my--

The front door bursts open and Donald charges in.

                    DONALD
          McKee is a genius! And hilarious! He
          just comes up with these great jokes, and
          everyone laughs! But he's serious, too.
          You'd love him. He's all for
          originality, just like you! But he says,
          we have to realize we all write in a
          genre, so we must find originality within
          that genre. See, it turns out there
          hasn't been a new genre since Fellini
          invented the mockumentary!

                    KAUFMAN
              (sadly, quietly)
          You and I share the same DNA. Is there
          anything more lonely than that?

INT. ORLEAN'S KITCHEN - EVENING

Orlean eats a silent dinner with her husband.

                    HUSBAND
          You want to do something tonight?

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            39.
CONTINUED:


                     ORLEAN
           I should work. I've got stuff...

He nods.   She smiles, picks up her dish, puts it in the sink.

INT. ORLEAN'S STUDY - EVENING

Orlean looks at the photo of Laroche, sits sadly for a
moment, then types.

                     ORLEAN (V.O.)
           Laroche is an optimist. That is, he sees
           a profitable outcome in every situation.
           When he was a young man he worked in
           construction.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, TEN YEARS EARLIER

A younger Laroche, in a hard hat, walks atop a half-built
house. He spots a flower in a backyard across the street.

                       LAROCHE
                 (pleased with himself)
             Asclepiadaceae. From thirty yards.   Yes.

He loses his footing, falls two storeys, lands on his back.

INT. DINER - DAY

Laroche talks.    Orlean takes notes.

                     LAROCHE
               (laughing)
           ... I broke my back. Exactly how my dad
           did. Isn't that a psycho coincidence?
               (far away)
           Y'know, the way I see it, we're a family
           of ailments and pain.
               (suddenly excited.)
           But, anyway, it was a godsend.

Laroche scarfs his pie.    Orlean watches him.

                      ORLEAN (V.O.)
           Laroche once spilled toxic pesticide into
           a cut on his hand. It resulted in
           permanent heart and liver damage. Most
           people would consider this a terrible
           accident. Laroche considered it a
           success...

                                                             40.



INT. SUBURBAN SUN ROOM - DAY

A prim woman reads a magazine article by Laroche entitled,
"Would You Die For Your Plants." There's a smiling photo of
a frail, emaciated Laroche next to his byline.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          ... because he sold an article about it.

INT. DINER - DAY

Laroche talks, mouth full of pie.    Orlean takes notes.

                    LAROCHE
          I consider the broken back -- in three
          places, by the way. I have x-rays --
              (fishes through bag)
          -- a stroke of goddamn luck. I got
          disability, married the sweetest woman in
          the world. And me and my lovely new wife
          -- my now ex-wife, the bitch -- got to
          open our nursery.

EXT. NURSERY - DAY

Laroche and his wife, in wedding clothes, stand outside their
nursery The Bromeliad Tree posing for an auto-timed photo.
Laroche wears a cumbersome back brace. The camera flashes.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types tentatively. Off-screen we hear Donald's
enthusiastic typing and giggling.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Movie opens with Susan Orlean typing.
              (refers to Orchid Thief)

          stick...

          Movie opens with...

Kaufman stops, scratches his head.    His hand is covered with
loose hairs. He whines.

INT. DINER - DAY

Laroche talks to Orlean.

                    LAROCHE
          People started coming out of the
          woodwork, to ask me stuff, to admire my
          plants, to admire me.

INT. THE BROMELIAD TREE - DAY

Lots of lonely-looking customers admiring orchids. Laroche
is in the midst of them, happily chatting with whomever
approaches him. One guy pulls Laroche aside.

                       CUSTOMER #1
             John, what is this? It's so beautiful.

                    LAROCHE
          Catasetum tenebrosum. From Peru. It's
          neat 'cause its dimorphic, which means...

Customer #2 enters with a creepy, dark flowered orchid.

                    CUSTOMER #2
          Johnny baby!

                    LAROCHE
          Henry! Look at that Dracula vampira!
          It's gorgeous, man.

Other customers gather around.

                    CUSTOMER #2
          Take me in to the Fakahatchee. Show me a
          ghost in bloom, and it's yours.

                       LAROCHE
          Cool.

                    CUSTOMER #3
          Mr. Laroche, would you be able to --

Laroche picks up a ringing phone. Customer #3 continues to
try and get his attention while he talks.

                    LAROCHE
          Bromeliad Tree. Hey, Dora! Good, good.
          Well, sure, you gotta watch the
          temperature. Don't want an odontoglossum
          above seventy-five. Uh-huh, that should
          be fine. Yeah, damp it down. Oh, I'm
          doing well. She's fine, too. Sure...

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Laroche drives.    Orlean looks out at the dark night.

                                                      (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    LAROCHE
          I believe some folks'd call me up to talk
          and just talk because they were lonely.

Orlean looks at him.     After a long silence, Laroche muses:

                     LAROCHE (cont'd)
          You know why I love plants? Because
          they're so mutable, so adaptable.
          Adaptation is such a profound process.
              (beat)
          Adaptation means you figure out how to
          survive in the world. People aren't too
          good at that sometimes.

INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman sits with his agent Jerry in a glass-walled office.

                       KAUFMAN
             I don't know how to adapt this. I
             should've just stuck with my own stuff.
             I don't know why I thought I could --

                        JERRY
             See her?   I fucked her up the ass.

Jerry waves at a passing beauty. She waves back, keeps
walking. Kaufman follows the girl's ass with his eyes.

                       JERRY
             Just kidding. Hey, maybe I can help.
             What's the problem, buddy?

Kaufman looks at Jerry.     Will he accept help from an agent?

                       KAUFMAN
             It's about flowers.

                       JERRY
             It's not only about flowers. It's got
             that crazy plant nut guy. He's funny,
             right?

Kaufman pulls out a folded newspaper clipping, reads:

                       KAUFMAN
             "There is not nearly enough of him to
             fill a book," blah blah blah, so Orlean
             "digresses in long passes" blah blah blah
             "no narrative really unites these
             passages." Blah blah blah blah blah.

          New York Times Book Review. I can't
          structure this. It's that sprawling New
          Yorker shit.

Jerry gets distracted by another sexy woman walking by.

                     JERRY
          Oh man.   I'd fuck her up the ass.

                    KAUFMAN
          There's no story. The book has no story.

                    JERRY
          So make one up. The book's a jumping off
          point. No one in town can make up a
          crazy story like you. You're the king.

                    KAUFMAN
          I didn't want to do that this time. It's
          someone else's material. I have a
          responsibility... Anyway, I wanted to
          grow as a writer, do something profound
          and simple. Show people how amazing
          flowers are.

                    JERRY
          Are they amazing?

                    KAUFMAN
          I don't know. I think they are.

                    JERRY
          Look, what I tell a lot of guys is pick
          another film and use it as a model. I
          always thought this one could be like
          Apocalypse Now. The journalist spends
          the whole movie searching for the crazy
          plant nut guy -- what's his name?

                    KAUFMAN
          John Laroche.

                    JERRY
          She has to travel deep into the darkest
          swamps to find the mysterious "Laroche."

                    KAUFMAN
          I need you to get me out of this.

                    JERRY
          Charlie, at the end of the day, I think
          it would be a terrible career move.

                                                          44.



MONTAGE

Jumble of images: Laroche talking, flowers, Indians, Orlean,
the trial. The rapid fire click-click of typing.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Okay, okay, we open with Laroche. He's
          funny. Okay, he says, okay, he says, I
          love to mutate plants, he says, mutation
          is fun... Okay, we show flowers and,
          okay, we have to have the court case.
          Okay we show Laroche, okay, he says, I
          was mutated as baby, that's why I'm so
          smart...that's funny. Okay we open at
          the beginning of time...no, okay, we open
          with Laroche driving into the swamp...

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman awakes with a start. Enthusiastic off-screen typing.
Kaufman peers through the darkness at the books, papers
coffee cups, and dirty plates all around.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Black and white. It's dark, tangled with foliage, and
foreboding. Two pioneers slog waist-high through the water.
Alligators regard them menacingly.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          The pioneer-adventurers in Florida had to
          travel inward, into a place as dark and
          dense as steel wool. They had to
          confront what a dark, dense, overabundant
          place might have hidden in it.

The scene turns into color. The men turn into mannequins.
The floor is covered with black cellophane representing swamp
water. The swamp turns to cardboard, with real orchids
hanging from the trees. A guy carrying some orchids walks on
top of the cellophane, past the mannequins.

INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark, lit only by the light of the TV Laroche's
father watches. Laroche and Orlean sit on the couch.

                    LAROCHE
          The nursery was going well, but sometimes
          bad things happen. Darkness descends.

                                                             45.

Laroche glances at his father, who just stares at the TV. On
the TV set are two framed photos: one of Laroche's sister and
one of Laroche's mother.

INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, NINE YEARS EARLIER

Laroche ushers his wife, mother, and uncle out of the house.
His father watches TV. There's only a photo of Laroche's
sister on the TV set now.

                    LAROCHE
          Sure you don't want to come, dad?

His father doesn't respond.

INT. LAROCHE'S CAR - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

They pile into a nice new American car, his wife in front,
his mother and uncle in back. Laroche pulls into traffic.

                    UNCLE JIM
          Nursery business good, Johnny?

                    LAROCHE
          Everything's good, Uncle Jim. This last
          year's been a dream, I'm telling you.
          We're finally pulling out of this debt.

                    MOTHER
          Amen, honey. Praise Allah, Buddha,
          Vishnu. And all the rest of 'em.

Laroche smiles back at his mother. A screech of tires and
another car crashes head on into theirs. Laroche's face
smacks against the steering wheel, his front teeth fly in all
directions. His mother rockets forward smashing through the
windshield. His uncle hits Laroche's wife in the head,
jerking her forward and landing on top of her.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Banged-up and missing his front teeth, Laroche stands amidst
a group of mourners at a double funeral.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Laroche, in his mourning suit, sits by his comatose wife.

                                                            46.



EXT. SEMINOLE DISCOUNT CIGARETTE STORE PARKING LOT - DAY

It's a busy street full of discount cigarette stores.
Laroche and Orlean step from his van, head toward the store.

                    LAROCHE
          She divorced me soon after she regained
          consciousness. Then the hurricane
          destroyed my greenhouse. Everything. I
          knew it would break my heart to start
          another nursery, so when the Seminoles
          wanted a white guy, an expert, to get
          their nursery going, I took it.

INT. DISCOUNT CIGARETTE STORE - CONTINUOUS

Laroche pulls about ten Marlboro cartons off the shelf.

                    LAROCHE
          But I wasn't gonna give them a
          conventional little potted-plant place.
          So I came up with the "ghost" plan.   I
          was gonna give them something amazing.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Kaufman, beer in hand, stands off in the corner of a room
crowded with young Hollywood types. He talks nervously to a
pretty young woman

                    KAUFMAN
          ... see, Laroche researched it and found
          that Indians have the legal right to take
          endangered plants off state lands.

                    WOMAN
          What an amazing opening! So then it's a
          courtroom drama. A Few Good Men! And
          all those Indian rights issues are so
          complex. There are valid arguments on
          both sides. I mean we took their land!
          We gave them smallpox!

                    KAUFMAN
          Well, actually, there wasn't much of a
          trial. Florida got 'em on a
          technicality, about cutting down non-
          endangered trees. Even the Indians
          aren't allowed to do that. They all
          plead no contest. Laroche got fined five
          hundred bucks and banned from the
          Fakahatchee for six months.

CONTINUED:


                        WOMAN
          Oh, wow.      So, like, then what happens?

                    KAUFMAN
          Nothing much. That's what I like. I
          mean, most people's lives don't include a
          lot of drama and I wanted to sort of be
          compelling without having to resort to
          big, um... Y'know what I mean?

                    WOMAN
              (glancing distractedly around)
          Absolutely. I absolutely do.

                    KAUFMAN
          It's, like, Blake talked about seeing the
          world in a grain of sand and heaven in a
          wild flower. Y'know? Or like Hegel?

The woman smiles, but she's somewhere else entirely.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - BEDROOM

Kaufman stares at his typewriter.        There's a big pile of
papers next to him.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I am a failure. I'm a poseur. I have no
          ideas. I wanted to do something great.
          There's no story. I'm fat. I'm repuls--

The phone rings.

                         KAUFMAN (CONT'D)
             What?

                        VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
             Charlie?   It's Valerie.

                         KAUFMAN
             Oh, hi.    Hi. Hey!   Hi!

                       VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
             Sorry to bug you. We were just talking
             about you, how excited we are.

                       KAUFMAN
             Yeah, me too.

                       VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
             So it's coming along good?



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               48.
CONTINUED:


                       KAUFMAN
             It's good. It's complicated what I'm
             trying to do, but it's going very well.

INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Orlean looks at a book called The Native Orchids of Florida.
She comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the
page. Orlean's husband walks by with a cup of coffee,
caresses her shoulder. She tenses slightly, smiles up at him
apologetically. He smiles back sadly. She returns to the
photo. A line of text catches her eye: "Should one be lucky
enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed." Orlean
closes the book, sits there. She dials the phone.

                       LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Yeah.

                    ORLEAN
          Hello, John? It's Susan.

                       LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Susie-Q!

                    ORLEAN
          So I was thinking it'd be good for the
          article for me to go into the Fakahatchee
          to see a ghost. Would you take me?

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          I'd love to, but, hey, I'm banned for the
          next six months. Goddamn crucified me.
          Get one of them monkey-suited rangers to
          take you. 'Course, they wouldn't be able
          to locate a ghost, if it climbed off a
          tree and shoved itself up their ass.
          Hey, put that in the article.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING

A hollow-eyed Kaufman is zipping up a suitcase.

                    KAUFMAN
              (calling off-screen)
          Travelling into the Fakahatchee, Donald,
          is a perfect metaphor for writing. I'm
          stepping into the confusion of the
          unknown. I'm taking the big risk here.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Donald types cheerily on a lap-top computer at an ergonomic
desk. Kaufman descends the stairs with his suitcase.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                    KAUFMAN
          It's dark, dangerous, as dense as steel
          wool. I don't know if I'll come out
          alive, but if I do, I'll have something
          true to give the world. That's the
          difference between writing and aping some
          moron's "principles."

Donald looks up from his work.      He hasn't been listening.

                       DONALD
             Hey, Charles, I'm thinking of putting a
             song in. Y'know like when characters
             sing pop songs in their pajamas and dance
             around. I thought it might be a nice way
             to break the tension. So, try to think
             of a song about split personality...

INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING

Orlean sits in her seat and addresses the camera.

                       ORLEAN
             You would have to want something very
             badly...

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Kaufman reads The Orchid Thief.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          ... to go looking for it in the
          Fakahatchee Strand.

He can't concentrate, closes the book and watches a
stewardess tending to another passenger.

INT. STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kaufman fixes a salad in the kitchenette. The door opens and
the stewardess enters dragging her luggage on a little cart.

                      KAUFMAN
          Hey!    How was Denver?

                    STEWARDESS
          Oh, God, sweetie, I'm so glad to be home.

She kisses him, looks lovingly at him.

                    STEWARDESS (cont'd)
          Can I get you something to drink?

                                                             50.



INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman finishes jerking off, stands, pulls up his pants,
adjusts himself, and exits the bathroom.

INT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman steps out of the bathroom. The stewardess is there
talking to another stewardess. She regards Kaufman blankly,
then goes back to her conversation. He heads up the aisle.
One of the stewardesses laughs. He tenses, takes his seat.

INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING

Orlean watches the hundreds of square miles of black, wet
Florida swampland pass by below.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          An early surveyor made this entry in his
          field notes...

SUBTITLE: FAKAHATCHEE, ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN YEARS EARLIER

A surveyor scribbles in a notebook.   The pond is alive with
alligators.

                    SURVEYOR (V.O.)
          A pond surrounded by bay and cypress
          swamp, impracticable. Full of monstrous
          alligators, counted fifty and stopped.

INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Orlean lies in bed, wide awake and anxious.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          Whatever isn't wet in the Fakahatchee is
          blasted. The grass gets so dry that the
          friction from a car can set it on fire,
          and the burning grass can engulf the car
          in flames. A 1940's botanist noted:

A car drives by on the dirt road. It begins smoking. The
driver jumps out of the car just as it bursts into flames.

We pull back to see the area filled with abandoned, burned-up
old cars.

INT. MIAMI AIRPORT CAR RENTAL BOOTH - DAY

Kaufman watches the pretty clerk working on the computer.
She looks up, he looks down, studies his road map.

INT. RENTAL CAR - EARLY MORNING

A charmingly bedraggled Orlean drives on a road surrounded by
swamp. She talks to us.

                    ORLEAN
          The swamp's darkness and denseness can
          rattle your nerves. A sailor on a pluma-
          collecting expedition wrote in his diary:

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

SUBTITLE: FAKAHATCHEE, ONE-HUNDRED AND THREE YEARS EARLIER

A luggish sailor sits in the distance on a stump, crying.

                    SAILOR (V.O.)
          The place looked wild and lonely. About
          three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's
          nerves. We saw him crying, he could not
          tell us why, he was just plain scared.

EXT. STATE ROAD 29 - EARLY MORNING

Orlean drives onto the dirt road past the Fakahatchee sign

EXT. RANGER SHACK - MORNING

Orlean gets out of the car, knocks timidly on the shack door.
Ranger Mike Owen answers.

                       MIKE OWEN
          Charlie?

It's Kaufman standing there.

                    KAUFMAN
              (tremulous)
          Yes. Hi.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

The sky is overcast. Mike Owen leads Kaufman through a cool
swamp, which is completely dry. The two men walk easily on
peaty ground. Kaufman, slathered with sun screen and covered
head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing, tries to be
interested in Owen's lecture.

                    MIKE OWEN
          So the whole ecosystem is six thousand
          years old. Five to six thousand years
          old. About that. Five or six.

                       KAUFMAN
          Okay.

                    MIKE OWEN
          Now the Fakahatchee is the largest of all
          the cyrpess strands, probably in the
          world. I don't know of any cypress
          strand bigger. It's about twenty miles
          long, or nineteen, nineteen to twenty,
          nineteen... and right here it's about
          five miles wide, four and a half, five.
          So, again, it's twenty miles long, three
          to five miles wide. And over here --

EXT. SWAMP - LATER

Mike Owen holds a handful of peat.   Kaufman looks at it.

                    MIKE OWEN
          The oldest carbon dating they've done on
          any of the peat out here is fifty-seven
          hundred years. That's with carbon-14.

                    MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
          That's in the right age where you can
          really date things accurately with carbon-
          14, because it's half-life is fifty-five
          hundred years, so they must have found
          have of it gone and figured that...

                       KAUFMAN
             Why isn't it wet? Orlean wrote about
             wading through black, corrosive water.
             She said it was the scariest experience
             of her life. And when I spoke to you on
             the phone, you said wear heavy boots,
             long pants and...

                    MIKE OWEN
          There's usually water. We've been going
          through a bit of a drought. Say, have
          you seen that movie, Medicine Man?
          That's a good movie about protecting
          nature. It shows there could be
          something important in a rain forest we
          don't even know about, like a cure for
          cancer.

                    KAUFMAN
          It's not even hot. I was expecting it to
          be awful. Sun beating down, wading
          through water, looking out for snakes,
          wild hogs. I was thinking it would be
          dramatic. Alligators. Something!

                     MIKE OWEN
          The alligators are over by the lakes.
          The temperature's a blessing for us.
          This time of year can get uncomfortably
          hot.
               (pointing excitedly)
          Green anole. Florida's most common.

Kaufman looks down and sees a plain-looking little lizard
hanging on a tree. Mike Owen jots it down in his notebook.

                    MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
          I try to keep a log of sightings.

INT. TRUCK - DAY

Mike Owen drives.    Kaufman stares out the window at boring
trees.

          It had been a hard day and I hadn't seen
          what I'd come to see. Maybe the ghost
          orchid was a ghost after all.

          There are certainly ghosts in the
          Fakahatchee -- ghosts of rangers who were
          murdered years ago by illegal plume
          hunters, and of loggers who were cut to
          pieces in fights, and for years there has
          been an apparition wandering the swamp,
          the Swamp Ape, which is said to be seven
          feet tall and seven hundred pounds and
          have the physique of a human, the posture
          of an ape, and the body odor of a skunk.

          What Laroche did was wrong. Those
          flowers belong to all of us, all 250
          million of us -- 250? I think it's up to
          270 now -- And belonging to all of us
          means they belong to none of us. Nobody
          has a right to take them. Not me, not
          you, not John Laroche, not...

Kaufman is desperate for something else.    He blurts:

                    KAUFMAN
          Listen, um, Susan Orlean wrote about a
          legendary creature called a Swamp Ape.
          Have you ever heard stories or --

                    MIKE OWEN
              (pissy)
          Tourist garbage! I don't know why people
          need to invent silly creatures to make
          nature fascinating. Isn't nature amazing
          enough?

                    KAUFMAN
              (shamed)
          I just asked because she mentioned it.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean, still dirty from the swamp, holds a phone to her ear
and talks to us. She has cute little dirt smudges on her
face.

                    ORLEAN
          That night I called Laroche.

                       ORLEAN
                 (into phone)
             I didn't see anything but bare roots.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          And I had this thought. Maybe the ghost
          orchid only blooms in the minds of people
          who've walked too long in the swamp.

INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Orlean types. It's pouring and sheets of rain beat against
her window. She glances at her husband, across the room
reading a book. She sighs, continues typing.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          What I didn't say to him is that life
          seemed to be filled with things that were
          just like the ghost orchid -- wonderful
          to imagine and easy to fall in love with
          but a little fantastic and fleeting and
          out of reach.

INT. RENTAL CAR - EVENING

Kaufman drives down a Florida strip-malled highway. He
passes a Barnes and Noble, a Burger King, a Starbucks. He
parks in front of a California Pizza Kitchen.

INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN (FLORIDA) - EVENING

Kaufman watches the waitresses. One approaches his booth.
Her name badge reads: Caryn, Tampa, FL. She smiles at
Kaufman as she looks right through him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A morose Kaufman sits on the bed reading The Orchid Thief.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          What I didn't say to him was that life
          seemed to be filled with things that were

          to imagine and easy to fall in love with
          but a little fantastic and fleeting and
          out of reach.

Kaufman is deeply moved. He hi-lites the passage, then looks
at the smiling photo of Orlean. He finds himself lost in it.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean, dirty from the swamp, is on the phone.

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
              (beat,clears throat)

          Beautifully written. A really unique
          piece.

PULL BACK TO:

INT. RESTAURANT - MIDDAY

Busy lunch crowd. Valerie sits at a table with Orlean and an
open New Yorker magazine.

                        ORLEAN
          Thank you.      Thanks very much.

                    VALERIE
          We're big fans.

                    ORLEAN
          Oh, thank you.

                    VALERIE
          And Laroche is such a fun character.

                    ORLEAN
          Yeah, John's a character all right.

                    VALERIE
          It's funny and fresh.     And sad in a way.

                    ORLEAN
          Well, thanks. Thank you.

                    VALERIE
          So we were wondering, what's next?

                    ORLEAN
          Oh, um, Random House wants me to expand
          it into a book. So I'll be doing that.

                    VALERIE
          And there'll be more of Laroche?

                        ORLEAN
             Yeah.   More John, more orchids.

              (laughing)
          You want to make this into a movie?

                    VALERIE
          Laroche is such a fun character.   So...

INT. VAN - DAY

Laroche, wearing a Cleveland Indians T-shirt, drives crazily
thorugh the Hollywood Seminole reservation. Orlean holds on.

                     LAROCHE
          No shit I'm a fun character.
              (beat)
          Who's gonna play me?

                    ORLEAN
          I've got to write it first. Someone's
          gotta write the screenplay. Most things
          never get made. It's premature to --

                    LAROCHE
          I think I should play me.

Laroche swerves into a parking space in the nursery lot.

EXT. SEMINOLE NURSERY   - DAY

Laroche and Orlean get out of the van.

                    LAROCHE
          I've got all the right qualities. While
          you write, I'll take an acting class.

A few young Indian guys are hauling bags of potting soil.
They look at Laroche sourly. Laroche indicates the giant
cartoon Indian on his T-shirt.

                    LAROCHE
          I wear this just to screw with 'em.

INT. TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

Laroche enters his office, looks at some papers on his desk.

                    LAROCHE
          Most of them don't even bother calling me
          John anymore. It's "Crazy White Man"
          now.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          "Crazy White Man" is a good title for the
          movie. Call the book "Crazy White Man."
          Or, I don't know, "Collector of Hearts"
          or something.

Before Orlean can respond, Laroche picks up the phone and
dials an impossibly long number. He waits, gestures for
Orlean to sit on a chair piled high with junk.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          You won't hurt anything.

Orlean moves the junk over, shares the seat with it.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
              (Yelling into phone)
          Hello? Hello? Hi? This is John Laroche
          from the Seminole Nursery. Sem-ih-nole!
              (to Orlean)
          How do you say Seminole in Spanish?
              (into phone)
          That's right, yes! Yeah, I want to order
          some more of those pink string beans!
          Pink string beans!
              (yelling)
          Pink String Beans! Pink String Beans!

Buster appears in the door.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
              (into phone)
          I'll call back.

          Hey, Buster.

          John.

                    LAROCHE
          I was trying to order some pink string
          beans from Argentina.

                    BAXLEY
          No kidding.

                    LAROCHE
          I figure just because Project Ghost
          Orchid is dead, we're not closing shop.

                    BAXLEY
          Listen, John --

          We'll get into plant multiplication. Buy
          little ones, turn 'em into big ones, sell
          'em at a profit. Simple plant
          multiplication for the masses.

                    BAXLEY
          John, we're thinking maybe now's a good
          time for you to take a few weeks.

                    LAROCHE
          I don't need a vacation, Buster.

                    BAXLEY
          It's a good time.   Things are slow.

Laroche stares at Buster.   Buster stares back.

                    LAROCHE
          Y'know, the guys on my crew here, all
          they do is smoke weed all day. I been
          meaning to talk to you about that. So if
          it's a question of productivity --

INT. VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Laroche weaves through traffic.   Orlean holds on.

                    LAROCHE
          They're gonna fire me. Goddamn politics.
          Crazy White Man's bad publicity.
              (pounds steering wheel)
          I can't believe I'm dealing with this!
              (pounds steering wheel)
          Like I could give a damn. If they fire
          me, I'll sue. I already did some legal
          research on this when I was doing the
          other shit. They can't fire me. And I
          ain't going to quit.

MONTAGE

Gray skies. Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the
Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's
house. He drives through swampy terrain. He walks around at
an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture. It's
all dull. He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach,
staring out at the ocean.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Orlean dials the phone.   It rings for a long time.    Finally:


                                                      (CONTINUED)

          John, it's Susan.
              (waits for response)
          Orlean.
              (waits)
          So, I was just wondering if you might be
          willing to talk some more.

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          What about?

Orlean rolls her eyes.

                    ORLEAN
          C'mon, John, I'm trying to put together a
          book. Don't just abandon me down here.

                    LAROCHE
          I'm no longer interested in orchids. I'm
          pursuing other avenues. I apologize for
          any inconvenience this might cause you.

Orlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table.

                    LAROCHE
          Thank you for your time.

Laroche hangs up. Orlean sits there for a moment, flips
through her list of orchid collector names.

EXT. EMPTY BEACH - DAY

Kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. An
attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German.
He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. He
doesn't get it. They're gone. A tan older man sits on the
bench, lights a cigarette. Kaufman continues to look at the
ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. He
doesn't want to engage.

                    GUY ON BENCH
          We could use the rain, huh?

Kaufman nods, looking at the ocean.      Pause.

                    GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)
          So you from around here?

Kaufman shakes his head "no."   Pause.

          California.

                     GUY ON BENCH
              (excitedly)
          Yeah? I'm moving to L.A. I just wrote a
          screenplay. I sent it to a lot of
          agents. But if they turn me down, I'll
          go there and market it myself. I used to
          be in marketing in New York, so I know
          exactly how to sell this thing.
              (beat)
          Where's a nice place to live if you don't
          have a car?

                    KAUFMAN
          You kind of need a car. I guess West
          Hollywood would be okay.

                    GUY ON BENCH
          So you recommend West Hollywood then.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm not recommending it.

Pause.

                    GUY ON BENCH
          I moved down here for a change, and I
          wrote the screenplay. Just like that.
          It's a great idea.

The old guy waits for a response.    He gets none.

                    GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)
          It's about a mob guy, but it's not your
          regular mob story. There's a twist. A
          cop tells this mob guy's wife that the
          mob guy's cheating on her. But the truth
          is, the cop's lying because he wants her
          for himself. See, they used to go
          together in high school.
              (waits for response, then:)
          You know anything about screenplays?

Kaufman shakes his head.

          twist it to keep 'em surprised. I came up
          with all these amazing twists out of
          nowhere. Well, not nowhere.

                    GUY ON BENCH
          You don't believe in anything?

Kaufman shrugs.

                    GUY ON BENCH (cont'd)
          I don't know how you can look out at this
          beautiful ocean and not believe there's
          an intelligence that created it.

                    KAUFMAN
          I don't know.

                    GUY ON BENCH
          Well, you can't know until you experience
          it. That requires accepting Jesus Christ
          as your Lord and Savior. Believe me.
          Lookit, if I was to show you a bottle of
          clear liquid and told you it was vodka,
          how would you know if it really was or if
          it was water? There's only one way.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'd smell it.

                    GUY ON BENCH
              (annoyed)
          No. You can't smell vodka.    You'd have
          to taste it, right?

                    KAUFMAN
          It could be poison.    I don't know you.

                    GUY ON BENCH
              (angry)
          Look, let's go with the analogy I'm
          drawing here. It's not poison. Okay?

                    KAUFMAN
          Right.

                     GUY ON BENCH
          That's all I'm saying.
              (beat)
          So West Hollywood, huh? I think I'll

nurseries, sits in lecture halls, attends orchid shows, sits
in the library reading orchid books. She is bored and
distracted.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

A stewardess places a cup and an airline-sized bottle of
vodka down in front of a lost Kaufman. He smiles at her.    No
response. He opens the bottle and smells the vodka.

INT. LIMO - NIGHT

Kaufman sits in the back seat and stares out the window. The
driver looks at him a couple of times in his rearview mirror.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I have failed. I have nothing to say.    I
          am fat. I am not a writer.

                    DRIVER
          Mr. Kaufman, do you mind if I ask what
          type of work you do for Sony?

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm a writer.

                    DRIVER
              (impressed)
          A song writer?

                    KAUFMAN
          No, I'm a screenwriter.

                    DRIVER
          Oh, wow! Good for you. You mind if I
          ask what your movie's about?



                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             64.

                    KAUFMAN
          It's about flowers.

No response.   Kaufman tries to make it interesting.

                    KAUFMAN (cont'd)
          It's about this poacher who steals
          orchids out of a swamp.

                    DRIVER
          I heard about that!   Drug flowers, right?

                     KAUFMAN
          Yeah.   That's it.

                    DRIVER
          I heard about that! That's great!
          Action-adventure is my favorite genre.

INT. EMPTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Kaufman enters with his bags and heads to the stairs.
Donald, typing furiously at his desk, looks up.

                    DONALD
          How was Florida, man?

                    KAUFMAN
              (climbing the stairs)
          Okay.

                    DONALD
          Cool! Hey, my script's going amazing!
          Right now I'm working out an Image
          System. Bob calls it an invaluable
          asset. Because of my multiple
          personality theme, I've chosen the motif
          of broken mirrors to show my
          protagonist's fragmented self. Bob
          teaches that an Image System greatly
          increases the complexity of an aesthetic
          emotion.

                    KAUFMAN
          You sound like you're in a cult.

Kaufman disappears upstairs.

                    DONALD
          No, it's just good writing technique.
              (types, then:)
                    (MORE)


                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
                    DONALD (cont'd)
          Oh, I made you a copy of McKee's Ten
          Commandments. I've posted one over both
          our work areas.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman tears down MCKEE'S TEN COMMANDMENTS. Donald appears
backlit in the doorway and seems oddly threatening.

                    DONALD
          You shouldn't have done that.

They look at each other.    Donald breaks the tension, smiles.

                    DONALD (cont'd)
          'Cause it's extremely helpful.
              (lies down on floor)
          Hey, any sign of that Swamp Ape?

                       KAUFMAN
             There is no Swamp Ape. It was invented
             for people who can't find the actual
             world fascinating. Y'know?

                    DONALD
          Oh, okay. I didn't know that. Sorry.
          Hey, I got a song! "Happy Together." I
          was worried about putting a song in a
          thriller, but Bob says, Casablanca, the
          greatest screenplay ever written, did
          exactly that. Mixed genres.

                    KAUFMAN
          I need to go to bed, Donald.    I haven't
          slept in a week.

                       DONALD
          Okay.

Donald remains on the floor.

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

Mishmash of images: alligators snapping, Laroche jabbering,
Orlean typing, 19th century orchid poachers slogging, orchids
blooming, Mike Owen lecturing.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          ... so we open the swamp... okay,
          flashback to young Laroche had turtles...
          Okay, Susan says What Is Passion? And
          okay we open on a swamp and suddenly a
          white van comes tearing around...

                                                             66.



INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman lies half-awake in bed, sweating, his eyes darting
back and forth. He looks over at the clock. It's 3:32.

                     KAUFMAN
          Damn it.

Donald snores happily off-screen.   Kaufman switches on a
lamp, pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag, flips through it.
There are now many yellow hi-lited passages. He reads one.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          There are too many ideas and things and
          people, too many directions to go. I was
          starting to believe the reason it matters
          to care passionately about something is
          that it whittles the world down to a more
          manageable size.

                    KAUFMAN
          Such sweet, sad insights.   So true.

Kaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo.

                    KAUFMAN
          And you're... I like looking at you.

He stares at the photo.   Its smile broadens.    It talks.

                    ORLEAN PHOTO
          I like looking at you, too.   Charlie.

The photo smiles warmly at him.   Kaufman begins to jerk-off.
He closes his eyes.

Then: Kaufman and Orlean are in his bed together, making
love. She smiles at him throughout. They finish.

Then: Kaufman is alone in bed, heaving. He looks at the
still smiling photo. It somehow seems sleepy now.

                    KAUFMAN
          I don't know how to do this. I'm afraid
          I'll disappoint you. You've written a
          beautiful book. I can't sleep. I'm
          losing my hair. I'm fat and repulsive --

                    ORLEAN PHOTO
          Shhh. You're not. Whittle it down,
          focus on one thing in the story, find the
          thing you care passionately about and
          write about that.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              67.

Kaufman studies her delicate, melancholy face.      He's in love.

                    ORLEAN PHOTO (cont'd)
              (sweet, flirty smile)
          I figured there might be something...

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Kaufman paces and talks animatedly into his mini-recorder.

                    KAUFMAN
          We see Susan Orlean, delicate, fragile,
          beautiful, haunted by loneliness, typing
          at her desk. She looks at the camera and
          talks to us: "John Laroche is a tall guy,
          skinny as a stick, pale-eyed, slouch-
          shouldered..."

Donald enters in his underwear, pours coffee.

                       DONALD
          Morning.

                       KAUFMAN
          Hey, hey.

                    DONALD
          You seem chipper.

                       KAUFMAN
          I'm good.     I have some new ideas.

                    DONALD
          Cool. Me too. I'm putting in a chase
          sequence now. The killer flees on
          horseback with the girl. The cop is
          after them on a motorcycle. It's like a
          battle between motors and horses.

                       KAUFMAN
             They're all still one person, right?

                       DONALD
             Yeah, hey, that's the big pay-off.

                     KAUFMAN
              (nice)
          Well, it sounds exciting.

                    DONALD
          Thanks, man. Thanks.

                                                             68.



INT. CAR - DAY

Orlean drives through swampy landscape.   She talks to us.


                    ORLEAN
          I suppose what I'd been doing in Florida
          was trying to understand how people found
          order and contentment and a sense of
          purpose in the universe by fixing their
          sighs on one single desire. Now I was
          also trying to understand how someone
          could end such intense desire without a
          trace.

Orlean stops at a payphone and dials.   It rings for a while.

                     LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
              (groggy)
          Yeah what?

                    ORLEAN
          Hello, John, it's Susan.

                     LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Yeah hi.

                    ORLEAN
          So, how's everything going?

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Great! I'm training myself on the
          internet. It's fascinating. I'm doing
          pornography. It's amazing how much these
          suckers will pay for photographs of
          chicks. And it doesn't matter if they're
          fat or ugly or what.

                    ORLEAN
          That sounds good.

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          It's great is what it is.

                    ORLEAN
          So I've been meeting a lot of orchid
          people, going to shows, I thought you
          might want to hear about it.

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Sorry. I am officially no longer
          interested in orchids or the losers who
          are still interested in them. The end.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                            69.
CONTINUED:


Laroche hangs up.   Orlean looks off into the flat distance.

                    ORLEAN
          If you really loved something, wouldn't a
          little of it always linger?

She turns to the camera.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman holds The Orchid Thief open with one hand and types
with the other.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Susan Orlean drives. The golden light of
          the afternoon sun caresses her sweet
          face. She talks to us.
              (copying from book)
          "Florida is a landscape of transition and
          mutation, a hybrid of ..."

Kaufman's hand slips, the book shuts. He opens it to the
wrong page and sees an About The Author paragraph. The last
line jumps off the page: "She now lives in New York City with
her husband."

EXT. L.A. STREET - NIGHT

Kaufman wanders the street, distraught.   A passing woman
snickers.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Susan and her husband eat dinner in
          silence. A dying relationship. Husband:
          You want to do something tonight? Susan:
          I should work. Y'know. I got stuff...

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - DAY

Kaufman and Orlean move furniture into the room. It now
looks warm and inviting. Orlean wears a bandana kerchief.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm so thrilled I get to adapt your book,
          get to merge my thoughts with yours. I
          love that. It's intimate, like a
          marriage.



                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              70.
CONTINUED:


                    ORLEAN
          Not like a marriage.

                    KAUFMAN
          Maybe what marriage could be.

Her eyes tear up.    She kisses him.

                    ORLEAN
          Isn't it ironic? You adapting my book?
          My three years in Florida meditating on
          my inability to experience passion
          resulted in my finding it with you.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING

Kaufman paces with his mini-recorder.    Off-screen typing.

                    KAUFMAN
          ... and in the final sequence Susan as a
          young girl swings alone in the backyard.
          From high in the air she sees her parents
          in separate rooms staring blankly in
          opposite directions. This symbolizes the
          profound scarring their waning passion
          has had on the girl's psyche, how she
          became afraid to ever really love
          something because it would go away.

Kaufman is immensely pleased.    He smiles at Orlean's photo.

                    KAUFMAN (cont'd)
          This is good. I'm finding you.

The phone rings.

                       KAUFMAN
          Yallo?

                    VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
          Hi, Charlie. It's Valerie. Just bugging
          you again. How's everything going?

                       KAUFMAN
          Good.     I think really good now.

                      VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
          Great.    So I spoke to Susan yesterday.

                     KAUFMAN
              (beat)
          Oh. Uh-huh, uh-huh.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              71.
CONTINUED:


                    VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
          I told her you were making terrific
          progress and she's really excited to read
          the script.

Sweat appears on Kaufman's brow.

                        KAUFMAN
          Oh.   Good.

                    VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
          And she said she'd love to meet you.

All color drains from Kaufman's face.

                    KAUFMAN
          Um, well, y'know, for me it's distracting
          to... or confusing to discuss what I'm
          exploring in the screenplay at this
          point... before I finish... it. So...

                    VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
          That's fair. I'll let her know.

                    KAUFMAN
          Tell Susan I'd be very happy to meet her
          at a future date. As she sees fit.

                     VALERIE (PHONE VOICE)
          Okay.   Good enough.

                    KAUFMAN
          And tell her how much I love her book.
          Say I think she's such a great writer.

                     VALERIE (cont'd)
          Will do.   Just keep us posted, Charlie.

                     KAUFMAN
          Okay.   Nice talking to you.   Okay then.

Kaufman hangs up and looks at the photo of Orlean. It's
still smiling, but not at him. It's not glowing. Maybe it's
even smirking. Kaufman paces frantically, holding his
stomach. Donald's off-screen typing grows louder.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Donald types at his desk on his computer.    Kaufman storms in.

                    KAUFMAN
          You can sit here and pretend to be a
          writer, mocking the seriousness of what I
          do, like some kind of fucking funhouse
          mirror version of me! But let me tell
          you, you don't know what writing is!

Kaufman grabs his stomach, doubles over.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Kaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an IV. He watches a
slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a
small room across the hall. She glances over in his
direction. He smiles. She looks through him.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          She thinks I'm repulsive.

He lies there for a moment, then his eyes light up.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY

Kaufman types passionately on his computer.

                     KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Movie opens.: Charlie Kaufman, fat, old,
          bald, paces the room. His voice-over
          carpets the scene. "I am old. I am fat.
          I am bald. My toenails have turned
          strange. I am repulsive. How repulsive?
          I don't know for I suffer from a
          condition called Body Dysmorphic
          Disorder."

INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman, looking tired and wild-eyed, sits with his agent.

                    JERRY
          ... we need to talk about the orchid
          script. Valerie called yesterday.
          They're getting antsy.

                    KAUFMAN
          I think I've got it on track now.

                     JERRY
          Good.   She said you sounded weird.

                    KAUFMAN
          No Hollywood bullshit. Just raw truth.
          Sometimes that takes a while to find.

          Okay.    What's the time frame here?

                    KAUFMAN
          It's goddamned honest, Jerry.   It's true.

                    JERRY
          Oh, hey, my friend sent me this fucked-
          up internet thing. It's a girl taking a
          shit, but a trout comes out. You got e-
          mail yet? I'll send it to you.

                    KAUFMAN
          This is more honest than anything
          anyone's ever done before in a movie,
          I'll tell you that. The only truth we
          can offer is the truth that's our own
          experience of the world. "The great
          poet, in writing himself, writes his
          time." T.S. Eliot.

                    JERRY
          It sounds good, buddy. But we do need to
          give Valerie a ballpark --

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm sick of their constant harassment!

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Black and white shot of Laroche and the Indians slogging
through Fakahatchee. The camera swoops down and the scene
turns into a mannequin version.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          On December 21, 1993 John Laroche and
          three Seminoles illegally removed one
          hundred and thirty rare plants from the
          Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve.

INT. MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

It's an enormous hall filled with people setting up elaborate
displays.   Martin Motes and his assistant work on the
Laroche display. Orlean watches them. Motes looks up.

                    MOTES
          You've been checking out the displays?

                      ORLEAN
          Yeah.

          It's the Miami centennial, we're supposed
          to illustrate something about Florida
          history.

                   ORLEAN
          Right. Now Laroche is part of Florida
          history. As a mannequin.

                    MOTES
          It's a world of words to the end of
          it./In which nothing solid is its solid
          self. You'll have to forgive me, I'm a
          reformed poetry professor.

Orlean is moved by the quote.

                    ORLEAN
          Who is that?

                    MOTES
          Wallace Stevens.

INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - NIGHT

Orlean stands in the poetry section and reads a Wallace
Stevens book.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          The greatest poverty is not to live/In a
          physical world, to feel that one's
          desire/is too difficult to tell from
          despair.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman is on the floor typing.   His mini-recorder is on.

                    KAUFMAN'S VOICE (ON RECORDER)
          Kaufman sits across from Valerie, a
          pretty film executive. He eyes her as
          she picks at her salad. She looks up and
          he looks down. He sweats. She
          compliments him on his work. She rubs
          her nose. He pulls at his nostrils. He
          tries to sound like he knows what he's
          talking about. He's full of shit.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean dials the phone.

          John, it's Susan.

                      LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          I know.

                    ORLEAN
          I went to the Orchid Society Show a
          couple of days ago.

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          I'm not interested.

                    ORLEAN
          There was a display of you stealing the
          ghost orchids. You're famous.

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          I'm not involved in that world now.

                    ORLEAN
          So, look, John, I still haven't seen a
          ghost. And I was wondering --

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Yeah, yeah. I'll take you in.

                     ORLEAN
          Really?   Thank you so much!   I just...

                    LAROCHE (PHONE VOICE)
          Tomorrow. Pick me up at 5:30 am or it'll
          get too hot. I'll buy all the supplies
          we'll need.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Kaufman jerks off to the book jacket
          photo of Susan Orlean.

Donald appears in the doorway with a script.

                      KAUFMAN
          What?!    What do you want?

                    DONALD
          I finished. My script.    I'm done.

Kaufman stares at his typewriter, doesn't say anything.

                    DONALD (cont'd)
          So would you show it to your agent?

Kaufman grabs Donald's script and throws it on his bed.

                    DONALD (cont'd)
          Thanks. Also, I wanted to thank you for
          your idea. It was very helpful. I
          changed it a little. Now the killer cuts
          off body pieces and makes the victims eat
          them.   It's, like, I once saw this
          picture of a snake swallowing it's tail --

Kaufman collapses, puts his head in his hands.

                    KAUFMAN
          Ourobouros.

                    DONALD
          I don't know what that means.

                    KAUFMAN
          The snake is called Ourobouros.

                    DONALD
          I don't think so. But it's cool for my
          killer to have this modus operandi.
          Because at the end when he forces the
          woman, who's really just him, to eat
          herself, he's also eating himself to
          death.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm insane. I'm Ourobouros.

                    DONALD
          I don't know what that is.

                    KAUFMAN
          I've written myself into my screenplay.
          It's eating itself. I'm eating myself.

                     DONALD
          Oh.   That's kinda weird.

                    KAUFMAN
          It's self-indulgent. It's narcissistic.
          It's solipsistic. It's pathetic. I'm
          pathetic. I'm fat and pathetic.

                    DONALD
          I'm sure you had a good reason, Charles.
          You're an artist.

                    KAUFMAN
          The reason is I'm too timid to speak to
          the woman who wrote the book. Because
          I'm pathetic. Because I have no idea how
          to write. Because I can't make flowers
          fascinating. Because I suck.

                    DONALD
          Hey, am I in the script, too?

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm going to New York. I'll meet her.
          That's it. That's what I have to do.

                    DONALD
          Don't get mad at me for saying this,
          Charles, but Bob's got a seminar in New
          York this weekend. So if you're stuck --

Kaufman shoots Donald a look.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

The lights are off.   Orlean is in bed, sleeping fitfully.

INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Kaufman reads Ann Landers's column in a paper dated July 4th.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Give yourself a reality check. Phoniness
          is transparent, and it is tiresome. Take
          pleasure in the beauty and wonders of
          nature. A flower is God's miracle.

Out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below,
like small flowers blooming on the black earth. His eyes
well with tears.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman sleeps fitfully.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Orlean walks through alone, panicked. All the vegetation is
greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before. Things
slither by in the water, brush up against her.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            78.
CONTINUED:

She tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a
vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate
herself. She falls face forward into the black water.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. She
heaves, looks at the clock. It's 3:30. She stares at the
ceiling. She looks at the clock again. It's 3:30. She
looks at the clock again. It's 4:10. She closes her eyes.
She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with
murky water, the bed an island of dryness. An alligator
pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the
bed. Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. The
room is back to normal. The clock reads 4:23. She closes
her eyes. The alarm goes off.

EXT. LAROCHE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Orlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands, dressed in
a short sleeve shirt, thin pants, and his Miami Hurricanes
hat. He opens the door and climbs in.

                    ORLEAN
          Where are our supplies?

                    LAROCHE
          Got everything I need right here.

Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.
Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering
wheel. Laroche shrugs.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Look, don't worry about it. We'll get
          crap at the Indian trading post on
          Alligator Alley. Hey, want me to drive?

INT. CAR - A BIT LATER

The sun has come up strong. It looks hot. Laroche speeds
along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention
to the road. The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily
corrects it. Orlean is tense.

                    LAROCHE
          I remember one time when I was a kid,
          fifteen or so, my mother and I came to
          the Fakahatchee to look for a ghost to
          photograph. We walked for hours, through
          the most intense heat I'd ever felt.   We
          couldn't find one. I wanted to turn
          back. But my mom said, no.

                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          She said, John, if you keep searching for
          something past doubt, past hopelessness,
          past the absolute certainty that you'll
          never find it, if you keep searching past
          that, there it'll be. So we walked. I
          had goddamn bloody blisters on my feet.
          And we found ourselves in this charred
          prairie, desolate, sun blasted, y'know.
          And there in the middle of it was this
          one gorgeous, snowy Polyrrhiza lindenii.

They drive in silence for a little while.   She watches him.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Orlean types at her desk.   She turns to us and talks.

                    ORLEAN
          He made it sound like a Bible story, the
          hopeful journey through darkness into
          light. I never thought many people in
          the world were like John, but I was
          realizing more and more that Laroche was
          an extreme, not an aberration -- most
          people in some way or another do strive
          for something exceptional, something to
          pursue, even at their peril, rather than
          abide an ordinary life.

EXT. MIDTOWN NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Kaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along. He arrives at the
New Yorker building and enters with steely determination.

INT. BUILDING - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman waits for the elevator, sweating even more profusely.
The elevator doors open. People get off, people get on, the
elevator doors close. Kaufman still stands there.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water. They
sink to their knees. The ground is soft; it's a struggle to
pull their feet up to walk. Things slither past in the
water. Something big runs by in the distance. Bees, and
dragonflies hover. Gnats and mosquitoes bite. Birds
screech. Frogs croak. Laroche points to a yellow flower.

                    LAROCHE
          Here we go. Encyclia tempensis.

Laroche lights a cigarette.


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             80.
CONTINUED:


                    LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Nice little sucker, isn't it?

Orlean examines it from a distance.

                      ORLEAN
          Cute.

Laroche continues walking and Orlean attempts to keep pace.
He points at a tiny orchid on another tree.

                    LAROCHE
          Clamshell orchid. You know that.

                      ORLEAN
          Uh-huh.

                    LAROCHE
          See, I found you two already. I'll show
          you every orchid you want today. I'll
          find you a fucking ghost if it kills me.
              (pointing to another orchid)
          Rigid Epidendrum. That's an ugly-ass
          orchid. But I'm no snob. I'm interested
          in all orchids. Not just pretty ones.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

A miserable Kaufman sits in the window, sipping coffee and
watching the New Yorker building across the street. He
steels himself, exits the coffee shop.

INT. ELEVATOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator. It stops a few
times; people get off and on. Kaufman sweats. The doors
open. The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite
the elevator. Nobody gets off or on. The doors close. The
elevator continues up. Kaufman hates himself. Soon the
elevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman. It
begins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker.
This time Orlean gets on. Kaufman is absolutely panicked.
Orlean looks at him blankly, presses "lobby", and faces
front. Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. The
elevator arrives at the lobby. Orlean gets out. Kaufman
hesitates, then follows.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Orlean walks along.   Kaufman follows her.

                                                              81.



EXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING

The sun is much higher in the sky. Orlean is a sweaty mess,
frizzed hair, anxious, scraped, dirty.

                    LAROCHE
              (peppy)
          They're right nearby.    Just follow me.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Orlean sits by herself, reading Vanity Fair. Kaufman sits a
few tables away. He scribbles in his notebook.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Reads Vanity Fair. Funny detail: New
          Yorker writer reads Vanity Fair. Use!

A waitress brings a tuna sandwich and an ice tea to Orlean.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          Likes tuna, drinks ice tea. Good
          character details. Good stuff!

Orlean looks up from her magazine and smiles at the waitress.

                     ORLEAN
          Thanks.   Could I get some lemon please?

The waitress nods and leaves.   Kaufman scribbles.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          Likes lemon in tea and her voice is not
          at all what I imagined. Interesting!

EXT. SWAMP - NOON

Orlean follows Laroche. She watches him start off in one
direction, stop, start off another direction, then go
straight ahead. Orlean seems depressed.

                    ORLEAN
          Laroche, can I ask you a personal
          question?

Laroche turns and scowls at her.

                    LAROCHE
          We're not lost.

EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

Orlean window shops at a shoe store.   Kaufman takes notes.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
             Eyeing Stuart Weitzman pumps.    Okay.

Orlean heads down the street. Kaufman follows. She enters
the New Yorker building. Kaufman waits outside.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

The sun is hot. Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean. She
watches him march forward with great authority. She massages
her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman reviews his notes.       He is sweaty and wild-eyed.

                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
             I have nothing. I am nothing.     I am fat.
             I am over. I am lost.

EXT. SWAMP    - LATER

The sun is high. Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground. She
stares at him. Laroche won't look at her. He busies himself
opening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche
speaks without looking up.

                       LAROCHE
             We're not lost.

Laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             I'm just turned around a little.

He looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around
on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             A sundial. I'll just set this up, wait a
             few minutes, and we'll be able to tell
             which way the sun is moving. We want to
             be heading southeast.

Laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it.

                        LAROCHE (cont'd)
             This is no big deal. You should eat
             something.

Orlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches
his legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean,
he puts the twig back.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             So do you collect anything?

                       ORLEAN
                 (non-responsive)
             Not really.

                       LAROCHE
             Well, y'know it's not really about
             collecting the thing, it's about --

                       ORLEAN
             The sundial isn't working.

Laroche looks down at it.

                       LAROCHE
             It is so working.

Orlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at
Laroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and
panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls.
Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her
brain. Laroche seems unaware.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             The thing about computers. The thing I
             like is that I'm immersed in it but it's
             not a living thing that's going to leave
             or die or something. I prefer having the
             minimum number of living things to worry
             about in my life.

Orlean's anger softens.    She looks sadly at Laroche.

                       ORLEAN
             So, John...

                       LAROCHE
             Okay, fuck the sundial. We'll just go
             straight and eventually we'll get there.

They rise.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
             What I mean is we'll get somewhere. Out
             of here. I mean, logically, we have to
             get out as long as we walk straight.

Laroche points them in a direction and they walk.

                                                             84.



INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Kaufman is sleeping. It looks like it's been a rough night.
The phone rings. He reaches for it.

                        KAUFMAN
          Hello?

                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          Hey, it's Jerry. I woke you?

                    KAUFMAN
          No, it's okay.

                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          How's it going? Has it been helpful to
          talk to the writer? What's her name?

                      KAUFMAN
          Yeah.    Susan Orlean.

                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          Well, I mean, are you making headway?
          Valerie's breathing down my neck.

                    KAUFMAN
          You can't rush inspiration.   Y'know?

                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          Okay, fine. Um, the other reason I'm
          calling is to tell you Me, Myself, and I
          is just amazing.

                    KAUFMAN
          What the hell is Me, Myself, and I?

                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          Your brother's script. It's tight,
          inventive. A smart, edgy thriller. The
          best spec script I've read this year.

                        KAUFMAN
          Oh.   Good.

                    JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
          I'm gonna sell it for a shitload. Two
          fucking talented guys in one family.
          Y'know, maybe you could bring Donald on
          to help you finish the orchid thing.

                    KAUFMAN
          Jerry, don't say that.   I mean --


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             85.
CONTINUED:


                       JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
             Just a thought, buddy. He's really
             goddamn amazing at structure.

                       KAUFMAN
             Jerry, I gotta go. I have an
             appointment. I gotta go.

                       JERRY (TELEPHONE VOICE)
             Adios, buddy. Finish! Finish!

EXT. NYC STREETS (MONTAGE) - MORNING

Kaufman wanders. He eyes other sad-looking, balding,
overweight men wandering the streets also.

                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
             I am fat. I can't write. I am
             repulsive. I am old. I have
             accomplished nothing. I am just one more
             old, fat, bald man on the street.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads the way. There's a sadness, a sense of defeat
and humiliation that he tries to conceal. Orlean is stony.

                       LAROCHE
             I've done this a million times. Whenever
             everything's killing me, I just say to
             myself, screw it, and go straight ahead.

Laroche leads Orlean back into the brush.

EXT. NYC STREET - MORNING

Kaufman sees a white school building ahead, glowing in the
sun. He walks toward it.

INT. LOBBY - MORNING

The lobby of an auditorium, crowded with enthusiastic people
signing up for something. Kaufman waits in line.    He
watches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an
attractive female registrar. The guy moves on and the
attractive registrar looks without interest at Kaufman.

                       REGISTRAR
             May I help you?

Kaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze; they come to rest
on a pile of McKee's book Story next to her.

                                                            86.



INT. AUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER

Kaufman sits in the packed room.   McKee paces the stage with
a mic clipped to his lapel.

                    MCKEE
          Years from now you'll be standing around
          a posh cocktail party congratulating
          yourself on how you spent an entire
          weekend locked in a room with an asshole,
          an opinionated arrogant asshole, for your
          art.

The audience laughs, except for Kaufman who looks pained.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I am pathetic. I am a loser.    I am fat.

                    MCKEE
          So... what is the substance of writing?
          Nothing as trivial as words is at the
          heart of this great art, my friends.

McKee continues to talk but his voice goes under.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          I have failed. I am panicked. I am fat.
          I have sold out. I am worthless. I...

                    MCKEE
          Literary talent is not enough. First,
          last, and always, the imperative is to
          tell a story.

Kaufman watches with disdain as people take notes.

                    MCKEE
          Twenty three hundred years ago, Aristotle
          said, when storytelling goes bad in a
          society, the result is decadence.
              (deadpan)
          Well, just look around you.

Everyone, except Kaufman, laughs giddily at McKee's joke.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Aristotle also said: A story must have a
          beginning, a middle, and an end.

The students nod in appreciation at this profundity.

                                                            87.



INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

McKee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead
projector. It's some kind of complicated time-line with act-
breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated. The
audience members take copious notes. Kaufman sweats.

                    KAUFMAN (V.O.)
          It is my weakness, my ultimate lack of
          conviction that brings me here with all
          these desperate idiots lapping up
          everything this bag of wind spouts. Easy
          answers. Rules to short-cut yourself to
          success. And here I am, because my jaunt
          into the abyss brought me nothing. Well,
          isn't that the risk one takes for
          attempting something new. I should leave
          here right now. I'll start over --
              (starts to rise)
          I need to face this project head on and --

                    MCKEE
          ... and God help you if you use voice-
          over in your work, my friends.

Kaufman stops, looks up, startled.    McKee seems to be looking
at him.

                    MCKEE
          God fucking help you! It's flaccid,
          sloppy writing. Any idiot can write
          voice-over narration to explain the
          thoughts of a character. You must
          present the internal conflicts of your
          character in image, in symbol. Film is a
          medium of movement and image.

Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. "Any
idiot..." writes the guy on one side of him. "Flaccid..."
writes the guy on the other side.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Okay, one hour for lunch.

EXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Students exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman
wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound.

                                                           88.



INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

McKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of
Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a
bust of Aristotle on the cover.

                    MCKEE
          You want your writing to be original.
          You want to have an original voice like
          Neil Simon or Nora Ephron. Well, let me
          tell you something, my friends. The key
          to originality is not eccentricity.

A guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative "mmmm."

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

It's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now
Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears
his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly
planted on his face as he talks and talks.

                    MCKEE
          Long speechs are antithetical to the
          nature of cinema. The Greeks called it
          stykomythia -- the rapid exchange of
          ideas. A long speech in a script, say a
          page long, requires that the camera hold
          on the actor's face for a minute. Look
          at the second hand on your watch as it
          makes one complete rotation around the
          clock face and you'll get an idea of how
          intolerable that would be for an
          audience. The ontology of the screen is
          that it's always now and it's always
          action and it's always vivid. Life is
          rarely vivid. And that's an important
          point. We are not recreating life on the
          screen. Writers are not tape recorders.
          Have you ever eavesdropped on people
          talking in a coffee shop? Then you know
          how dull and tedious real conversation
          is. Real people are not interesting.
          There's not a person in this world -- and
          I include myself in this -- who would be
          interesting enough to take as is and put
          in a movie as a character.

                                                 DISSOLVE TO:

                                                             89.



INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER STILL

McKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee.

                    MCKEE
          Someone asked me recently, Bob, do you
          think Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty.

He pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then:

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
              (deadpan)
          Michelle Pfeiffer is proof, my friends,
          that there's a fucking God.

The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter.
Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Okay. That's it for tonight. Remember,
          there'll be a Q and A tomorrow morning
          before class starts.

INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Kaufman tosses and turns in bed.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DREAM-LIKE FIELD - DAY

The daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel
engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in
the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight.

INT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING

Kaufman, bleary-eyed, sits in the back.   McKee paces.

                    MCKEE
          Anyone else?

Kaufman timidly raises his hand.

                     MCKEE (cont'd)
          Yes?




                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            90.
CONTINUED:


                    KAUFMAN
          You talked about Crisis as the ultimate
          decision a character makes, but what if a
          writer is attempting to create a story
          where nothing much happens, where people
          don't change, they don't have any
          epiphanies. They struggle and are
          frustrated and nothing is resolved. More
          a reflection of the real world --

                    MCKEE
          The real world? The real fucking world?
          First of all, if you write a screenplay
          without conflict or crisis, you'll bore
          your audience to tears. Secondly:
          Nothing happens in the real world? Are
          you out of your fucking mind? People are
          murdered every day! There's genocide and
          war and corruption! Every fucking day
          somewhere in the world somebody
          sacrifices his life to save someone else!
          Every fucking day someone somewhere makes
          a conscious decision to destroy someone
          else! People find love! People lose it,
          for Christ's sake! A child watches her
          mother beaten to death on the steps of a
          church! Someone goes hungry! Somebody
          else betrays his best friend for a woman!
          If you can't find that stuff in life,
          then you, my friend, don't know much
          about life! And why the fuck are you
          taking up my precious two hours with your
          movie? I don't have any use for it! I
          don't have any bloody use for it!

                    KAUFMAN
          Okay, thanks.

EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

The last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits,
leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his
brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him.

                       KAUFMAN
          Mr. McKee?

                       MCKEE
          Yes?

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm the guy you yelled at this morning.


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           91.
CONTINUED:


                    MCKEE
              (trying to recall)
          I need more.

                    KAUFMAN
          I was the one who thought things didn't
          happen in life.

                    MCKEE
          Oh, right, okay.    Nice to see you.

                    KAUFMAN
          I need to talk.

                    MCKEE
          I make it a rule not to give private
          tutorials to my seminar students. It
          wouldn't be fair to the others.

                    KAUFMAN
          Mr. McKee, please. My even standing here
          is very scary. I don't meet people well.
          I'm self-conscious and timid. But what
          you said this morning shook me to the
          bone. What you said was bigger than my
          screenwriting choices. It's about my
          choices as a human being. Please.

McKee hesitates for a moment, then reaches out and puts his
arm around Kaufman.

                    MCKEE
          I could use a drink, my friend.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose,
looking only straight ahead. As they walk the sounds and
colors become subdued. Soon there is silence.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          We turned to the right and saw only more
          cypress and palm and sawgrass

They turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.) (cont'd)
          So we turned to the left, and there, far
          down the diagonal of the levee, we could
          see the gleam of a fender. We followed
          it like a beacon all the way to the road.

Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car.

                                                               92.



INT. BAR - NIGHT

Kaufman and McKee sit at a table with beers.   Kaufman reads
from his copy of The Orchid Thief.

                    KAUFMAN
          ... We followed it like a beacon all the
          way to the road.

Kaufman closes the book.   There's a pause.

                    MCKEE
          Then what happens?

                    KAUFMAN
          That's the book. I wanted to present it
          simply, without big character arcs or
          sensationalizing the story. I wanted to
          show flowers as God's miracles.   I
          wanted to show that Orlean never saw the
          blooming ghost orchid. It's about
          disappointment.

                    MCKEE
          I see. That's not a movie.     You must go
          back and put in the drama.

                    KAUFMAN
              (pause)
          I've got pages of false starts and wrong
          approaches. I'm way past my deadline. I
          can't go back.

                    MCKEE
          Ah, the everpresent deadline. Yes, I was
          doing a Kojak once and... it was hell.

McKee sips his beer, eyes Kaufman.

                    MCKEE (cont'd)
          Tell you a secret. The last act makes
          the film. You can have an uninvolving,
          tedious movie, but wow them at the end,
          and you've got a hit. Find an ending.
          Use what you've learned this weekend.
          Give them that and you'll be fine.

Tears form in Kaufman's eyes.

                    KAUFMAN
          You promise?

McKee smiles.   Kaufman hugs him.   McKee recognizes his bulk.

             You've taken my course before?

                       KAUFMAN
             My brother did. My twin brother Donald.
             He's the one who got me to come.

                       MCKEE
             Twin screenwriters. Julius and Philip
             Epstein,who wrote Casablanca were twins.

                       KAUFMAN
             You mentioned that in class.

                       MCKEE
             The finest screenplay ever written.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A drunken Kaufman paces, tries to read Story. McKee's Ten
Commandments are taped to the wall. As is a photo of
Michelle Pfeiffer ripped from a magazine.

                       KAUFMAN (V.O.)
             Climax. A revolution in values from
             positive to negative or negative to
             positive with or without irony -- a value
             swing at maximum charge that's absolute
             and irreversible.

Kaufman is lost.       He rubs his temples.   He dials the phone.

                       DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
             Great writers residence.

                         KAUFMAN
             Donald.

                       DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
             Hey, how's the trip? Gettin' it on with
             that lady journalist? You dog you!

                       KAUFMAN
             Yeah. Listen, I'm calling to say
             congratulations on your script.

                       DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
             Isn't that cool? Jerry says he can make
             me, like, high-sixes against a mill-five.

                       KAUFMAN
             That's great, Donald.

                    DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
          I want to thank you for all your help.

                    KAUFMAN
          I wasn't any help.

                    DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
          C'mon, you let me stay in your place and
          your integrity inspired me to even try.

                    KAUFMAN
          Well, look, I've been thinking, maybe
          you'd be interested in hanging out with
          me in New York for a few days.

                    DONALD (PHONE VOICE)
          Oh my God, yes! I'm flattered!

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the
script. Kaufman paces. Donald finishes, is quiet.

                    KAUFMAN
          So, like, what would you do?

                    DONALD
          Script kind of makes fun of me, huh?

                     KAUFMAN
          Sorry.   I was trying something.   I --

                    DONALD
          Hey, I don't mind.   It's funny.

                      KAUFMAN
          Okay.    So, what would you do?

                    DONALD
          You and me are so different, Charles.
          We're different talents.

                    KAUFMAN
          I know. Just for fun. How would the
          great Donald end this script?

                    DONALD
              (giggling)
          The great Donald.
              (serious)
          Well, I mean... do you need the whole
          court case?


                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             95.
CONTINUED:


                   KAUFMAN
         Uh, it's what happened to Laroche.   It's
         kind of important.

                   DONALD
         It's boring. No offense. A courtroom
         scene should be dramatic. Stick the
         ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe.

                       KAUFMAN
         Um.   Okay.

                   DONALD
         Too much about orchids. Get rid of it.
         Pare that stuff down to a minimum.
         Frankly, I'd focus more on the
         relationship between the brothers. I
         think that's the gold here. No one cares
         about orchids.

                   KAUFMAN
         The book's about orchids.

                   DONALD
         That's a problem. But don't let it ruin
         the movie. I mean, for example, use the
         orchids in a more dramatic way. Have
         some kind of bang-up, crazy action
         sequence in the swamp. Use the swamp
         better. It's a tremendous fictional
         world. A setting of great dramatic
         possibility.

                    KAUFMAN
          That's true. But --

                   DONALD
         And put some twists in. Reveal some
         surprising thing about Laroche. God,
         what am I doing giving suggestions to
         you? I mean you're like a seasoned
         professional. You're an artist.

                   KAUFMAN
         C'mon, you're the "mill-five" kid.

                   DONALD
             (enjoying this)
         Shut up!
             (thinks)
         I love the Laroche porno web-site stuff.
         Is that real? Maybe make a bigger deal
         of that. I don't know.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                            96.
CONTINUED: (2)


                    KAUFMAN
          I think it's real.   I haven't actually
          seen the site.

                    DONALD
          It's sex, man! Incorporate it.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The front door opens and Kaufman enters. The lights are off,
but the room is aglow with light from Donald's laptop
computer. Kaufman sees a silhouetted Donald masturbating in
front of the computer. Donald looks up, caught.

                    DONALD
          Oh, hi, I was doing some research.   I
          found Laroche's site and... I'm
          embarrassed.

                    KAUFMAN
          Jesus, Donald.

Kaufman passes Donald, glances at the grainy nude on the
screen. He's stunned. It's Orlean smiling at him.

                    DONALD
          What? She's kinda cute. You don't like
          her? I dunno, I think she's okay. It's
          not like I'm marrying her.

Kaufman shows Donald Orlean's book jacket photo.

                     DONALD (cont'd)
          Oh, wow.   That's kind of a twist, huh?

                     KAUFMAN
          Jesus.   Jesus!

                    DONALD
          I think this is maybe a good thing for
          the script. Go ask her about this.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm not gonna ask her about this.

                    DONALD
          You want me to? I don't mind.

                    KAUFMAN
          No, I don't want you to.

                    DONALD
          I could easily pretend I'm you.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                       KAUFMAN
          No!    No!

INT. NEW YORK OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Donald, dressed like Kaufman, waits by the elevators. Orlean
emerges. He's about to talk to her, when she pulls out a
cell phone and dials. Donald decides to be a spy and follows
her out of the building.

EXT. NEW YORK OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Orlean talks on the phone.       Donald trails close behind her.

                       ORLEAN
             So you'll pick me up?    Yeah, tomorrow.

Orlean stops to look in a shoe store window. Donald stops
and looks in the window also. Orlean doesn't notice him.

                       ORLEAN (cont'd)
             Ten-twenty. TWA. Yes, of course I will.

Donald walks off.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Donald is focused on the computer. Kaufman sits in a chair
in the corner. Both men are in pajamas.

                       KAUFMAN
             What was she wearing?

                       DONALD
             I don't know. Like a dress maybe.

                       KAUFMAN
             Did she look at me?    At you?

                    DONALD
          Finally! Da-da-da-daaaaah! S. Orlean,
          TWA flight 651. Arriving Miami 10:20
          tomorrow morning.

Donald turns and smiles across the room to Kaufman.

                    KAUFMAN
          I don't want to do this, Donald.

                    DONALD
          We'll go together.       It'll be good.



                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:


Kaufman looks squeamish. Donald picks up a hairbrush, holds
it to his mouth. He starts to sing "Happy Together."
Kaufman smiles sheepishly, shrugs Donald off. Donald
persists. Finally Kaufman joins in. They do the whole
number and fall laughing into each other's arms.

EXT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Orlean waits with a suitcase outside the terminal. The beat-
up white van pulls up. Orlean gets in, the van speeds off.
Another car pulls away from the curb and follows it.

INT. CAR - A BIT LATER

Donald drives, keeping up with the van, which speeds and
swerves through traffic. Kaufman is sweaty, nervous.

                     KAUFMAN
          It's so weird to actually see that van in
          real life.

                    DONALD
          So you want to build the symbolic charge
          of the story's imagery from the
          particular to the universal. Okay?

                    KAUFMAN
          Okay, but when you're creating an image
          system, how do you know --

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

The van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle-class
house. Kaufman and Donald drive by, in time to see Orlean
and Laroche emerge from the van. Orlean seems different now:
more exotic. She's wearing some kind of sexy sarong. Donald
drives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches
as Laroche lugs Orlean's suitcase into the house.

                    DONALD
          I'll get a closer look.   You wait here.

                    KAUFMAN
              (momentously)
          No, I want to go. I should go. I mean,
          it should be me, right? I mean...

                    DONALD
          Go for it, bro. You the man.

Kaufman gets out of the car. Donald gets in, peruses
Kaufman's script. Kaufman walks past the house, trying to
peer in windows. He sees nothing. He slinks around back.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               99.
CONTINUED:

In the yard, Kaufman finds a greenhouse.    It's filled with
row upon row of ghost orchids.

                       KAUFMAN
          Holy...

There's movement in a window in the house.    Kaufman ducks.

                    LAROCHE (O.S.)
          Darlin', I dunno what's come over you!

Kaufman crawls over to the house, lifts his face to the
window. Orlean and Laroche are laughing, kissing, groping,
and undressing each other. Kaufman is heartbroken but
transfixed. Suddenly Laroche locks eyes with Kaufman.

                    ORLEAN
          Don't stop, Johnny.

Laroche jumps up and runs naked to the back door.

                    ORLEAN (CONT'D)
          Johnny! Where are you going?

Kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house.
Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house.

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Laroche throws Kaufman down into a chair. The chair slides
across the floor, tips over. Orlean seems uninterested. She
kisses Laroche's leg.

                    LAROCHE
          Who the hell are you?

Kaufman notices Laroche has a set of beautiful, white teeth.

                    KAUFMAN
          I just... nobody, I just --

Laroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut.

                       LAROCHE
             Who the fuck are you?

                       KAUFMAN
             Um. I'm just. I was at the wrong house.
             I'm looking for the Johnson family.

                       LAROCHE
             I got your Johnson family right here.

Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.     Orlean kisses Laroche's
back. Kaufman whimpers.

                    ORLEAN
          Honey, come back to bed.

                    LAROCHE
          Who the hell sent you?      Rudy?

                       KAUFMAN
          I'm not --

Again Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.      His scalp bleeds.

                    KAUFMAN (cont'd)
          I'm the screenwriter.

                    LAROCHE
          What the fuck does that mean?

                     KAUFMAN
          I'm the guy adapting her book.      Her book
          about you.

This registers with Laroche.

                    LAROCHE
          Jesus Fucking Christ.
              (then, trying to make sense)
          Why the fuck were you in my backyard?

                    KAUFMAN
          I was, um, trying... I don't know.

Orlean is unforgiving.

                    ORLEAN
          Who's the bloody fat guy?

                    LAROCHE
          This is the fellow adapting your book for
          the movies, darling'.

                    ORLEAN
              (excited)
          Really? I wanted to meet --
              (realizing)
          Oh. What does he know?

                       KAUFMAN
             I don't know anything.   I swear.

          He knows about the greenhouse.
              (to Orlean)
          We can't have this appear on the silver
          screen.

                      KAUFMAN
          It won't.    I don't even under --

                    ORLEAN
          Johnny, I'm so tired now.

Orlean lies down.   Laroche paces.   Donald peers, unseen, into
the back window.

                    LAROCHE
          He needs to be gotten rid of.

                      KAUFMAN
          What?!

Donald's eyes widen. Laroche paces. Orlean watches Laroche,
fascinated by his every muscle movement.

                    LAROCHE
          Small article in newspaper.

Orlean snaps out of her muscle fixation, becomes fixated on
his voice, his lips.

          drowned in the Fakahatchee after
          accidentally slipping and hitting his
          head on a rock. End of story. Is that
          credible from a journalistic standpoint?

                    ORLEAN
          Johnny, come lie on top of me.

                    LAROCHE
          Focus, darling'. Is this credible?

                     ORLEAN
               (concentrates)
          Um, oh... this screenwriter was killed
          doing research in Jamaica a few years
          ago.
               (to Kaufman)
          Screenwriter, you have a car?

                    KAUFMAN
          I, um, no, I --

Laroche gets ready to kick him again.

                    KAUFMAN (cont'd)
          A rental, a rental.

                    ORLEAN
          We drive his car there, leave it on the
          side of the swamp. That works.

                     LAROCHE
          Good.   I like that.

                    ORLEAN
              (to Kaufman)
          Sorry.

                     KAUFMAN
          Please.

Donald disappears from the window.

INT. RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

Kaufman drives. The headlights shine on Laroche's van ahead.
Orlean, no longer stoned, sits next to him, holding a gun.
She skims Kaufman's screenplay.

                     KAUFMAN
          I thought I had a sense of you from your
          book.
              (beat)
          I had a little crush on you, to tell the
          truth. You're different than I thought.

                     ORLEAN
          Huh.

                    KAUFMAN
          Look, I don't care what you two are you
          doing.   Please don't kill me.

                    ORLEAN
          Hey, here's one of my lines.
              (mockingly reading from screen)
          "Isn't it ironic? You adapting my book?
          My three years in Florida meditating on
          my inability to experience passion
          resulted in my finding it with you."

                                                            103.

                    KAUFMAN
          I was trying to do something.

                    ORLEAN
          Well, it's kind of pathetic, dontcha
          think?

They drive in silence.    Orlean reads more of the screenplay.

                    ORLEAN
          Here's me! Here's me again!
              (mocking)
          "I wanted to know what it's like to care
          about something passionately."

Orlean laughs derisively.

                    KAUFMAN
          You can laugh, but I didn't make that
          line up. That's a quote from your book.

                    ORLEAN
          Yeah, I know, Charlie-boy. Chill. I'm
          laughing at who I used to be. It's sad.

                    KAUFMAN
          So now you learned about passion.
              (jealous)
          From Weirdo Laroche. Bully for you.

                    ORLEAN
          You can't learn about passion. You can
          be passion. And it wasn't John who made
          me passion. It was orchids.

                    KAUFMAN
          I thought you didn't even like orchids.

                    ORLEAN
          I lied about what happened at the end of
          the book. On the way out of the swamp...

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp. He spots something
on a tree, circles it, and stands there, awestruck. Orlean
comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from
the tree.

                       LAROCHE
             The jewel of the Fakahatchee.

Orlean looks at it, tries to feel some passion for it, can't.

                    ORLEAN
          I still don't get it. I mean, there it
          is. I can see it's pretty, but --

                    LAROCHE
          You'll get it.

Laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch.

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

There's a makeshift lab. Laroche is extracting some gooey
substance from the nectary.

                    ORLEAN (V.O.)
          Back in John's basement he explained his
          real plans for the ghost. He'd
          discovered a chemical inside with
          psychoactive properties. His plan had
          always been to clone the flower and make
          a fortune marketing this drug. It was
          Laroche's kind of plan, it wasn't a
          controlled substance because the
          government didn't know it existed.

INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean nervously snorts some green powder off the coffee
table while Laroche watches. She talks to the camera.

                    ORLEAN
          The first time I tried it, the split
          second it took effect, I understood
          orchids. I loved them with a passion I'd
          never felt for anything. For anyone.

The drug takes effect and Orlean turns away from us, becomes
fixated on the ghost orchid sitting on the table before her.
She smells it, caresses it, cries at its beauty.

INT. RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

                       ORLEAN
             Isn't it curious? An orchid made me
             passionate about orchids.

                       KAUFMAN
             You're throwing the truth away for a
             chemical confusion of your synapses --

                       ORLEAN
             With this powder I am passionate about
             everything.

          I'm alive in a profound world now. It
          sizzles with beauty and horror and sex.
          Now writing is -- words are -- a way to
          remove yourself from passion. So I'm
          done with writing. John and I are making
          a fortune with this extract. It's big in
          the Miami club scene. We call it
          "Passion."
              (giggles)
          Isn't that cute?

Up ahead, Laroche turns off the road at the Fakahatchee sign.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          Follow him, please.

EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Laroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures
with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the
car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche
emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over
his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman
shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high
water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops.

                    LAROCHE
          This spot looks good.
              (thinking aloud)
          Now how do we do this? Hit him in the
          head with a rock first? Keeping in mind
          we can only hit him once and only with as
          much force as would be created by him
          slipping and falling onto the rock.

Laroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock.
She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out
of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in.

                       ORLEAN
             Holy Jesus. Holy...   Hey, baby, hey...

Orlean trails off.    Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean.

                       LAROCHE
             Should we drown him, then hit him on the
             head? Uh-uh. A body bleeds different if
             the heart's stopped. These new forensic
             guys are very smart. We really have to
             know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor
             mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular
             changes.

          Maybe you think we hit him on the head
          and force water into his lungs after he's
          dead? No, darlin'. They'll know he
          didn't drown. See, contrary to popular
          belief, the lungs do not -- do not --
          fill with water in a drowning. What
          happens is, choking causes an irritation
          of the mucous membranes. This creates a
          shitload of mucus in the windpipe.
          Efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a
          sticky foam which may or may not mix with
          vomit. It's the presence of this white
          foam that indicates drowning. There's a
          lot to be aware of, Susie. Shoeprints,
          hair, microscopic fibers. Tire tracks.
          They all tell a tale to today's forensic
          scientists.
              (to Kaufman)
          What do you think? You're a writer. How
          would you do it? What's a good way to
          kill somebody?

                    KAUFMAN
          I don't write this kind of bullshit.

                    LAROCHE
          Don't get all huffy, I was simply --

Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into
the water. Orlean looks up, spaced.    She's confused by a
second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil.
Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road.

Laroche pulls himself from the water.

                       LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Fuck!

                       ORLEAN
                 (receptively)
             Yeah, let's, baby.

She staggers moonily toward Laroche.      He pushes her away.

                       LAROCHE
             Not now. We got to kill that guy. And
             now I guess that other guy as well.

                       ORLEAN
                 (disappointed)
             Ohhh.

                                                            107.



INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road.

                    KAUFMAN
          For Christ's sake, why didn't you do
          something while we were in the car?

                    DONALD
          My back had seized.     I couldn't move.

Laroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind.

                    KAUFMAN
          Shit!

It rams them again, this time sending them down into the
swamp. The van stops. Donald tries to back the car onto the
road; the wheels just spin. Laroche steps out of the van.

                    DONALD
          We've gotta ditch this thing.

                    KAUFMAN
              (hysterical)
          It's a rental! It's a rental!

                    DONALD
          Now!

Kaufman and Donald climb from the car, make their way deep
into the swamp. Laroche follows them in on foot, dragging
Orlean, who is admiring all the plant life.

                    ORLEAN
          That's beautiful! What's that, Johnny?
          What's that one called? I just so want
          to fuck that flower, don't you?

                    LAROCHE
          Asclepias lanceolata. Red milkweed.
          Extremely fuckable. But we don't have
          time.

Laroche shoots at the brothers.    Kaufman whines.

                    LAROCHE
              (to Orlean)
          What's his name?

                    ORLEAN
          Um, y'know... Charlie or something.

                    LAROCHE
          Charlie! Listen, let's talk! This pie
          is big enough for four people!
              (to Orlean)
          Why are there two of him?

Orlean shrugs.

                    ORLEAN
          Identical twigs?
              (laughs crazily)
          Did I say twigs? I meant twins.

Kaufman and Donald run through a colony of sawgrass. It
slices them like razor blades. Kaufman yells in pain. Blood
oozes through their shirts and pants.

                    LAROCHE
          Cladium jamaicense, guys. Sawgrass. You
          want to watch out for that. That's some
          evil shit. Cut you up.

                    KAUFMAN
          Fuck you, Laroche!

                    LAROCHE
          Just tryin' to be helpful. Walk with us
          and I'll be sure you avoid all the
          pitfalls. I know these swamps forwards
          and backwards. There's alligators and
          poisonous snakes, fellas. Wild hogs.

Kaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water.
Nowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers
run along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops.

                     DONALD
          Wait.   Do you hear something?

Kaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing.

                    KAUFMAN
          Donald, that sounds bad.

The brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping
gets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the
shore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark
for bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and
Orlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the
engine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the
pigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman
kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick
connects and the pig flies into the water.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

Laroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. It
nicks the boat. Donald looks back and the boat heads for a
cypress stand.

                    KAUFMAN
          Watch out, watch out, watch out!

Donald gets the boat back on course. Laroche and Orlean have
been left far behind. Donald slows the boat.

                    DONALD
          I think we're okay.

Suddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and
speeds along the road at the water's edge. Orlean shoots at
the boat from the van window.

                      DONALD (cont'd)
          Hold on!

Donald speeds up. The van keeps up, the shooting continues.
Bullets whiz. Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet
hits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame,
illuminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown,
along with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water,
looks all around for Kaufman.

                      DONALD (cont'd)
          Charles?!    Charles?! Where are you?

Underwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The
murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the
surface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces.

On the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water,
then get jerked back down. Donald dives.

Underwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the
leg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken
propeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs
Kaufman, and brings him to the surface.

Donald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is
fired. It skims the water near Kaufman.

                     KAUFMAN
          Fuck!   Fuck, Donald, we're dead.

                    DONALD
          We're okay. How's your leg?

                    KAUFMAN
          I don't know. How's your back.

                       DONALD
          It's fine.     My back is fine.

Laroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting.

Mike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck
and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames.

Donald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping
Kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls.

                       KAUFMAN
          Donald!

Kaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and
mangled. He lifts his brother's head onto his lap.

                    KAUFMAN
          You're gonna be okay.

                    DONALD
          No.  But don't let them get you, too.
              (weak smile)
          You got a fucking awesome third act.

                    KAUFMAN
              (crying)
          Donald, this is an awful, bizarre thing
          to say and an awful time to say it, but
          I'm sorry I didn't get to know you
          better. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

                    DONALD
          It's really... You've been really nice.

                    KAUFMAN
          See, it's just I thought I knew you
          already. I thought you were me. And I
          hated me.

Donald touches Kaufman's face. Kaufman looks at his brother.
Donald's face glows radiantly in the fire light.

                    DONALD
          Well, don't do that anymore.      Okay?

                       KAUFMAN
          Okay.

Donald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears
out of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his
brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van
follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt.

Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out
of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They
follow Kaufman into the swamp.

Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out,
surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground.

                    MIKE OWEN
          Jesus, that writer guy.

Owen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken.
He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off.

Kaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean
follow the sound of his sloshing.

                    ORLEAN
          Water sounds so sparkly. Like lemon
          plastic jewels plopping onto a silver
          trampoline! Dontcha think?

                    LAROCHE
          Darlin', please.

                    ORLEAN
          Can we fuck now, baby?    Fuck like lemons?

Owen tears along the dirt road. Up ahead, Kaufman limps out
of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused.
He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and
skids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps
over to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.

                    KAUFMAN
          You gotta help me.    You gotta help me.

                    MIKE OWEN
          What the hell is going on here?

                    KAUFMAN
          They're after me. They've got guns.
          They killed my brother.

                    MIKE OWEN
          Who's got guns? What are you --

Before Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's
body flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen
down, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in
algae-matted fur.

                       MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
          Holy shit.

The two men turn and run.

                       MIKE OWEN (cont'd)
          It's real!     I can't believe it, I never --

The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick.
Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. He
runs right into the arms of Orlean.

                    ORLEAN
          Hey, it's the screenwriter!

                    KAUFMAN
          There's a thing back there!    You don't
          want to be here.

Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back. Nothing there.

                    LAROCHE
          You're right, I don't want to be here.
          I'm tired, let's get this over with.

Laroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head. Kaufman tenses.
Orlean studies Laroche's gun. Her nose is practically
touching the barrel.

                    ORLEAN
          I love your gun, baby.    Can we trade?

                    LAROCHE
          Stand back, sweetness.

Laroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away. Suddenly
the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp.

                     LAROCHE (cont'd)
          Susie!   Susie!

Orlean looks around.

                    ORLEAN
          Where'd Johnny go?

                       LAROCHE (O.S.)
          Susie!

Orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the
darkness. Something slumps forward in the water. Orlean
steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman. The
creature is dead, so is Laroche.

                    ORLEAN
              (crying softly)
          Oh, Johnny.

She sits next to Laroche and pets his head.   Kaufman watches
her. The sun is coming up.

                    KAUFMAN
          I'd just stare at your picture, and you
          looked so sweet. I read your words and I
          thought you were smart and maybe lost and
          lonely like me. And the way you wrote
          about Laroche. You said he was handsome
          even though he had no front teeth --

                    ORLEAN
          Oh, Johnny. Johnny's teeth.     Oh...

                    KAUFMAN
          I figured you could look at me and see
          something, even with all my flaws you
          could look at me and find something, you
          could maybe someday write a description
          of me that would be nicer than the one I
          write day in and day out in my head.
              (hopefully)
          Would it be?

Kaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze
to him. She stares at him for a long while, then:

                    ORLEAN
          You're really so wonderful.

                    KAUFMAN
          Really?

                    ORLEAN
          So wonderful. I can see inside your
          soul. It glows with orange sadness.
          It's raining inside you. I want to run
          through your dripply dripples. It's so
          beautiful. I love you. I do.

Kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock.

                    KAUFMAN
          It's the drugs.

Orlean stands and walks toward Kaufman.

CONTINUED: (7)


                    ORLEAN
          No, it's me. It's the real me. Look at
          you. I just want to hold you and -- Oh,
          crap, it's wearing off. Crap!

She paces, unfolds her little square of paper.

                       ORLEAN (cont'd)
          I'm out.     I'm fucking cleaned out.

Kaufman watches her for a moment.

                       KAUFMAN
          Okay, bye.

                    ORLEAN
          I can't let you go, fatty.    I can't let
          you make this public.

Kaufman keeps walking.

                    ORLEAN (cont'd)
          You hear me? You pathetic, fat, bald...
          You don't even know how to write! You're
          not even... You're not leaving here!
              (screaming, crying)
          I need a fix! Everything's so ugly!

Orlean screams in anguish. Kaufman keeps walking. Orlean
shakily aims the gun at his back. She shoots. Kaufman
falls, gets up, keeps walking. She aims again through her
tears. Suddenly she's pounced on by a bloody, soaking wet
figure. Kaufman turns.

                       KAUFMAN
          Donald!

Kaufman limps back.    Donald and Orlean roll on the ground.

                    DONALD
          My brother is not fat. He's not bald.
          My brother is a great writer! He was
          trying to do something important!

The gun fires. Orlean slumps over Donald. Kaufman arrives.
Both Donald and Orlean are dead. Kaufman falls to his knees.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

The sun is high. Fires smoulder. A tow-truck extricates one
of the crashed vehicles. State police cars, ambulances,
ranger trucks abound. Kaufman is wrapped in a blanket.


                                                      (CONTINUED)

He is with a cop and pointing to the bodies spread on a black
plastic tarp.

                    KAUFMAN
          That's Mike Owen. John Laroche. Susan
          Orlean. I don't know what that is. I
          think it might be a Swamp Ape. And
          that's Donald, my twin brother. He saved
          my life.

Kaufman cries a little.    The cop waits sympathetically, then:

                    POLICE OFFICER
          You two really look alike.

                    KAUFMAN
              (proudly)
          Yeah. Yes, we do.

INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY

Kaufman sits in a booth, working longhand on a legal pad.
He's a little scraped-up, a little tougher. A copy of Story
by McKee is among his reference material. Alice, the
waitress, walks by and glances at the table.

                    ALICE
          Oh, I love McKee!
              (recognizes Kaufman, gets
               reserved)
          Oh, hi. Haven't seen you in a while.

                      KAUFMAN
          Hi.    Yeah, I've been away.

                    ALICE
          So you studying screenwriting?

                    KAUFMAN
          I'm actually finishing one up.

                    ALICE
          Good for you! Me too. God, it's so hard
          to get in, huh? Everyone and their
          brother is writing a screenplay.

                       KAUFMAN
             Yeah. Actually I'm writing this one for
             Sony Pictures.

                        ALICE
             Really? Wow. Really?   That's so cool.
                 (beat)
                        (MORE)

CONTINUED:
                       ALICE (cont'd)
             Wow! So what's it about, if you don't
             mind my asking?

                       KAUFMAN
             That's tough. Let's see... about being
             yourself, maybe. It's about learning
             that if you can't love yourself, you
             can't really love anyone.

                       ALICE
             That's true. God, that's so true.     It's
             such an important message, y'know?

                       KAUFMAN
             See, my twin brother was murdered
             recently --

                         ALICE
             Oh God!    I'm sorry.   That's so horrible.

                      KAUFMAN
             Thanks. Like part of me ripped away.
             Forever. It was a wake up call.

                       ALICE
             I'm so sorry. You poor man.

                       KAUFMAN
             Anyway, it helped put things in
             perspective. Life is a miracle. All
             life, from the flower to the human being.
             You. Me. And I want to show people
             that. For my brother. For everyone.

There's a pause.       Alice just stares at him, in awe.

                       ALICE
             Listen, do you mind if I sit for a sec?

                       KAUFMAN
             But you're working.

                       ALICE
                 (shrugs)
             It's a stupid job, y'know.    I'm Alice.

                         KAUFMAN
             Charlie.

                       ALICE
             I like that name. Charlie. I've always
             really liked that name. Charlie.

Alice smiles, sits.      The two of them begin to talk.

                                                         117.

     THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/6/90


     FADE IN:


A1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1

     A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an
     endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy."
     They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they
     pompously begin their umpteenth verse,
     THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past
     the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows,
     weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.

     THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF

     where the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY,
     PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler,
     gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH
     over the edge.

     AS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE


     BLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN.


                                               DISSOLVE TO:


1    INT. DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN O'CLOCK A.M.                      1


     C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --

     The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY
     HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour.
     In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a
     MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet
     and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage.
     One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward
     seven o'clock.



     IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a
     MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and
     down.
     Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop
     where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine.
     The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL
     LURCH appears and begins sweeping.
     Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the
     full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back
     of the clock.
     Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall.

     LOW TRACKING SHOT

     follows Thing along the hallway.

     He runs past a couple of doors, past a pair of LEGS in
     pajamas, feet in bedroom slippers. He skids to a halt
     and BACK TRACKS to the legs. He pulls on the cuff of
     the pajama bottoms. They belong to GOMEZ, who stands
     in the doorway to

A2   INT. FESTER'S ROOM                                         A2

     Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas.
     Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar.
     Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment,
     he radiates unfathomable woe.

                              GOMEZ

                Think of it, Thing. He's been gone
                for twenty-five years. For twenty-
                five years we've attempted to
                contact Fester in the great
                beyond...
     The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine
     to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the
     doorway.
     The room has remained untouched since Fester's
     disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust
     and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth
     - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports
     trophies, a high school photo with all the other students
     keeping as much distance from Fester as possible.
     As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:

                              GOMEZ

                ... And for twenty-five years,
                nothing. Not a whisper, not a
                clue. I'm beginning to think my
                my brother truly is lost.
     Gomez sighs.   Thing TUGS at his cuff, pulling him towards
     the

B2   INT. HALLWAY - SAME TIME                                   B2

     Galloping ahead of Gomez, Thing leaps onto an
     old-fashioned door latch and the door swings open INTO

2    INT. GOMEZ AND MORTICIA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME              2

     Gomez approaches the bed.   Asleep on scarlet satin sheets
     is...

     MORTICIA

                      (gazing at Morticia)
               Look at her -- I would die for her.
               I would kill for her. Either way
               -- what bliss.
     Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles
     are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is
     offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair
     is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry
     and remote, she's a ruined beauty.
     Morticia OPENS HER EYES.

                             GOMEZ

                      (adoringly)
               Unhappy, darling?

     Pugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized
     chemistry set.
     The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's
     collected -- "Bridge Out!", "Detour! Excavation Ahead!",
     "Dangerous Undertow!", "Keep Clear! High Voltage!"
     SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked
     in the corner.



     In another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING

     FISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA.

     This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has
     every chance of growing up to be the public monster his
     parents would be proud of.
     He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin-
     ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down.
     He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma-
     tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he
     crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

     Solemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black
     hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool
     among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A

     STRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR.

     The trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head
     through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in
     the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in.
     Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string.

                             WEDNESDAY

               Thank you, Grandmama.
     In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic.




                             GRANNY

               You kids are going to have to kill
               your own breakfast this morning.
     Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted
     human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a
     collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in
     the box.

     Gomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly
     drapes herself across his chest, she is caught in a
     sudden shaft of sunlight. She squints. On the bedside
     table beside her, Morticia's OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS

     ORCHID WILTS.





                             MORTICIA

               Gomez... the sun... il me perce

     He kisses his way up to her neck, then, suddenly
     bursting with enthusiasm and a sense of purpose, LEAPS
     from the bed, drawing his bedside saber from its sheath
     and BRANDISHING it at the offending beam.

                            GOMEZ

              En garde monsieur sole!
     He thrusts and parries, pantomiming a duel with the
     shaft of light.

              You were like some desperate,
              howling demon. You frightened me.

      its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and
      Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be
      startled by "Gate."
      Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered
      grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent.
      High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap-
      pointed in Tully than he is in himself.
      Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes
      through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the
      end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat.

      Morticia is looking for her children. She discovers
      Pugsley ASLEEP, curled up on the SILVER PLATTER WHERE THE
      TWO-HEADED PIG LAY. She finds this enchanting.
      Gomez enters.   Morticia shushes him; she points to the
      platter.

      Pugsley wakes up; he looks around.

      Gomez rallies the family for the search. Morticia wears
      a black cloak. Granny has grabbed her divining rod.
      Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting
      instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map
      of the area.

               Fan out. Pugsley - head for the dung

               graves. I'll take the abyss, and
               Lurch - check the bottomless pit.

      They look up at Fester, looking down at them from
      Wednesday's window.

      sitting in an armchair, basking in the rays of sunshine
      that beam from a copy of "The Sun Also Rises." Tully

       Gomez reaches a stately mausoleum at the far end of the
       cemetery. Two proud marble vultures guard the entryway.
       Gomez lowers the uplifted claw of one of the vultures and
       the stone doors slide open. He steps into -

       Inside it is catacomb-like, filled with the bleached
       bones of the Addams dead. Gomez's torch casts shadows
       -- one of which belongs to Wednesday, curled asleep on a
       stone sarcophagus. Relieved to find her, Gomez
       approaches quietly. He doesn't want to wake her up. He
       lifts her tenderly in his arms.

      The family members TROOP to the car with their few
      possessions.

      GOMEZ

      already sits in the passenger seat of the Duesenberg, his
      coat draped over his shoulders as if he were an invalid,
      his head thrown back.
      Morticia carries out Cleo, her carnivorous plant. Granny
      carries her favorite cauldron, Wednesday one of her Marie
      Antoinette dolls, Pugsley his chemistry set. Lurch uproots
      his favorite tree and joins the procession. Thing follows,
      dragging a toy wagon packed with his rings, his glove.

      The Duesenberg eases out of the driveway and onto the

      FESTER

      standing at a second story window, watches the car drive
      off.

      The Addams' Duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest
      cabin. The asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and
      Lurch's tree is parked next to the Addams' new home.

      Morticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer,
      she deftly makes a large spidery CRACK in the round mirror.
      Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork.
      Granny joins her.

      Her mother pats her consolingly.

                Just as long as we're together,
                n'est pas, mon cher?
      As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow
      -- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated
      plastic and orange shag carpet.

      GOMEZ

      sits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga-
      hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has
      been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back
      at her as if he's   never heard French.

                Huh?
      Wednesday tends to him.    She and her mother exchange a
      worried look.

      PUGSLEY

      comes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel
      soap.

                              PUGSLEY

                This place isn't so bad. They even
                put candy in the bathroom.

       The family moves closer to Gomez.

                 But maybe I'll have one of those...
       He takes a bar of soap from Pugsley.     Gomez unwraps it
       and morosely eats.

       SCREAMS in horror, turns to challenge the perpetrator of

      Morticia is telling a story to a group of TODDLERS, who
      have gathered in a circle around her, sitting on carpet
      squares. The room is sunny and cheerful, with crayon
      drawings taped to the walls.

                             MORTICIA

               ... and so the witch lured Hansel
               and Gretel into the candy house,
               by promising them more sweets. And
               she told them to look in the oven,
               and she was about to push them in,
               when, low and behold, Hansel pushed
               the poor, defenseless witch into the
               oven instead. Where she was burned
               alive, writhing in agony. Now,
               boys and girls, what do you think
               that feels like?
      After a beat, all the toddlers begin to CRY and WAIL.

       Morticia, seated on the edge of the box spring, tries to

       junk food wrappers, bags and styrofoam containers.
       Ritually, as handmaidens, Morticia brings Gomez the

       copy of TV Guide.
       Pugsley brings Gomez a bag of "Doritos", and Lurch brings
       him a canister of "Pringles".



       Gomez uses the remote to switch channels.   An episode of
       "The Cosby Show" comes on.

               Mrs. Addams - any thoughts?

               Despite everything, I don't hate
               you. I pity you. Persecution,
               fiendish torture, inhuman depravity -
               sometimes it's just not enough.

               I'd love to, you know that, but -
               I've got this stomach thing. When I
               torture people. It's just me.

      Tully shuts his eyes and tightens the rack. Morticia's
      bones make a horrible POPPING, STRETCHING SOUND. She
      MOANS, rather sensually.

                               ABIGAIL

               Again!
      Tully tightens the rack again. More BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS again, even more orgasmically.

                               ABIGAIL

               Tighter!
      Tully tightens the rack a third time. BONE-POPPING NOISES.
      Morticia MOANS, very voluptuously. She opens her eyes.
      She sighs, in afterglow. She glances at Tully.

                             MORTICIA

                      (to Tully, flirtatiously)
               You've done this before.

      He helps her down from the wheel.

                             GOMEZ

               Leather straps, red-hot pokers...

                             MORTICIA

               Later, my dearest.
      ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.

                             ABIGAIL

               Keep the book closed, Gordon -
               listen to mother!

                             FESTER

               I'll never listen to you - not
               ever again!

                             ABIGAIL

               I had to be strict with you -
               because I cared! Put it down!

                             FESTER

               You never really loved me!
      ANGLE on Gomez and Morticia, nearing the bookcase.

                             GOMEZ

               Come, my love - to safety!

                             MORTICIA

               But what of Fester?

                 Old man, this way!
       ANGLE on Abigail and Fester.

                               ABIGAIL

                 Stop whining, you little good-
                 for-nothing! Be a man!

                               FESTER

                 You're a terrible mother!   There,
                 I said it!
       Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window.
       Then he blasts Abigail out as well.
       ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed",
       to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading
       Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the
       bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale
       force winds.

                               GOMEZ

                        (calling out to Fester)
                 Old man! This way!
       ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the
       floor toward the bookshelf. Thing fights the wind,
       which pelts him with papers and other flying debris.
       Gomez can no longer fight the storm, and the bookshelf
       slams shut. Fester desperately tries to close the book to
       quell the storm, but a HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ZAPS HIM.
       He falls to the floor, with electricity coursing through
       him.



       MOVE IN on the storm raging within the pages of the book,
       then -

174   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION, NEXT OCTOBER - NIGHT                174

      A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There
      is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN
      OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional
      Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton,
      etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle
      and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and
      he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the
      children CHANT:

                             CHILDREN

               Trick or...
      They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened
      the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM
      IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.




                                                  CUT TO:

175   INT. FRONT HALL - SAME TIME                               175

      Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled.
      The family is busily decorating the house for their annual
      Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant
      yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the
      chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o-
      lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from
      the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are
      clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with
      cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters
      and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe
      paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each
      holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and
      the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans
      against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat.
      A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the
      letters drip with blood.
      Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony.   Morticia hands
      him a decoration.
      Granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.

                             GRANNY

               Well, it's their loss. I even
               made finger sandwiches.
      Perched on Fester's shoulder, Thing shakes in fear.

                             FESTER

                      (petting Thing)
               Oh, calm down.

                               PUGSLEY (O.S.)

               Here we come!



      Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday
      is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as
      a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND
      GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down
      onto his feet.

                             GOMEZ

               Pugsley, old man!

                             MORTICIA

                      (delighted)
               Look at you.

                             PUGSLEY

                      (to Uncle Fester)
               How do you like it?
      Fester is very touched; he picks Pugsley up.

               Oh yes - in the den.

      Everyone starts to move toward the den. There is a KNOCK
      on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the door.
      Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is
      dressed as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin
      It wears a cowboy hat, a bandanna and a holster. Margaret
      is radiant, obviously very much in love.

                             MARGARET

               Trick or treat!

               Hello, Margaret. Cousin It - I
               almost didn't recognize you.

                             MARGARET

               Isn't he handsome? Everyone keeps
               asking where he bought his costume.

                             GOMEZ

                      (admiringly)
               It is a wonderful hat.

               And what are you, darling?   Where's
               your costume?

                             WEDNESDAY

                      (solemnly)
               This is my costume. I'm a homicidal
               maniac. They look just like everyone
               else.

      Fester and Pugsley are posed at one end of the room.
      Lurch has set up an easel and canvas; he is painting
      Fester and Pugsley's portrait.
      Gomez and Wednesday are sitting on the floor amid
      newspapers, carving a pumpkin.
      Morticia is knitting. Margaret and Cousin It sit together,
      holding hands. Granny brings people cups of steaming
      punch, from a punch bowl.

               Halloween - it's such a special
               time. Ghosts and goblins. Witches
               on broomsticks.

               Children begging in the streets.

               I'm so glad I can share this night
               with my family - my real family.
               Now that I've got my memory back.

               You remember, old sport - she really
               did find him tangled in a tuna net,
               twenty-five years ago. With amnesia.

      Gomez.




                             FESTER

               My own dear brother - who could be
               more precious?

                             GOMEZ

               Blood is thicker than water, old man.

                             MORTICIA

                      (touched by the
                       brothers devotion)
               And just as refreshing.
      Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly
      handshake.

                             GOMEZ

               Let us never be parted.

                             FESTER

               Let us always be as one.



      Fester flips Gomez in a JUDO FLIP.
      Gomez LANDS -
      At the foot of a glass display case. The camera pans up
      the case. It contains ABIGAIL AND TULLY, EXPERTLY

      MOUNTED AND STUFFED.

      Fester rises, dusting himself off.

                             FESTER

                      (joyfully, to Gomez
                       and Morticia)
               Come on!

                             MORTICIA

               We'll catch up.
      Fester runs out.

                                                 CUT TO:





      THE ADDAMS FAMILY - 3/18/91                           115-117.


177   OMITTED                                                    177





178   INT. FRONT HALL                                            178

      Everyone is gone. Morticia and Gomez have drifted into
      the front hall; they are moving toward the front door.

                              MORTICIA

                       (deeply satisfied)
                Our family... what are they?

                              GOMEZ

                Oh, Tish - what a night. Everyone
                -- together at last. What more
                could we ask?




                             MORTICIA

                Gomez?
      Morticia holds up the garment she's been knitting - it's
      a BABY JUMPER WITH THREE LEGS.

                              GOMEZ

                       (ecstatic)
                Cara mia... is it true?

                              MORTICIA

                       (shaking her head
                        "yes")
                Oui, mon cher...
      They embrace, as the front door SWINGS OPEN, of its own
      accord.

                                                CUT TO:


179   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION - SAME TIME                            179




      Morticia and Gomez are silhouetted in the doorway. There
      is a FULL MOON. In the distance, a wolf HOWLS. Wispy
      GHOSTS flit through the night sky. A human SCREAM is
      heard, followed by Granny's CACKLE. In the cemetery,
      torches are seen, like fireflies.




                                                FADE OUT.

		Re:  Project Sawtooth

FADE IN:

EXT.  SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY	1

Beside a 1950 Ford, a quartet of elite intellectuals poses 
playfully...dressed in the local custom of boots and cowboy hats, the 
TOW ORIENTAL MEN, A CAUCASIAN MAN, AND A CAUCASIAN WOMAN squint into 
the hot sun and then down at the jiggling home movie camera, the 
operator lopsided...

NARRATOR
The advent of the Soviet nuclear capability ushers in a dangerous phase 
of the Cold War as the decade of the 1950s looms.  Stung by this Soviet 
challenge and the rapid race to develop ever more sophisticated 
weapons, the United States resurrects maverick Professor Toichi 
Hikita's work in electromagnetic particle acceleration...despite the 
dismal record of failure that has dogged the project.

TOICHI HIKITA, one of the group, walks forward, taking the CAMERA from 
its present operator, a four-year-old child...A LITTLE BOY IN CHAPS AND 
COWBOY HAT who now joins the other adults, in particular Caucasian 
woman and the elder Oriental man who pick him up and hug him...

NARRATOR
Doctor Masado Banzai, preeminent Japanese quantum theorist, declares 
himself anxious to work for the Allies.  Enamored of the great American 
West, Banzai sires a precocious son and tags the tiny child "Buckaroo."  
A tribute to his adopted homeland.

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	2

A strange TWO-MAN SPEED VEHICLE readies for takeoff...the FIRST "PILOT" 
in the cockpit Dr. Banzai himself:

NARRATOR
And thus given a second chance after his secret pre-war laboratory 
disaster at Princeton, Doctor Hikita finds new life at the Texas School 
of Mines, where he assembles a team of crack scientists willing to 
gamble he's right in his bold assertion that man can indeed pass 
unharmed through solid matter.

The SECOND "PILOT," a fair-haired Caucasian:	3

NARRATOR
Sir Alan Motley of Cambridge, a brainy, affable limey, co-developer 
with Whitehead and Lord Russell of the world's most advanced 
theoretical gravity catapult...

	4
The fourth scientist, the female Caucasian, busy with last-minute 
details, securing the two pilots in their seats, checking their 
instrument data, writing on a clipboard...

NARRATOR
Dr. Sandra Banzai, Texas-born pioneer in Negative Mass Propulsion 
...wife of Dr. Masado Banzai.

...as the four-year-old BUCKAROO BANZAI now approaches the speed 
machine and gives his father a good-bye kiss...Dr. Banzai saying 
something to the boy, Buckaroo bowing respectfully, as his father and 
mother exchange last-minute assurances...

The cockpit canopy comes down, and Sandra Banzai tugs a reluctant 
little Buckaroo toward a sandbagged shelter...

EXT.  SANDBAGS - DAY	5

...where Professor Hikita sits at a bank of monitoring equipment, 
Sandra Banzai and Buckaroo entering the enclosure as...

...A SUDDEN NOISE causes Sandra Banzai to turn in fear, the bizarre 
speed machine's motors whining at an astonishing rpm, BLINDING GREEN 
FLAMES ENGULFING ITS COCKPIT...

EXT.  TEST SITE - DAY	6

...Sandra Banzai rushing toward the sheet-metal vehicle through SMOKE 
AND GREEN FLAME as her husband and Sir Alan both struggle to get out...

	7
...Buckaroo running after his mother who attempts to help the 
scientists free themselves when suddenly the child is thrown to the 
ground and protected by Professor Hikita's own body...as the 
experimental car VAPORIZES IN A FLASH OF EMERALD GREEN LIGHT!  THE 
SCREEN GOING WHITE, A LAUNCH COUNTDOWN BEGINNING UNDER A SOMBER CARD:

TODAY
THIRTY YEARS LATER

VOICE OF MISSION CONTROL
T Minus five hundred and counting.  Phaser positive.  Latch compressor.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	8

CLOSE ON AN OLDER, WISER PROFESSOR HIKITA:

PROF. HIKITA
Power source output, zero-zero-niner.  Multi-stage axial compressor 
latched.

EXT.  JET CAR - PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	9

One hundred yards from a concrete blockhouse, a SERIES OF MYSTERIOUS 
CLOSEUPS of an UNUSUAL STRATEGIC AUTOMOBILE sitting ready to roll, as 
TECHNICIANS in asbestos suites fill its tanks with HIGHLY FLAMMABLE 
FUEL.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	10

PROF. HIKITA
Fuel pressure, 1800 torrs.  Oxygenation.

...amid television screens, monitoring devices...an elite assortment of 
GOVERNMENT VIPS, MILITARY MEN, AND NEWS MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES standing 
by...

	11
...one such observer, GENERAL CATBURD, an AIDE approaching, whispering 
unpleasant news in his ear...

GENERAL CATBURD
You're kidding. Where is he?  Still in the hospital? 

The aide shrugging, the General leaning over to a nervous man sitting 
next to him...SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY.

GENERAL CATBURD
Banzai hasn't showed yet, Mr. Secretary. Looks like he's got cold feet.

Another angle.  Two of Buckaroo's men, RENO and PERFECT TOMMY, sitting 
with their boots on a computer console.

PERFECT TOMMY
Better see what's keepin' the boss, Reno.

RENO
Why me?

...an attractive NETWORK TV ANCHORWOMAN headed this way...

PERFECT TOMMY
'Cause I'm busy.  And get your clodhoppers off the UNIVAC.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	13

THE EYES OF DOCTOR BUCKAROO BANZAI, THE REST OF HIS FACE HIDDEN BY A 
SURGICAL MASK...such concentration.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	14

...a phone ringing, a NURSE answering it, then:

NURSE
Rawhide, it's for you.

Jacketless, A SINISTER PISTOL visible in the tooled leather shoulder 
holster, RAWHIDE takes the receiver.

RAWHIDE
I'll ask him.
(into his Go-Fone)
Buckaroo, I need an estimate.  They're getting antsy over at Mission 
Control.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	15

Buckaroo Banzai speaks into his GO-FONE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another ten minutes down here, Rawhide.

REVEALING DOCTOR BANZAI, the great surgeon, surrounded by a well-oiled 
team of physicians and nurses...his steady, miraculously skilled hands 
working a LASER KNIFE on the brain of a PATIENT sitting clamped in a 
serious chair.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	16

RAWHIDE
(into phone)
The chief needs ten more minutes.  I got the chopper waiting.  Don't 
start without us.

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	17

Perfect Tommy still leaning back in his swivel chair, smiling at the 
blonde TV anchorwoman, waiting for her CAMERAMAN to set up...

TV ANCHORWOMAN
So where's Buckaroo?

PERFECT TOMMY
(a wry smile)
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?

The anchorwoman catching his drift, smiling, knowing Perfect Tommy 
perhaps intimately...Perfect Tommy glancing across the crowded room at 
Reno raising ten fingers...

PERFECT TOMMY
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you 
doing tonight?

TV ANCHORWOMAN
(picking up his hat)
Flying to Cambodia.

Perfect Tommy frowning severely as she tried on his Stetson, the 
anchorwoman promptly getting the message and putting it back down.

PERFECT TOMMY
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I 
hadda kill you.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Bet I do.

INT.  SURGICAL SCRUB ROOM - DAY	18

Another STAR SURGEON, scrubbing for an operation next door now peeking 
at his wrist watch TV:

CLOSE ON THE TINY TV:  AN IMAGE OF THE JET CAR...	19

ANGLE ON...	20

STAR SURGEON
Jesus Christ...how does the man find enough hours in the day?

RAWHIDE
We help.

The surgeon curious, studying the big TV monitor, Rawhide sensing an 
explanation is in order:

RAWHIDE
Dr. Banzai's using a laser to fuse artificial nerve fiber to the 
original, bypassing massive stroke damage.  A subcutaneous microphone's 
gonna allow the patient to transmit verbal instructions to his own 
brain.

STAR SURGEON
What, like "raise my left arm"?

RAWHIDE
Or "throw the harpoon," depending on cultural differences. People are 
gonna come from all over. This guy's an Eskimo.

INT.  OPERATING ROOM - DAY	21

Buckaroo winding down the surgery.  A BRILLIANT BUT ERRATIC JEWISH 
PHYSICIAN at his side whispering through a mask...

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Okay...right...okay, I see...next time I'll be able to...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There may not be a next time.

JEWISH PHYSICIAN
Look...I'm sorry...calling for help in the middle of an operation...but 
I just lost my nerve...I panicked...again.

Buckaroo picking a NIKON up off a table, snapping some pictures of his 
handiwork...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You've got the God-given tools to be a success in any field of 
endeavor, Dr. Zwibel.  Ever thought about joining me full-time?

JEWISH PHYSICIAN (DR. ZWIBEL)
Are you serious?  Have you have an opening?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can you sing?

DR. ZWIBEL
A little. I can dance.

Buckaroo glancing at the clock on the wall...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	22

PROF. HIKITA
Inertial Control positive.  T minus seven zero and resume counting.

MISSION CONTROL
All systems righteous.  Professor Hikita says we have to go.

General Catburd and other VIPS happy to observe on their TV monitors 
the sight of a MAN IN BLACK COMMANDO PARACHUTE SUIT, carrying a 
BATTERED OLD BRIEFCASE, climbing into the cockpit of...THE JET CAR.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY

THE DRIVER'S POV, a curious combination of airplane dials and switches 
and personal touches like a big four-on-the-floor gear shift and a 
snazzy pearlized Brodi knob with snowflakes and a coochi-coochi girl...

	24
ANGLE ON the driver as he removes a strange GRYOSCOPIC DEVICE from his 
briefcase, plugs it into a cradle near his head...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	25

Professor Hikita standing at a special monitor as a light pops on, 
indicating "Overthruster Armed"....he covers it with a hanky...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	26

...all quiet suddenly, the car poised, waiting...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	27

General Catburd grabbing some coffee and doughnuts...the Secretary of 
Defense peering out through a viewing slot...

GENERAL CATBURD
I've got a budget meeting on the hill, John.  What's this thing 
supposed to do anyway?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Three hundred miles an hour, General.

GENERAL CATBURD
Senator, you are so fulla shit.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
May not...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	28

The Jet Car undergoing an amazing transformation:  TWO STABILIZER FINS 
AND A JET ENGINE suddenly appearing on its rear deck...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	29

CLOSE ON THE DRIVER TO REVEAL BUCKAROO BANZAI, world famous figure in 
every field of endeavor as he withdraws a beautiful KAMIKAZE SCARF from 
his flight suit...wraps it like a warrior's headband around his 
helmet...

	30
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand as his fingers flip a row of toggle switches, 
THE PULSATING POWER OF THE JET ENGINE INCREASING DRAMATICALLY with each 
successive switch...the vehicle a caged beast, taunting us, as Buckaroo 
flips the last switch...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Final contact is made.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	31

No kidding.  A TWENTY FOOT SHEET OF FIRE ROCKETING FROM THE BACK OF THE 
JET CAR...THEN ANOTHER...THEN ANOTHER...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	32

The Cavaliers at their monitors, calm...Hikita making minor adjustments 
on his instrument bank...the Secretary of Defense and General Catburd 
both now at viewing slots in the blockhouse wall...

PROF. HIKITA
Point of no return...five, four, three, two...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	33

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
...one.

As Buckaroo Banzai twists his steering-wheel mounted TWIN ACCELERATORS, 
the sudden forward lurch of the Jet Car slamming him back against the 
headrest...

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	34

THE JET CAR BLASTING OFF!  MORE FIRE!  MORE SMOKE!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	35

Technicians and VIPS eye their monitors.

	36
AND SO DO WE:  the rugged JET CAR raising a cloud of dust, viewed from 
high above us it blasts ahead!

ANGLE ON	37

GENERAL CATBURD
Too bad war ain't Indianapolis.  It's fast, I'll give Banzai that.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Perhaps an idea whose time has come, General?  Scoot over.

Catburd moving aside as Senator Cunningham takes her turn with the 
viewing device.

GENERAL CATBURD
It'll never work.  It's too simple.

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	38

HIGH OVERHEAD, manned by a TV NEWS CREW.

	39
AN OVER-THE-CAMERAMAN'S SHOULDER POV as the JET CAR'S EXHAUST TRAIL 
CHOKES THE LANDSCAPE BELOW...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	40

BUCKAROO'S POV as the highway races underneath him...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	41

ALL EYES glued to those TV monitors, Rawhide and Reno 
watching...Perfect Tommy slapping his hand on the desk.

TV ANCHORWOMAN
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo 
able to keep that thing on the ground?

PERFECT TOMMY
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.

EXT.  PROVING GROUNDS - DAY	42

Talk about a road hugger...the JET CAR SCREAMS PAST A BANK OF HIGH 
SPEED CAMERAS...THE EARTH SHAKING...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	43

PROF. HIKITA
Approaching thirty seconds downrange Three zero.  Course steady.  Speed 
three one seven nautical-four hundred...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's gonna do it!  The man is gonna do it!

GENERAL CATBURD
So what?  Big deal.  Anybody can drive fast in a straight line.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	44

...as if in response to Catburd's comment, Buckaroo does an amazing 
thing, NOW FLICKING HIS DIRECTIONAL SIGNAL...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	45

LEAVING THE PAVED SURFACE FOR OPEN TERRAIN!  BEGIN INTERCUTTING 
BLOCKHOUSE AND JET CAR...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	46

A FIRE breaking out on a dashboard gauge, Buckaroo quickly snuffing the 
SPARKS with his gloved hand...DANGER LIGHTS FLASHING!

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	47

...as AWESOME PHYSICAL PRESSURES take their tool on car and driver...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	48

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, do you read?

MISSION CONTROL
Advise you abort.  Over.  Repeat: advise abort.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	49

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's a big "no can do".

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE- DAY	50

Buckaroo's voice through STATIC AND CRACKLE.  Professor Hikita white-
knuckled...determined.

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	51

Buckaroo STILL ACCELERATING, struggling with his mighty 
machine...fierce vibrations, OIL AND SMOKE filling the cockpit...as he 
wipes hot oil off his goggles...

INT.  HELICOPTER - DAY	52

In the NETWORK HELICOPTER, a NEWSMAN and CAMERMAN catch this shocking 
turn of events:

	53
THEIR POV OF...the JET CAR flaming along across the desert.  A SONIC 
BOOM!

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	54

A TV MONITOR...A HELICOPTER SHOT revealing that the course thus far 
traveled by Buckaroo is ON FIRE, the ground literally set ablaze by the 
incredible speed of his JET CAR:

ANGLE ON:	55

TV ANCHORWOMAN
The Jet Car off the road!  Radio contact with Mission Control here 
severed...that firestorm apparently interfering with 
communications...Buckaroo Banzai in serious trouble.

GENERAL CATBURD
Either that or he's popped his cookies.

Professor Hikita, on pins and needles, face taught, concerned.

MISSION CONTROL
Mach 1.  Buckaroo!  Do you read?  Commence braking procedure!  Over!

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
He's heading for the goddamn mountains!

MISSION CONTROL
Eject, Buckaroo! EJECT!

Buckaroo heard faintly in a STORM OF NOISE...SPEAKING JAPANESE...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Professor Hikita, what'd he say?

PROF. HIKITA
(quizzical)
He said, "This Bud's for you, Professor."  What does that mean?

	56
ON THE MONITORS the JET CAR is seen heading directly into a box canyon 
and TOWARD A WALL OF MOUNTAINS, impact virtually assured.

ANGLE ON:	57

GENERAL CATBURD
Looks like Banzai's finally gonna get more than he bargained for.  And 
take the friends of the Earth with him.

Rawhide and Reno exchanging very concerned glances...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	58

Buckaroo Banzai peers out his thick glass window.

BUCKAROO'S POV:  THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN CLOSING FAST...	59

	60
ANGLE ON Buckaroo's hand moving to a switch on the dash marked

	63
BUCKAROO'S POV...THE FACE OF THE MOUNTAIN RUSHING UP INTO FRAME!  
COLLISION A PICO SECOND AWAY!

ANGLE ON:	66

MISSION CONTROL
It's off my scope!

GENERAL CATBURD
What the devil?  What is going on?!

INT.  JET CAR	67

BUCKAROO'S COCKPIT POV... like a roller coaster ride through a meteor 
shower - THE EIGHTH DIMENSION, AN ORGANIC ASTEROID HURTLING RIGHT AT US 
EMITTING STRANGE STATIC ELECTRICAL CHARGES...MONSTROUS...RED...GHASTLY!

	68
REVERSE ANGLE.  Looking directly at Buckaroo as his face distorts under 
God-knows-how-many G-forces...where the hell is he?!  His plexiglas 
visor shattering as if hit with a two-by-four.

COCKPIT POV...Buckaroo's windshield CRACKLING AND THE COCKPIT TURNING 
RED.	69

	70
CLOSE ON DASHBOARD: wildly spinning dials, Buckaroo punching the

INT.  HELICOPTER - TEST RANGE - DAY	71

The TV crew in their fancy helicopter first to witness an astounding 
sight.

	72
THEIR POV: the JET CAR EMERGING FROM SOLID ROCK AS THOUGH THE CRAGGY 
MOUNTAIN WERE MUSH!

CLOSE ON:	73

HELICOPTER NEWSMAN
(in apoplexy)
He's through it!  He's gone through the mountain without a scratch!  
Oh, my God!  Oh, my God in Heaven!

Fifty miles downrange, Buckaroo tries to slow the speeding, smoke-
filled JET CAR.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	76

A parachute popping out its back, at once ripping off in the high 
velocity wind...

INT.  JET CAR - DAY	77

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Chute negative.  I'm gonna try and lay her sideways.

78	
ANOTHER ANGLE as he reaches for the hand brake and simultaneously spins 
his Brodi knob hard to the right!

EXT.  MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY	79

Buckaroo doing the impossible, somehow bringing the racing JET CAR to a 
spinning, skidding halt in a thicket of dry brush!  AS OVERHEAD THAT 
NETWORK HELICOPTER CIRCLES...

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	80

The battered JET CAR, exhausting smoke, Buckaroo rolling its window 
down, opening the door and emerging, checking the damage to his 
vehicle, noting a STRANGE GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE on the cracked 
windshield, touching it and turning his nose from the smell...his glove 
steaming!

THE NEWS COPTER LANDING IN THE DISTANCE.	81

	82
ANGLE ON Buckaroo as he lowers himself under the Jet Car, coming face-
to-face with one ugly SPHERICAL PARASITE, THE THING SUDDENLY SHOOTING 
OUT at Buckaroo as he's about to touch it...A MOBILE PHONE starting to 
BEEP back in the cockpit...the PARASITE coming to rest on the 
ground...dead?

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	83

Pandemonium, people cheering...General Catburd on the phone...

GENERAL CATBURD
This his frequency?  Nobody's home.

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	84

Buckaroo ignoring the phone, taking his lunch bag from the front seat 
and removing a sandwich, taking a bite of it, and using the foil to 
pick up the BIZARRE PARASITE from the desert floor...wrapping the weird 
thing up...now at last reaching for the car phone...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	85

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(Taking the phone)
Gimme that!  You tell me, Buckaroo, what in the hell is this going-
through-solid-matter-and rendering-all-conventional-defense-perimeters-
useless-over-night bullshit?

But now Professor Hikita snatching the phone from the Secretary, 
turning his back to the room!

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  Did you seem them?  Did you?

EXT.  JET CAR - DAY	86

Buckaroo leaning in to check his gauges, talking on his telephone.  TWO 
FIGURES from the news copter approaching, still a hundred yards off...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast.  
Broke my windshield...

INT.  BLOCKHOUSE - DAY	87

PROF. HIKITA
(into phone)
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?

GENERAL CATBURD
Creatures?
(grabbing the phone)
Buckaroo, Catburd here.  I got egg all over my face, but that's okay.  
No room for egos here.  We're all Americans and I wanna buy that thing 
of yours.  What's it gonna run me?

PROF. HIKITA
Not for sale.

GENERAL CATBURD
I wasn't talking to you, Hikita san.

...as the Secretary of Defense picks up a RED PHONE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
This'll be the President of me?

Perfect Tommy and Reno suddenly stepping forward, intimidating 
Catburd...

PERFECT TOMMY
She's not for sale, right, General?

INT.  HOME FOR CRIMINALLY INSANCE - DAY	88

CLOSE ON the haunting, unsettling eyes of DOCTOR LIZARDO, AN ORANGE-
HAIRED OLD MAN watching NETWORK FOOTAGE of the Jet Car Test on his 
battered Philco TV set...his eyes practically burning a whole through 
the screen...

...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a room in an insane asylum, a room designed 
for several inmates but occupied by only one, this crazy old 
fiend...the empty beds piled with books and Italian memorabilia, the 
walls covered with mathematical equations...

	89
ANGLE ON Dr. Lizardo even now unable to resist scribbling another 
formula on the wall with a piece of chalk...

CLOSE ON PHILCO:	90

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Here she is, slowed down.  Lookit there...slam!  Right into the side of 
that mountain!  Perfect Tommy, Rawhide, Reno, you guys're the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers. Buckaroo's most trusted inner circle.  So I gotta ask, did 
it surprise you fellas as much as the rest of us when the BJV, the 
experimental jet vehicle went right off the scope and apparently smack 
into a black void?

PERFECT TOMMY ON TV
Nope.

ANCHORWOMAN ON TV
Was Buckaroo acting different this morning, I mean, in terms of other 
mornings?

The Cavaliers rolling their eyes, looking at one another...

RAWHIDE ON TV
Well, we partied pretty late last night.

	91
BACK TO Dr. Lizardo now hearing footsteps outside in the corridor, and 
HIS LEFT AHND, ACTING INDEPENDENTLY OF HIS RIGHT, ERASES THE EQUATION 
HE'S JUST WRITTEN...as his right hand reaches under his pillow and 
picks up a crude HOMEMADE ELECTROMAGNET...a piece of metal wrapped in 
copper wire, one end of which is a small loop that Lizardo now attaches 
directly to his thumbs...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(muttering)
The Overthruster! The Overthruster! 

Lizardo looking back at his equation, at first puzzled to find it 
erased, then becoming angry.

	92
CLOSE ON HIS HAND NOW STICKING THE OTHER END OF HIS HOME-MADE DEVICE 
DIRECTLY INTO AN ELECTIRCAL SOCKET...

ANGLE ON:	93

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(obsessed)
The Overthruster! 

ELECTRICAL CURRENT COURSING THROUGH LIZARDO'S BODY...AN AURA 
SURROUNDING HIM AS HIS LIPS CURL INTO A HIDEOUS SMILE...BURNING THE 
SCREEN, TAKING US INTO AN ASTOUNDING FLASHBACK SEQUENCE:

INT.  STRANGE LABORATORY - NIGHT	94

Forty-six years prior (years before the ill-fated primitive speed car 
run involving Buckaroo's parents) an unlikely experiment in a strange 
factory...A RUNWAY...a much younger, dark-haired Doctor Lizardo being 
strapped into a homemade wicker chair/rocket sled by two LAB 
ASSISTANTS, the entire contraption set up like a catapult AIMED 
DIRECTLY AT A LOSID BRICK WALL, THROBBING ELECTROMAGNETS AND BANKS OF 
GLOWING OSCILLATORS...

	95
ANOTHER ANGLE...and peering into an unusual periscope, an equally 
JUVENILE PROFESSOR HIKITA wearing glasses and scraggly 
goatee...standing in front of a 1938 calendar on the wall, today's 
eagerly awaited date circled in red...

PROF. HIKITA
Almost ready, Dr. Lizardo...almost...

Doctor Lizardo pulling on a leather helmet, Professor Hikita nodding 
grimly at the LAB ASSISTANTS who tug on a GIANT LEVER...the 
ELECTROMAGNETS PULSATING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
More!  More!

PROF. HIKITA
Not so fast...

	96
ANGLE ON Doctor Lizardo pulling a switch, UNLEASHING HIS WICKER CHAIR 
AT A FANTASTIC SPEED down the rails!

	97
AT THE END OF THE TRACK...the strange device coming to an abrupt and 
total stop ten feet from the brick wall, pitching Lizardo forward 
and...

	98
...through the wall, at least partially, the seemingly solid bricks 
turning out to be more like vertical QUICKSAND...Lizardo half in, half 
out, physically unhurt but screaming his head off...

	99
...the assistants rushing down the runway to help pry him loose, while 
Professor Hikita observes an astonishing thing through his periscope.

	100
PERISCOPE POV:  HUGE GROTESQUE RED CREATURES IN AN AURA OF ELECTRICITY 
TRYING TO PULL DOCTOR LIZARDO TOWARD THEM...ONE CREATURE IN PARTICULAR 
ENVELOPING LIZARDO!

	101
BACK TO...the doctor's assistants frantically tugging on his feet, 
dragging him back into the room only to find this SUDDENLY ORANGE-
HAIRED LIZARDO a fearsome, changed individual...a beast!

	102
CLOSE ON LIZARDO!  A terrifying scream issues from his mouth as he 
straightens up, at last wrenching free of the wicker chair, smashing 
his two assistants' heads together as he jumps over the runway!  Hikita 
watching wild-eyed as Lizardo makes a mad dash into the vast shadowy 
expanse of the factory...

	103
A DISTANT VIEW OF LIZARDO as he rips a door off its hinges, escaping 
into the night, SILHOUTTED AGAINST A DAZZLING SECURITY LIGHT, THE 
SCREEN BURNING WHITE...OUR FLASHBACK ENDING.

INT.  LIZARDO'S ROOM - NIGHT	104

Nearly half a century later, the elderly Lizardo regards with 
smoldering evil the turn of the key in his own door and the appearance 
of a GUARD who comes in and unplugs his TV set.

GUARD
Cheer up, Lizardo, it's Friday.  I come for your TV.  You been using 
too damn much juice...ten thousand kilowatts again this month.  Beats 
me how one old homicidal loony could use that much power.

The guard leaving with Lizardo's TV...Lizardo trying to control 
himself, his eyes rolling up at the ceiling where yet another UNUSUAL 
EQUATION has been scrawled in an angry hand.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my TV...don't take my TV...I want it.  I want the Overthruster.  
I want it.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT	105

Mysterious half-light...CLOSEUPS...plugs and jacks...a portion of an 
upright base...drums with the BANZAI LOGO writ large...hands and feet 
putting everything together as an unseen audience stirs restlessly...

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT	106

Backstage in a small dressing room, the rock band known as the Hong 
Kong Cavaliers waits to go on...three unidentified GROUPIES in 
attendance as Rawhide naps and Reno tunes his saxophone while Perfect 
Tommy answers the questions of a FEMALE REPORTER from the local 
underground press...

Professor Hikita meantime at a corner table, studying his big notebook, 
examining a pair of KODAK SLIDES...

...as there is the sound of a commotion in the corridor, EXCITED VOICES 
and FOOT TRAFFIC coming this way, Rawhide methodically counting down 
under his Stetson:

RAWHIDE
Five...four...three...two...one.

	107
The door to the dressing room opening precisely on the count of one, 
admitting an out-of-breath and hastily tuxedoed Buckaroo Banzai, A 
SMALL CROWD OF ASSORTED FEMAL FANS locked outside.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm starving...somebody, help.

RAWHIDE
Got a half a tuna sandwich.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Same one you had yesterday?

Rawhide taking a half-eaten sandwich out of his hat and tossing it to 
Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Smells fermented.
(taking a big bite)
Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, I've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen 
you pulled off the Jet Car drive shaft.

RENO
And there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that 
crack in her windshield.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Figures.  Anybody seen my scope?

PERFECT TOMMY
Coming right up, Buckaroo.

Perfect Tommy producing a highly sophisticated SLIDE VIEWER...Buckaroo 
slipping in a transparency.

	108
HIS POV OF A COLORFUL PRISMATIC GRAPH over the backdrop of A NAKED 
WOMAN.

	109
Buckaroo immediately diagnosing the problem and removing the naked-
woman slide from the viewer...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Anybody we know?

PERFECT TOMMY
Who put this dirty picture in Buckaroo's viewer?

Rawhide reclaiming his raunchy slide, Buckaroo looking back into the 
sleek device...

PROF. HIKITA
I ran it through the centrifuge, but I came up blank.  It's definitely 
dead now, although it still conducts electricity even better than 
copper does.

PERFECT TOMMY
Super performance organic material.

PROF. HIKITA
Yes, Perfect Tommy, in a way.  However...
(slipping in another slide)
...notice...although certain components resist identification, it 
corresponds very closely to an ordinary praying mantis.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(scrutinizing)
Too closely.  Gotta be more than sheer coincidence.  Rawhide, you're 
keen on bugs.  What do you think?

Rawhide takes a look as Reno hangs the phone up...

RENO
Everything's copacetic at the Institute, Buckaroo.  Sam's with the Jet 
Car and she's under lock and key.  He's retiming her valves.

Buckaroo nodding, as he's interrupted by Perfect Tommy who's now 
brought over the female reporter...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, you got a minute--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not really.  This is pretty important.

PERFECT TOMMY
She wants a picture.

Perfect Tommy quickly taking a place beside Buckaroo, smiling into the 
camera, as Reno and Rawhide exchange disgusted looks...

	110
...the shutter clicking...another commotion in the hallway...the 
dressing room door opening to admit the club owner, ARTIE DUNCAN, a 
fifty-year-old rocker who has to struggle to close the door behind him 
on a herd of REPORTERS and FANS...

ARTIE DUNCAN
I don't care who you are...when you play my joint, you're just another 
band. I want some music outta you characters.

RENO 
You want it, Artie? You got it.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?

PERFECT TOMMY
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.

A pair of no-nonsense BLUE SHIELD IRREGULARS appearing to escort them 
on-stage...as Rawhide returns the spectroscope to Professor Hikita...

RAWHIDE
No question about it.  Something very akin to arachnoid tissue.  If I 
hadda guess?  A mutated species.

INT.  BACKSTAGE - NIGHT	111

Buckaroo, the Hong Kong Cavaliers, and their two Blue Shield escorts 
hustling down a corridor.

INT.  NIGHTCLUB STAGE - NIGHT	112

Our boys arriving on stage...SHADOWY FORMS in the dramatically murky 
light...a FAMILIAR VOICE BOOMING OVER THE P.A. SYSTEM...

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Ladies and gentlemen, Artie's Artery is proud to present, for one night 
only...the one, the only, the amazing Buckaroo Banzai and his Hong Kong 
Cavaliers!

LIGHTS UP!  AND A WAVE OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED ROCK 'N' ROLL CRASHES OUT 
ON THE AUDIENCE, Buckaroo on lead guitar, joining the Hong Kong 
Cavaliers in a number so primal your feet just won't sit still!

	113
...while at the rear of the room, seated by herself, we find an 
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG LADY...crying, for some reason exempt from the general 
raucous good will.  She pours herself another drink, but booze won't do 
the job.  She's all alone.  She needs some help.  Her name is PENNY 
PRIDDY.

	114
On-stage Buckaroo Banzai suddenly stops moving, stops singing and waves 
the Cavaliers to cease as well.  EERIE STILLNESS, the only sound 
Buckaroo's lips on the silver mike.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I heard somebody crying.
(no response)
I said is someone out there crying in the darkness?

Yes, indeed...Penny's voice, weakly:	115

PENNY PRIDDY
Here...here at the back. I'm sorry...

	116
Buckaroo squints, spots her.  His voice comes mighty over the PUBLIC 
ADDRESS SYSTEM.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Raise your hand...where?

PENNY PRIDDY
(raising her hand)
This is so embarrassing...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that?  And a spotlight.  What's 
your name?

PENNY PRIDDY
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.

For reasons out of their control, Penny's name coming across to 
Buckaroo and the Cavaliers as "Peggy," said name immediately eliciting 
a surprised reaction from the Cavaliers...

...Buckaroo amazed as well...a not-too-distant pain deep in his soul 
momentarily manifesting itself, although he makes a brave attempt at 
nonchalance...as now Penny is given that microphone.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you say..."Peggy"?

PENNY PRIDDY
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean 
anything to you.  I'm a nobody.

The business of the names settled, Buckaroo and the Cavaliers breathing 
a bit more easily...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nobody's a nobody.  Why're you crying?  What's wrong?

PENNY PRIDDY
(blowing her nose)
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 
69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my 
luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record 
producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for 
life, and like a fool, well, I...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
He offered you money?

PENNY PRIDDY
Do I look like that kinda girl?
(to tell the truth)
I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep 
tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still 
got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, 
I'll always have a job.

A few snickers...BUCKAROO shooting a disapproving look at those guilty 
of laughing at another person's misfortune...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Remember it's always darkest just before the dawn.  Believe me, I've 
been there.

Buckaroo moving to a piano...starting to play...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on 
your luck.

PENNY PRIDDY
(exasperated)
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?

	117
Buckaroo and his men start to SING ANOTHER TUNE...slower, sexier.

	118
...and Penny opens HER BIG CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE, removes first a dog-
earned paperback entitled Beyond the Realm of Atomic Particles and 
Massless Photons, by Buckaroo Banzai...then a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC 
BOOK, its cover depicting Buckaroo locked in mortal combat with HANOI 
SHAN, THE MANCHU TERROR!  Penny lays both publications on the table, 
continues to dig around, revealing next a SHINY SMALL-CALIBER AUTOMATIC 
PISTOL...

	119
ON STAGE...as Buckaroo pours it on, looking in her direction...	

	120
Penny takes the gun from her purse and lays it in her lap, tears 
starting to flood her eyes...

	121
BUCKAROO CROONING, all the women enraptured by his voice, his sultry 
glance, his animal presence...a real heart-breaker.

	122
Penny takes another drink, wraps her hand around the tiny pearl 
handle...SLOWLY MOVING THE GUN...

	123
ON STAGE, Buckaroo startled...	

	124
...as in the blink of an eye Penny ATTEMPTS TO SHOOT HERSELF, her arm 
accidentally deflected by a passing WAITRESS, the SHOT going harmlessly 
into the ceiling as...

	125
...the crack Hong Kong Cavaliers whip out their GUNS, snapping back 
hammers, forming a human barricade around Buckaroo...

	126
...while BLUE SHIELD SECURITY MEN materialize and drag Penny screaming 
from the room.

PENNY PRIDDY
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Everybody okay up here?

ARTIE DUNCAN'S VOICE
Arrest the girl!  Let's get this thing on the road, huh?

	127
The Cavaliers holstering their weapons, resuming musical 
postures...Buckaroo too...but his mind still half on Penny Priddy.

INT.  CRIMINALLY INSANCE COORIDOR - NIGHT	128

Recreation time.  SEVERAL MADMEN playing video games, content.

Doctor Lizardo's Philco TV now sitting on a watch desk, the guard who 
took it eating dinner, leaning back in his chair, his feet on the 
set...so he can bash it now and then to improve the picture 
quality...as a SHADOW falls across him...Doctor Lizardo...pulling a 
RATTY SUITCASE on tiny travel wheels, wearing an ANCIENT SPORTJACKET.  
Out for a stroll?

GUARD
Where do you think you're going, doc? The moon?

	129
An amazing thing occurring, as Lizardo's right arm rockets out an 
catches the astonished guard around the throat, lifting him off the 
floor, Lizardo's left hand picking up the telephone...

DR. LIZARDO
Operator! I wanna place a person-to-person call to John Bigboote, 
Yoyodyne Propulsions Systems.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Tell him it's 
John Whorfin calling. That's W-H-O-R-F-I-N. Got it, honey? John! J-O-H-
N!

Lizardo waiting for the call to go through as he strangles the last 
breath of air out of the helpless guard, drops him to the linoleum, 
reaching for the dead man's keys...

DR. LIZARDO
(into phone)
Of course it's me, John Bigboote, you fool! Prepare for my return!  The 
time has come.  Haven't you heard? Don't you watch TV? Banzai and 
Hikita have done it! I'll meet you at the factory.  Get that 
overthruster!  And the little Jap!  Alive!  Banzai's too dangerous.

Lizardo ripping the phone out of the wall, hurling it across the 
room...

...those inmates playing their video games fleeing like rabbits when 
they see that...Lizardo obviously no ordinary lunatic, as he proves by 
simply reaching out and...

	130
...touching THE BUCKAROO BANZAI VIDEO GAME, instantly shorting it out 
on his way to freedom, suitcase in tow.

INT.  BEDROOM ON BUS - DAY	131

CLOSE ON a newspaper, a banner front page headline announcing the 
amazing Jet Car test...

...and down in a lower corner, A PHOTOGRAPH OF "WOULD-BE-ASSASSIN" 
PENNY PRIDDY being summarily escorted out of Artie's Artery...PULLING 
BACK TO REVEAL...

	132
...a simple steel frame bed, fold-out desk with microscope, scientific 
books everywhere...Buckaroo trying to tie his bowtie, glancing at the 
newspaper propped upon his dresser, that picture of Penny Priddy 
staring back at him...Perfect Tommy and Reno nearby assembling some 
kind of slide show...THE WHOLE ROOM SWAYING MYSTERIOUSLY...

...the two Cavaliers worrying more about Buckaroo than about what 
they're doing, as they fumble the slides, several falling to the 
floor...

PERFECT TOMMY
Pick those up, Reno.

RENO
I didn't drop 'em.

...Perfect Tommy getting up and peeking at the newspaper over 
Buckaroo's shoulder...then returning to Reno...their voices low...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's a spittin' image.

RENO 
Doesn't look anything like her to me.

PERFECT TOMMY
Pictures don't lie.

RENO 
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks 
so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, 
right?

	133
Buckaroo overhearing all of this, of course, as the door opens, Rawhide 
appearing, offering a COMPUTER PRINT-OUT...

RAWHIDE
Hot off the World Watch Wire, Buckaroo. Thought you'd wanna be 
notified. That old pal of the professor's, Dr. Emilio Lizardo?  The one 
you did the brain scan on--?  He killed a guard last night, broke outta 
the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, stole a Masarati, totaled 
it a block away.

Buckaroo's expression changing at the mention of the name 
Lizardo...taking the 
print-out.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Then what?

RAWHIDE
Vanished. Thin air.

PERFECT TOMMY
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?

RENO
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, so was Mr. Wizard.

RAWHIDE
Dr. Lizardo's a raving lunatic, Perfect Tommy, a vicious psychopath 
with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy 
brown like yours.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Have you warned Professor Hikita?

RAWHIDE
First thing I did.

PERFECT TOMMY
(in the dark)
Why?  What's going on?  Anything I oughta know?  C'mon, Rawhide, spill 
it.

Buckaroo nodding his permission...

RAWHIDE
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to 
discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before 
Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a 
rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half 
out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was 
orange...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.

RAWHIDE
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, 
got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away 
the key.

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.

Buckaroo heading for the door...Rawhide drawing a receipt book from his 
pocket.

RAWHIDE
And another thing.  Somebody took five bucks outta petty cash without 
signing.

Buckaroo and Reno automatically turning to Perfect Tommy...

PERFECT TOMMY
Wasn't me.  I'd take a hundred, right?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	134

...the guys following Buckaroo into an amazing ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, 
like the rugged interior of an AWACS, dimly lighted instrument panels 
manned by two BLUE SHIELD TECHNICAL EXPERTS.

RADAR SHEILD ONE
Lookit this, Buckaroo.  Grossly abnormal high-altitude electrostatic 
disturbance over Connecticut.  Fallout from the Jet Car, you think?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Doubt it.  Check NORAD command.  Could be a volcanic ash cloud.  Work 
her up statistically, check it for the next twenty-four hours, then 
shovel the data over to Reno.

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - DAY	135

Buckaroo coming through another heavy steel door, and for the first 
time we realize that we just might be on a MOVING BUS...

EXT.  POLICE STATION - ESTABLISHING - DAY	136

BUCKAROO'S BUS pulling up...BUCKAROO BANZAI AND THE HONG KONG CAVALIERS 
emblazoned along its side.

INT.  POLICE STATION - DAY	137

Waiting near the watch desk, Buckaroo's Jewish surgeon buddy, Dr. 
Zwibel...in a thousand-dollars worth of drugstore cowboy gear, a 
Hoppalong Cassidy hat, red alligator boots, listening to the local 
COUNTRY STATION on a suitcase size stereo...

...looking up as Buckaroo, Reno, and Perfect Tommy approach...

DR. ZWIBEL
Howdy, Buckaroo.  Got your message about rendezvousing here.  Barely 
had time to pack my saddlebags.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Sid, welcome aboard.
(shaking hands)
Fellas, meet a medical colleague, Sid Zwibel.  He'll be riding with us 
from now on, so get acquainted while I snoop around.

Buckaroo heading over to the DESK SERGEANT on duty...

RENO
The name's Reno.  This here's Perfect Tommy.

PERFECT TOMMY
Where do you hail from, Doc?

DR. ZWIBEL
(catching on)
New Jersey!

RENO NEVADA
Where's your spurs at?

DR. ZWIBEL
You making fun of me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Reno, how's about you take New Jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus 
and introduce him to the rest of the hands.

RENO
Why me?

PERFECT TOMMY
Cause Buckaroo needs me here.

Reno picking up Doctor Zwibel's huge stereo and suitcase...

RENO
Follow me, pard'ner.

INT.  CELL - DAY	138

Penny sitting on her bunk, a disheveled mess...depressed, her head 
buried in her hands as Buckaroo arrives.  She sees his reflection in 
the pitiful mirror above her toilet...

PENNY PRIDDY
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before 
any of this craziness.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go away.  Let me rot?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who were you really trying to kill last night?

PENNY PRIDDY
You.  Like the papers all say.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pretty terrible shot.

Silence.  Penny realizing you don't fool this man with the sloppy 
bowtie...coming over to the bars...

PENNY PRIDDY
Was she pretty?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who?

PENNY PRIDDY
The girl I remind you of.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.

PENNY PRIDDY
It's kinda hard this way.

Meaning fixing his tie...which she's trying to do...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.

PENNY PRIDDY
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?

PENNY PRIDDY
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, 
right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, I don't.

Penny taking too long to retie Buckaroo's tie...an excuse to be near 
him...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?

PENNY PRIDDY
Which?  The one in my throat.

Things really heating up between these two...Buckaroo changing the 
subject...blocking Perfect Tommy's view.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Did you have family there--? A sister?  In Cody?

PENNY PRIDDY
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Another 'you'?

PENNY PRIDDY
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I 
was adopted.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Adopted.  I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit 
me!

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with 
what you have...

Buckaroo touching her moist cheek, wiping away a tear.  Perfect Tommy 
and the Desk Sergeant exchanging looks...

PERFECT TOMMY
Running a little late, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let her out. In my custody.

PERFECT TOMMY
Let her out?  She's a killer.

Buckaroo and Penny unable to look away from each other.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No she's not. 

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE - AFTERNOON	139

REPORTERS, cameras, microphones, and a small audience of VIPS, civilian 
and military, in a large hotel conference room...eyes on the ticking 
clock...examining charts and MODELS OF SUBATOMIC PARTICLES...on the 
dais, Professor Hikita, Secretary of Defense McKinley and Senator 
Cunningham, waiting for Buckaroo.

	140
Over the refreshment table set up for reporters, TWO REDHEADED MEN 
WEARING GLASSES practically FILL THEIR CUPS WITH CUBES OF SUGAR...one 
of their arms ELONGATING (1) for more sugar...THE STRANGE MOVE 
UNNOTICED...

	141
...as the crowd breaks into SPONTANEOUS APPLAUSE and Buckaroo Banzai 
enter, Penny Priddy beside him...the glamorous couple surrounded by the 
Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	142
JOHN O'CONNOR, and JOHN GOMEZ, those two nearsighted REDHEADS with the 
sweet coffee applauding only politely.

	143
Buckaroo taking Penny onto the dais with him, the Cavaliers assuming 
positions of security as...

...Buckaroo sits next to Professor Hikita who shields his remarks from 
what must be easily FIFTY MICROPHONES...

PROF. HIKITA
Rawhide tells me Dr. Lizardo escaped...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(nodding)
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, 
just in case.

Professor Hikita removing the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER from his 
battered briefcase and laying it on the table.  Buckaroo taking a sip 
of water...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Thank you for coming.  Before I answer any questions, I think Buckaroo 
owes us all a few explanations for yesterday's antics.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. Secretary...Senator Cunningham, ladies and gentlemen...thirty years 
ago, nearly to this day, my mother and father and Sir Alan Motley, all 
former colleagues of Professor Toichi Hikita at the Texas School of 
Mines, gave their lives for what was considered at the time an insane 
notion: the possibility of contacting alien life... not on another 
planet, but on a simultaneous plane of existence within solid 
matter...life which, before the war, Professor Hikita had actually 
glimpsed while pioneering a highly primitive gravity catapult with 
Doctor Emilio Lizardo.

1st REPORTER
The same Doctor Lizardo that just...?

PROF. HIKITA
One and the same.

	144
SOMEONE ELSE'S NEARSIGHTED POV, PEERING AT THE BACK OF PROFESSOR 
HIKITA'S HEAD THROUGH A CRACK IN THE CURTAINS BEHIND THE DAIS...

	145
John O'Connor and John Gomez at the refreshment table now adding 
several packs of 'Sweet 'n' Low' to their thick coffee as...

ON THE DAIS:	146

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I don't wanna go get too technical here, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm 
talking twister physics.  Quantum Mechanics.  Now you see, now you 
don't.  This table I'm sitting behind?  It appears to be solid matter, 
right?

Buckaroo demonstrating by picking up his plastic water glass, dropping 
it, splashing water left and right as the container naturally bounces 
off the table...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
But in point of fact, the solid parts of this table... the protons, 
quarks, your neutrons and electrons...they comprise only about one 
quadrillionth of its total volume.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Which is not a helluva lot to sink your teeth into.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Exactly.  So the professor here, way back in 1937, figured that if 
solid matter is mostly empty space, a person oughta be able to discover 
a to travel inside things like tables.  And mountains.

PROF. HIKITA
We at the Banzai Institute have at last found that way: an alternating 
gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its 
electroweak forces!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, 
professor?

2nd REPORTER
What about the Pentagon?  The possibility of war in the Eighth 
Dimension, Mr. Secretary?

PENNY PRIDDY
Hey, better there than here, huh?

SOME APPLAUSE, the Secretary of Defense eyeing Penny critically as the 
lights dim...as RADAR SHIELD ONE slips into the room, approaches the 
dais, and the FIRST SLIDE is projected onto the screen...

	147
...the image a murky one...but the outline of a WARSHIP WITH U.S. 
SAILORS ABOARD nonetheless unmistakable...

CLOSE ON:	148

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(a whisper)
The President's calling you, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The president of what?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
The President of the United States.

	149
ANOTHER SLIDE, even more graphic, the number on the bow of the ship 
plainly visible...7541.

EVERYONE CAPTIVATED.	150

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is he still delirious?

RADAR SHIELD ONE
(shrugging)
Can't tell. It's real fuzzy. I patched him through to a pay phone down 
the hall.

PROF. HIKITA
In 1942, a U.S. Navy frigate, number 7541, disappeared on a clear day 
in the North Atlantic. Long thought to have been torpedoed, these 
pictures of 7541 were taken yesterday in the Eighth Dimension.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now wait a minute here...

PROF. HIKITA
Next transparency, please.

A loud murmur from the audience as the next slide in the projector 
proves to be a remarkable image...

...of AN UPSIDE DOWN SEVENTEENTH CENTURY PIRATE VESSEL.	151

...Buckaroo starting from the table only to be reminded by Penny:	152

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo, don't forget your thruster.

...handing him the OSCILLATION OVERTHRUSTER...Buckaroo declining it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You keep an eye on it.

PENNY PRIDDY
Any time. 

EXT.  OUTER SPACE - AFTERNOON	153

Meanwhile, several thousand miles overhead, a HUGE SPIKEY SPACECRAFT 
APPROACHES EARTH...

INT.  SPIKEY SPACECRAFT (FATHER SHIP) - AFTERNOON	154

A mysterious cloud room where BLACK BRRODING CREATURES perch upside 
down and sideways at controls in a smoky, vaporous environment, the 
only illumination EERIE YELLOW LIGHT...THE WALLS BREATHING.

BUCKAROO BANZAI'S VOICE
Mr. President--? You there?

MORE NOISES, THE SOUND OF TELEPHONE SWITCHING EQUIPMENT...

INT.  CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON	155

Back at a pay phone in the corridor, Buckaroo trying to figure out why 
the President doesn't answer. 

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Seemed like a bad connection even back on the bus.  But they used the 
code.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Mr. President--?  Some kind of interference...I can't...

Nothing from the other end except ODD SOUNDING COMPUTER BEEPS and the 
STATIC-LADEN VOICES of several operators...

RAWHIDE
Maybe it's just a prankster. Some computer whiz kid.

RENO
Whoever it was they used the Blue Code, Alpha Clearance.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to Radar Shield One)
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.

RAWHIDE
And try the President's private number at the hospital.  Make sure this 
is on the level. We're busy people here.

	156
...when suddenly eerie, inexplicable things begin to occur...ALL HAVING 
TO DO WITH ELECTRICITY...the telephone book scooting closer to 
Buckaroo's fingers as if drawn by a magnet, the pages then turning, 
faster and faster...

	157
...Buckaroo amazed...now the glass phone booth door abruptly slamming 
shut, the phone simultaneously emitting a BIZARRE BUZZ...

	158
...and then Buckaroo gets literally the shock of his life...A MIGHTY 
ELECTRICAL CURRENT PASSING THROUGH THE TELEPHONE...

...AND HURLING HIM OUT INTO THE COORIDOR!	159

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Pencil!  Quick!  Pen!  Anything!

Reno complying, the lights returning to normal, Buckaroo dazed, his 
hand moving automatically, writing on any surface available.

A SPARK flying when he touches the metal-tipped pen to metal!	160

Buckaroo finally settling for his hand, SCRIBBLING NUMBERS ON HIS PALM.
	161

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON	162

PROF. HIKITA
Let me ask you to imagine the Oscillation Overthruster as a 
sophisticated rifle accelerator firing a steady stream of protons at a 
target-in this case a mountain-and the Jet Car as a giant super-
conducting magnet.

The Secretary of Defense fascinated.	163

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Sure, sure, but what about the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Seventh 
Dimensions?

PENNY PRIDDY
(thumbing through her paperback)
I don't guess they matter.  It's like cheesecloth, I think.  Minkowiski 
space...

...as all eyes turn to see a still woozy Buckaroo Banzai returning, 
pointing dramatically at John Gomez and John O'Connor in the 
audience...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There!  Those two!  Don't panic...

The Cavaliers haven't a clue what he's talking about...

RENO
Whadda you mean, Buckaroo?  Where?  What?

	164
BUCKAROO'S POV...SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY...ACROSS THE ROOM, TWO GHASTLY 
ALIENS, GIANT RED ARACHTOIDS WEARING SUITS AND TIES, HOLDING COFFEE 
CUPS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Evil...pure and simple, from the eighth dimension! Grab 'em!

	165
RENO'S POV...NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY...neither Reno nor anyone else 
in the room seeing what Buckaroo does, seeing instead only those two 
redheaded gents who like their coffee sweet, John O'Connor and John 
Gomez...COULD THEY POSSIBLY BE THE CRIMSON CREATURES BUCKAROO THINKS 
ARE:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids! Stop 'em!

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Arachtoids?

	166
Buckaroo breaking into a dead run across the room, those two astonished 
RED ALIENS racing for the nearest exit!

	167
The Hong Kong Cavaliers rushing to help Buckaroo when suddenly the 
PIERCING SCREAM of Penny Priddy causes them to stop in their tracks and 
look toward the dais...

...where yet NOTHER REDHEAD called JOHN BIGBOOTÉ, in glasses and dark 
suit, a bandanna over his face, has just stepped from behind the 
curtain and seized Professor Hikita, pointing a revolver at the old 
man's head...the Cavaliers instinctively stepping toward the dais, 
outraged...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Okay, wise guys! 

...the masked John Bigbooté FIRING once, wounding Reno in the 
shoulder...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Let those gun belts hit the floor! And nobody follows, or the prof is 
history! 

The pistol stuck in Professor Hikita's ear convincing the Cavaliers to 
obey, to watch helplessly as the kidnapper backs his victim through the 
curtain and out of sight...as new Jersey administers first aid to Reno 
and Penny strokes the fallen Cavalier's hair, berating the idle 
bystanders around them:

PENNY PRIDDY
Is this the kind of society you want?  A society of weak-kneed 
jellyfish wallowing in self-pity, prey to ruthless hoodlums who pick us 
off like flies?

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Or a society where we stand strong, take charge of our own destiny, 
with the cry "So far and no farther will we be pushed!"

INT.  HOTEL BOWELS - MOVING - AFTERNOON	168

Buckaroo in the meantime running down a flight of stairs...catching 
sight of his prey...THOSE TWO MONSTROUS RED ALIENS running through a 
swinging door...

...Buckaroo accelerating, hitting the door with every ounce of strength 
in him...

INT.  UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATE AFTERNOON	169

...Buckaroo flying through the door, taking a fall down concrete steps, 
finding himself in the hotel parking garage where a MOTORCYCLE SHOW is 
unloading equipment...

...Buckaroo spotting THREE SHADOWY FORMS halfway across the lot loading 
A LARGE CRATE into a van...

Buckaroo wasting no time going after the van, as it starts 
up...commandeering A FANCY NEW MOTORCYCLE, charging after the van 
despite an EXHIBITOR'S warning:

EXHIBITOR
Hey, you can't ride that! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON	170

The Cavaliers coming from two directions, colliding at an 
intersection...

PERFECT TOMMY
Any sign of Buckaroo?

RENO
No!  Ditto the professor-

RAWHIDE
Shit!

EXT.  CITY STREETS - LATE AFTERNOON	171

The van speeds by...the motorcycle pursues!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON	172

The chase continues, leaving the city behind...

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - LATER AFTERNOON	173

...the van coming straight toward us, thundering past...as Buckaroo and 
his motorcycle next roar INTO CAMERA in hot pursuit, and over his 
shoulder an AWESOME SIGHT...

...A DARK, UNNERVINGLY PREHISTORIC CREATURE FLYING DIRECTLY AT US, 
GROWING LARGER AND LARGER ON THE SCREEN, BUCKAROO UNAWARE OF ITS 
EXISTENCE...

EXT.  FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON	174

Twilight enveloping a New Jersey meadow as a pair of DUCK HUNTERS and 
their DOG takes advantage of the last half hour of fading daylight 
as...

...that BLACK CREATURE wings overhead!	175

	176
The duck hunters confused, frightened, FIRING, as a reflex reaction to 
this sudden threat from above!

	177
CLOSE ON the AWFUL BLACK CREATURE HIT, swooping low with a horrible 
shudder!

The hunters transfixed...	178

DUCK HUNTERS
My God!  What the hell...

The FRIGHTFUL sound of the CREATURE'S FAILING LUNGS...a terrific noise 
as the duck hunters hurry to where their unnatural kill hangs obscured 
in a gigantic tree...their dog running ahead, intent on retrieving this 
unusual "BIRD"...

EXT.  TREE - LATE AFTERNOON	179

The heavy-footed hunters SLOSHING THROUGH WATER, the first hunter to 
arrive on the scene using a sharp stick to poke at a BULGING BLADDER on 
the bottom of the strange creature, the sac bursting and drenching the 
hunter with a hideous viscous fluid...SPARKS!  AND A STRANGE BLUE 
DUST...

	180
...as suddenly AN ENORMOUS SPHERE drops out of the tree and begins 
rolling toward the hunter who poked that sac...

DUCK HUNTERS
Jesus Christ--!  What is it?

The other hunter following the ODD SPERE as it backs his buddy into a 
shallow swamp...the thing coming to a stop and...

	181
...A BLACK MAN with dreadlocks emerging from the top of the weird 
vessel, trying to balance himself when he slips and crashes to the 
ground, his neck breaking...a beam from his dropped 'flashlight' 
revealing him in death to be not a black man, but a BLACK ALIEN WITH A 
THREE-FINGERED HAND...

	182
...the hunters terrified as their dog starts snarling at the tree where 
now a second BLACK MAN has emerged, running for the road, jumping the 
fence like a gazelle...

	183
...the hunters not seeing this second individual, obsessed instead with 
a BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK they've discovered in the dead alien's 
fingers.

1ST HUNTER
It's the latest issue!

EXT.  COUNTRYSIDE - TWILIGHT	184

Buckaroo still on his MOTORCYCLE in pursuit of the van, taking a daring 
shortcut down a treacherous hillside...

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	185

Alien John Bigbooté at the wheel, alien John Gomez riding shotgun, in 
high spirits, cradling a DRY CELL BATTERY, his strange tongue upon it, 
getting high...his teeth glowing.

Bigbooté turning in his seat, overhearing alien John O'Connor operating 
a RADIO in the rear of the speeding van...

JOHN O'CONNOR
What? A black ship?  Where?
(listening)
A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?

John Bigbooté looking at John Gomez for any possible explanation.

JOHN GOMEZ
John Whorfin...maybe they know he's escaped!

JOHN O'CONNER
How?  How could they possibly know?  They're more than three trillion 
six hundred sixty million miles away.

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
(jerking the wheel)
They know everything!  I told Whorfin to sit tight.  This could be the 
end of us all!  We gotta get Banzai's Overthruster and get off this 
rock!

EXT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	186

The van making a 180( turn!

INT.  VAN - TWILIGHT	187

John Bigbooté yelling back to John O'Connor:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Where was it, John O'Connor? How far back?

JOHN O'CONNOR
I have a radio fix...

John Gomez opening the glove compartment, taking out a pistol:

JOHN GOMEZ
Death to the enemy!

JOHN O'CONNOR
Death to the enemy--!  Kill or die!

John Bigbooté just driving...his strange eyes set.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	188

Buckaroo rounding a curve on his motorcycle when that van is suddenly 
upon him, coming head on!

Buckaroo just having a split-second to catch the logo 'Yoyodyne' on the 
front of the van as he swerves into a ditch to avoid certain death...

	189
...Buckaroo quickly restarting the motorcycle and taking out A SWISS 
ARMY LIGHTER/MINIATURE TWO-WAY RADIO, making a call to:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide.  Come in.  Over.

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	190

Back in the press conference room, the anxious Cavaliers try to help 
several LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPES reconstruct the professor's kidnapping.  
A TINY BUZZER going off in Rawhide's pocket:  his SWISS ARMY CIGARETTE 
LIGHTER.  Rawhide turns his Back on everyone, taking out a pack of 
Luckies, lighting up as he talks quietly into the FLAME:

RAWHIDE
Over, Buckaroo.  What's up?  Where in Hades are you?  I'm getting a 
lotta static.

EXT.  ROAD - TWILIGHT	191

Buckaroo pushing and shoving his motorcycle onto a woodland path...IT 
IS GETTING QUITE DARK...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the 
homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.

RAWHIDE
Buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the Professor!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The deuce you say.
(realizing)
That crate!

INT.  PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM - TWILIGHT	192

Elsewhere in the room, nervous and concerned, Penny Priddy sits apart 
from the others, thumping the keys of a piano...

RAWHIDE
What crate?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and 
dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.

RAWHIDE
(into flame)
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?  You think they're mixed up in this?

...Reno sitting down next to Penny at the piano, his wounded arm in a 
sling but his fingers nimble as ever...

PENNY PRIDDY
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?

RENO
Nigh on ten years.  Been through a lotta scrapes together.

PENNY PRIDDY
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?

RENO
Government work.  Had my own think tank.  Got tired of thinking-wanted 
some action.  Seen plenty of it too.  So will you if you stick around.

PENNY PRIDDY
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?

RENO
Course he's alive.  He's Buckaroo Banzai.

Rawhide calling from across the room...

RAWHIDE
All right.  Let's go!  We got our work cut out for us tonight!

Reno getting up, Penny unsure at that moment whether she's being 
included, as those steely eyes of Rawhide zero in on her...

RAWHIDE
You, too, Miss Penny.

EXT.  ROAD - NIGHT	193

Darkness as Buckaroo races on, the taillights of the van far ahead...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	194

John Gomez now sharing his DRY CELL BATTERY with John O'Connor, the two 
of them singing a SONG from their home planet...

...John Bigbooté at the wheel, preoccupied, refusing their offer of a 
toke on the battery with:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No thanks, I'm driving.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	195

The Yoyodyne van approaching the scene of the downed spacecraft, the 
headlights of the single HIGHWAY PATROL CAR illuminating the CORPSE OF 
THE DEAD CREATURE in the water...the HIGHWAY PATROLMAN pulling the 
figure out of the water, the hunters standing by...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Hand me that tarp. Let's cover this guy...

2ND HUNTER
What guy? He's got paws.

The other hunter tossing a plastic tarp over the body as they all turn 
to regard the headlights of the Yoyodyne van...the cop heading that 
way...

	196
BUCKAROO ARRIVING now too, scraping to a stop on his motorcycle in 
heavy brush, creeping closer to the crash site for a better look...

	197
BUCKAROO'S POV: The ungainly SPHERICAL SPACECRAFT and that amazing DEAD 
CREATURE on the ground, covered now with a sheet of semi-transparent 
plastic...observing John Bigbooté and John Gomez producing official 
I.D.s and appearing to BUCKAROO AS CRIMSON ALIENS...TO THE COPS AS...

ORDINARY CITIZENS:	198

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Bigbooté, Officer. Executive Vice President, Yoyodyne Propulsion 
Systems.

JOHN GOMEZ
(of the spacecraft)
One of our birds.

The highway patrolman returning Bigbooté's I.D., still a little 
skeptical about the whole thing, pointing to THE DEAD CREATURE UNDER 
PLASTIC.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That fella over there-that one of yours, too, is it?

John Bigbooté having a ready answer...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
The droid, you mean?

Buckaroo moving quickly to the back of the van, starting to open the 
rear door with a locksmith's pick attached to his special SWISS ARMY 
LIGHTER.

JOHN O'CONNOR
Button up in there, Professor, if you know what's good for you.

John O'Connor stepping out for a smoke.

EXT.  VAN - NIGHT	203

Buckaroo watching the alien John O'Connor move off in the direction of 
the hunters, retrieving his dropped Swiss Army lighter, not noticing 
that the once blinking L.E.D. on the homing device has gone out!  
Buckaroo again picking the lock...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	204

...ordinary citizen John O'Connor meanwhile observing the hunters still 
hanging around, one of them engrossed in the Buckaroo comic, his pal 
trying to figure out how to operate the dead alien's unusual 
flashlight...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nice night, huh?

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	205

EXT.  SWAMP - NIGHT	207

John Bigbooté, John Gomez, and the cop looming above the dead 
creature...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Looks like nothing I ever seen. I seen droids in space movies, but 
they're nothing like this-

JOHN GOMEZ
It's a three-man thermopod...

John Bigbooté shooting John Gomez a hard stare...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Thermopod?  What's a...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Very T.S.  Top Secret, right John Gomez?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Yeah, well, I was gonna call Buckaroo Banzai out here to have a look.  
Right up his alley, I think.

John Bigbooté's mood suddenly changing...tensing...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
You called Buckaroo Banzai?

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Not yet.  I said I was gonna.

The three of them looking up at another pair of headlights arriving, A 
SEDAN, the cop yelling at them:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Go on!  Keep it moving!

JOHN GOMEZ
We got a truck on the way to mop things up for you.  Else this place 
could become a zoo, not to mention a haven for gawkers.

The highway patrolman moving off to deal with the sedan...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
We'll just go ahead and start breaking it down.

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Don't touch it!  I got my own help on the way!  That's an order!

John Bigbooté frowning, telling John Gomez:

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
There's a crowbar in the truck.

John Gomez nodding, heading back to the van...

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	208

...as Buckaroo pries his way into the crate, extracting the shaken 
Professor Hikita.

A SPARK dancing between them as they touch!	209

	210
PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo!  What the Sam Hill!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  I'm hotter than 
flapjacks.

PROF. HIKITA
What?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us.  
Form the Eighth Dimension, I think.  Look...

Buckaroo trying to show Professor Hikita the MATHEMATICAL FORMULA 
written on his hand.

PROF. HIKITA
You can see them? 

Buckaroo holding a finger to his lips...whispering...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. 
What is it?

PROF. HIKITA
It's your hand, Buckaroo.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me 
scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.

Buckaroo opening the door to the van.

BUCKAROO SEES the red alien John Gomez coming closer...	211

	212
PROF. HIKITA
Antidote to what?  Whose disguises?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoids.  From Planet Ten.

PROF. HIKITA
Planet 10?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(pointing quickly)
There's a Harley behind those bushes.  Get back to the laboratory and 
start working on the formula.  We don't have time to ask questions.  
Just synthesize it-

The professor still without the crucial information, however...John 
Gomez approaching...

PROF. HIKITA
Buckaroo, the formula--

Thinking fast, Buckaroo presses the palm of his hand to Professor 
Hikita's forehead, the ball-point ink transferring...THE IMPORTANT 
FORMULA IMPRINTED IN REVERSE ON THE PROFESSOR'S SHINY PATE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Hurry!  Please.

Meanwhile back on Buckaroo's bus, in the nerve center, Rawhide and 
Perfect Tommy look at a BLANK OSCILLOSCOPE operated by a Blue Shield

RAWHIDE
Too long.  We better get somebody over there.  Put up the grid, last 
known location--

Scooter racing outside toward his father, CASPER LINDLEY, the station 
owner, an everyday no-nonsense guy in grungy overalls, presently trying

A weary, worried Rawhide comes back into the front of the bus and takes

Trouble?

RAWHIDE
Nah-Damn sophisticated equipment always breaking down.

Reno wondering if there's more to it than Rawhide's saying...Rawhide 
losing himself in a copy of American Horseman.

Penny leaning forward, thinking, picking at a guitar left on the seat 
in front of her, watching the mysterious Hong Kong Cavaliers.

	222
Perfect Tommy arriving, whispering something in Rawhide's ear, Rawhide 
nodding...

Penny looking over at Perfect Tommy across the aisle, Perfect Tommy 
confiscating the guitar...his guitar.

PENNY PRIDDY
What's his problem?

RENO
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that 
thing?

PENNY PRIDDY
Better than him.

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	223

Buckaroo jockeying for an improved position, as the alien John Gomez 
prepares to strike the pod-TWO MEN getting out of the sedan 
now...ARACHTOIDS in baggy suits...

...THE CROWBAR HITTING THE POD for the first time!

	224
The cop turning, shouting at John Gomez from his squad car:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
Whadda you think you're doing?  Hey!

The cop in a jam, heading back toward the pod, as the two newly arrived 
redheads follow him despite his instructions:

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
I said back off!  I mean it.  Now get in your car and get the hell 
outta here!

...the two goons halting...but as soon as the cop turns, they follow 
him again...

RENO
She's not Peggy, Mrs. Johnson--

MRS. JOHNSON
Not Peggy--!  Of course not. How could she be, huh?  Whew.

of BLUE SHIELD TECHNICIANS...one a brainy, wiry kid in his late teens.

BRAINY KID
Hi, fellas...gonna lay down some background vocals tonight?

RAWHIDE
Wish life was so simple, Billy.  Remember that outfit the Justice 
Department checked into last year-Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems?

BRAINY KID (BILLY)
The big space and weapons high tech consortium way behind on their 
delivery of the controversial new Truncheon Bomber?

PERFECT TOMMY
You got her.  Buckaroo's orders: access their data bank.  Attack their 
systems.  Up to it?

BILLY
I'm a little short-handed tonight.  My phone phreaks went into town for 
the big ice cream social...

NEW JERSEY
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!

BILLY
Who're you?

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	230

Buckaroo watches the alien John Gomez deliver ANOTHER BLOW to the black 
space pod, as inside...

INT.  BLACK THERMOPOD - NIGHT	231

...sits a single BLACK ARACHTOID CREWMAN named JOHN GANT, stoically at 
this communications console, trying to focus on a DISTORTED PICTURE 
FROM DEEP SPACE even as his enemy pounds and cuts through the hull...

CLOSE ON CONSOLE	232

...the picture of his video console coming into focus: a HIGHER-RANKING 
BLACK ARACHTOID WING COMMANDER ON TV:

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
Destroy yourself, John Gant.  Set detonator.

INT.  FATHER SHIP - NIGHT	233

...the BLACK ARACHTOID WING COMMANDER standing at his radio-video 
console, receiving a picture of "John Gant"...

ON TV	234

JOHN GANT
Detonator set.  My most profuse apologies to my homeland and loved 
ones.  John Valuk is dead.  He fell on his head, but perhaps John 
Parker will get through!

The screen going dark.

	235
THE ARACHTOID WING COMMANDER exchanging words with his second-in-
command...

SECOND-IN-COMMAND
But what if John Parker too is dead?  Then we must send another 
thermopod at once to contact Buckaroo Banzai!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
There's no time.  We have our order from John Emdall.

INT.  VAN - NIGHT	236

The alien John O'Connor looking in on the crate...finding it 
empty...lid off...

EXT.  CRASH SITE - NIGHT	237

Ordinary citizen John Gomez HITTING the little thermopod again, the cop 
exasperated, pushed to the brink, surrounded...

HIGHWAY PATROLMAN
That's it, gentlemen, you're all under...

The cop reaches for his pistol when suddenly John Bigbooté whirls and 
lunges out with HIS TELESCOPING ARM, chopping the cop's Adam's apple, 
knocking him to the ground...

...the hunters stunned, one of them reaching for a shotgun when the two 
newly-arrived Yoyodyne goons attack, easily knocking the hunters to the 
ground, beating them!

	238
Bucakroo starting forward, but A THREE-DIGIT HAND suddenly on his 
shoulder!  Spinning him around!

VOICE
Easy, friend-

Buckaroo face-to-face with RED ARACHTOID John O'Connor, the latter 
surprised to discover it's...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Buckaroo Banzai--!

Buckaroo taking advantage of this creature's momentary amazement to 
kick O'Connor below the belt...dropping him to the turf...now spying 
yet another set of headlights coming down the road...

JOHN O'CONNOR
(in pain)
It's Buckaroo Banzai! Get him! He let the professor outta the box!

	239
The goons pursuing Buckaroo onto the road, the HEADLIGHTS OF A TRUCK 
bearing down on them...Buckaroo waving back at the truck, his only 
chance, when suddenly, instead of slowing, the truck speeds up, trying 
to run him over...YOYODYNE!

...Buckaroo lunging to safety at the last minute, getting up and 
running into a field...the Yoyodyne truck making a 180( turn and coming 
after him, across the meadow.

	240
...Buckaroo pursued by the truck and the goons when suddenly THE BLACK 
THERMOPOD EXPLODES, Buckaroo and the goons flying to the ground, 
Buckaroo quickly up and running, the truck gaining on 
him...gaining...still gaining when out of nowhere, A ROPE LADDER falls 
from the sky, entangling Buckaroo and pulling him up to a hovering 
HELICOPER...

INT.  HELICOPTER - NIGHT	241

Piloting the small chopper, Casper Lindley, gas station proprietor, 
along with his eager son, Scooter...both father and son dressed in Blue 
Shield outfits now...Casper giving Buckaroo a helping hand into the 
swift-flying craft and getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK, COMING THIS 
CLOSE TO DROPPING BUCKAROO!

CASPER LINDLEY
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the 
Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty 
tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll 
be worried.

Buckaroo reaching for the mike, relieved to feel only a SLIGHT 
ELECTRICAL CHARGE on touching it...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not the famous Scooter....?

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow.  You know it.

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	242

Professor Hikita on motorcycle, being waved through the front gate by a 
BLUE SHIELD GUARD while a second Shield, PINKY CARRUTHERS (on 
HORSEBACK), telephones ahead...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
The prof just rolled in.  Says he's on his way to the lab and "Do not 
disturb."

INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	243

Reno on the phone, getting the word on Hikita while the other Cavaliers 
watch Billy call up a strange senseless MAZE OF LETTERS AND NUMBERS on 
his monitor...

RAWHIDE
Try a new cipher.  Try G.

BILLY 
G cipher. There!  More like it!

NEW JERSEY
Nice work, kid.

	244
CLOSE UP SCREEN:  the letters having at least turned into something 
coherent...a batch of names and dates, vital statistics...headed 
"YOYODYNE."

	245
BILLY
Looks like we've accessed their Read Only Memory...a personnel file. 
Could be highly revealing.

RENO
(rejoining the group)
The professor just pulled in, jabbering something about space monsters, 
locked himself in his lab.

PERFECT TOMMY
"Space monsters"...my ass.

INT.  HALLWAY/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	246

Mrs. Johnson leading Penny down a richly paneled corridor past pictures 
and momentoes of Buckaroo and the Cavaliers, past and present...

MRS. JOHNSON
I'm sure the boys like you.  They just don't wanna get attached...and 
then see what happened to Buckaroo's last sweetheart happen to you.

PENNY PRIDDY
What happened to her?

Mrs. Johnson biting her tongue...

MRS. JOHNSON
You know any judo?

PENNY PRIDDY
Any what?

MRS. JOHNSON
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

Penny staring at this strange young girl, not knowing what to say...

PENNY PRIDDY
What's up those stairs?

MRS. JOHNSON
Bunkhouse.  Off limits.  You'll be bedding down in here.

...Mrs. Johnson opening a guest room door...Penny eyeing those 
forbidden stairs...

INT.  STUDIO COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT	247

BILLY
This is queer...look...

Billy staring intently at the monitor...the others leaning in...

	248
CLOSE ON MONITOR:  a list of IDENTICAL DATES AND PLACES NEXT TO A RAFT 
OF NAMES.

	249
BILLY
All these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in New 
Jersey on the exact same date.

NEW JERSEY
New Jersey?

BILLY
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.

RAWHIDE
Grover's Mills, Grovers' Mills...1938.  Why's that so darn familiar?

RENO
Looks like none of these guys ever lived anywhere else.  No places of 
birth.  And all of them with the same first name: John.

New Jersey studying the screen...

NEW JERSEY
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and 
November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. 
October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it? 
(obviously not)
Orson Welles!

BILLY 
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?

NEW JERSEY
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast 
that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were 
landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out 
to be a hoax.

BILLY
Then that's it!

RENO
What's it?

NEW JERSEY
Right!  Hoax my eye!

RENO
You mean--?  No!

BILLY
Yes!  Martians!  Right across the river in Grover's Mills!

EXT.  FRONT GATES/BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	250

Pinky Carruthers aboard his palomino as JOHN PARKER (the only alien to 
escape the black thermopod) rides up outside the gate on a 
bicycle...holding a STRANGE YELLOW RECORD in his grasp...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
Hi, buddy, what can I do for ya?

JOHN PARKER
Buckaroo Banzai?

PINKY CARRUTHERS
You a messenger? What've you got here?

Pinky Carruthers snatching the ODD YELLOW RECORD through the gate...

JOHN PARKER
I need see Buckaroo Banzai in person. My name is John Parker. Identify 
yourself.

PINKY CARRUTHERS
Knight Commander, Pinky Carruthers. Sorry, John, all these people "need 
see" Buckaroo in person.

And with that Pinky Carruthers is gone, trotting up toward the mansion 
on his palomino...

...as a frustrated John Parker suddenly sticks his nose in the air, 
getting a whiff of something, causing him to get on his bike and 
pedal...

EXT.  OUTSIDE SECURITY WALL - NIGHT	251

...around the corner of Buckaroo's estate where he notices a PARKED VAN 
and THREE SHADOWY FIGURES lowering themselves into the ground near the 
high security wall...disappearing...

...John Parker approaching, beholding...that familiar "Yoyodyne" 
van...and a FRESHLY DUG HOLE, crawling into the hold himself.

EXT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE GROUNDS - NIGHT	252

...surfacing WITHIN THE WALLS OF THE ESTATE and again catching sight of 
THE SHADOWY FIGURES moving toward the buildings, John Parker 
following...quickly ducking behind a tree, trying to get himself a good 
view of the three intruders...

SUDDEN VOICE
That's as far as you go, pal.

John Parker jerking his head around, finding himself confronting the 
FRIGHTENING SILHOUETTE of a Blue Shield in camouflage commando gear...

	253
...John Parker instinctively raising a hand to protect himself when 
without warning, a second BLUE SHIELD drops on his head from the tree 
above, knocking him down...

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	254

Closed...SAM, the mechanic, next to Buckaroo's precious JET CAR, 
tinkering with that damaged Harley Davidson...the garage door suddenly 
sliding open, startling Sam...no one there.

SAM
Okay, who's the funny guy?

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	255

In the buses, CLOSE ON SOMETHING WEIRD EMERGING SLOWLY FROM TEH ALIEN 
JOHN BIGBOOTÉ'S MOUTH...SHARP...

Sam stepping forward...A FIVE-PRONGED ORGANIC STINGER THE SIZE OF A 
WALNUT FLYING OUT OF THE NIGHT!  A scream dying in Sam's throat as he 
clutches his heart, John Bigbooté dragging him back into the garage.

INT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	256

...while the red alien John Gomez remains outside as a lookout, the 
alien John O'Connor quickly peering into the locked Jet Car and 
smashing the window, searching in vain for the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Not here!  No Overthruster!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
John Whorfin will kill us!

JOHN O'CONNOR
You look!  It's not here!

JOHN GOMEZ
Professor Hikita!

EXT.  GARAGE - NIGHT	257

Outside, John Gomez making a startling discovery: the figure of 
Professor Hikita near an upstairs window of the research building only 
yards away...when suddenly overhead...

	258
GOMEZ'S POV...CASPER LINDLEY'S CHOPPER...landing behind a stand of 
trees as the alien intruders scatter for cover.

INT.  DEN - NIGHT	259

Mrs. Johnson sitting near a crackling fire, at a small desk stacked 
high with books and papers, her nose in an advanced chemical 
engineering text.

...looking up as the front door opens, admitting Buckaroo Banzai, 
Casper and Scooter bringing up the rear...

MRS. JOHNSON
Buckaroo!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Is the professor here? Where's Penny?

MRS. JOHNSON
Both of 'em safe and sound. What's going on?  Everybody's freakin' out.

A shaken Rawhide, Reno, Perfect Tommy appearing on the stairway...

RENO 
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What? How do you know that?

RAWHIDE
It's all on the record. Come on-

Buckaroo heading up the stairs...

	260
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY...BUCKAROO MOVING QUICKLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR with his 
men, being debriefed on the run:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect 
Tommy?  The invisible body?

PERFECT TOMMY
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 
at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...

RENO
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and 
they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?

PERFECT TOMMY
Lizardo caused it all.  Because he was already here on earth, screwing 
around with his own stupid Overthruster.

RAWHIDE
Faulty design.  It sucked.

RENO
...but he wasn't the real Doctor Lizardo...just this arachtoid creep 
that stole the good doc's body the year before in the Eighth Dimension 
when Prof. Hikita's lab exploded...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stole his body?  When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind 
snapped?  Of course!  What else?

PERFECT TOMMY
It wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  It wasn't to 
talk to the head honcho.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It?  Who does?

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	261

Professor Hikita and his assistant toil away, starting at...

	262
...an elaborate electron-tube apparatus that just now beings to produce 
TINY GLOWING GREEN PARTICLES...

	263
...the professor excited, confused...rechecking Buckaroo's EQUATION ON 
HIS FOREHEAD by looking into a mirror.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	264

...while Billy places John Parker's UNUSUAL YELLOW RECORD on a 
turntable in Buckaroo's cluttered office...Casper and Scooter and the 
Cavaliers seeking protection behind a PLEXIGLAS 'BLACKBOARD', their 
faces seen through a maze of mathematical symbols and equations...

	265
...Buckaroo at his messy desk with a can of beer, FASCINATED TO SEE HE 
STILL POSSESSES ENOUGH STATIC ELECTRICITY IN HIS HAND TO DRAW A SHEET 
OF PAPER UP FROM THE BLOTTER LIKE A MAGNET!

RENO 
Stand back, man...

	266
...as the needle now comes down on the yellow disc, and amid a flurry 
of SMOKE AND SPARKS, A GORGEOUS BLACK HUMAN FEMAL sizzles up from the 
grooves of the record and hovers in mid-air...A HOLOGRAM!

HOLOGRAM
Salutations, great Buckaroo Banzai.  I am John Emdall from Planet 10.  
A common grave danger confronts both our worlds.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	267

Meanwhile out in the corridor, Mrs. Johnson advances with a load of 
cold beers and Birdseye burritos...passing by a figure frozen in the 
shadows...OUR POV: THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR.  Mrs. Johnson gone, none 
the wiser.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S STUDY - NIGHT	268

Mrs. Johnson entering, dropping some of her load in shock at the sight 
of beautiful John Emdall floating free in the center of the room...

MRS. JOHNSON
Oh, wow...

Reno picking her things up, as Mrs. Johnson backs away from the 
HOLOGRAM and sticks the burritos in a portable microwave oven in the 
corner of Buckaroo's desk...

	269
JOHN EMDALL
After a bloody reign of terror, the hated leader of our military caste, 
the self-proclaimed "Lord" Whorfin, a bloodthirsty butcher as evil as 
your Hitler was overthrown by freedom-loving forces, tried, and 
condemned, along with several hundred of his followers, to spend 
eternity in the formless void of the Eighth Dimension. Death was deemed 
too good for their ilk.

	270
RENO
Did you tell Penny Buckaroo wanted to see her?

MRS. JOHNSON
She's not in her room...I looked.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Will everybody please shut up so I can hear this thing?

	271
JOHN EMDALL
Were it not for the experiments of your father and Professor Hikita and 
the real Doctor Lizardo, then John Whorfin would still be locked safely 
away on another plane of existence.

	272
Rawhide and Pinky Carruthers holding a whispered conversation elsewhere 
in the room...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
"John Parker" I think he called himself, this Rasta man on a bike 
dressed up in aluminum foil.  With a weird album...how the hell was I 
supposed to know he came from outer space?

Buckaroo moving dangerously close to the HOLOGRAM...

John Emdall suddenly pointing right at the great man...	273

JOHN EMDALL
And now, you, Buckaroo Banzai, have unintentionally helped John Whorfin 
further with your Oscillation Overthruster! For our intelligence warns 
us that John Whorfin is about to make good his escape from Earth back 
through the Eighth Dimension...and on to Planet 10! If he should 
attempt this we will have no choice but to disrupt worldwide electronic 
communications and fire a particle beam weapon from your airspace to 
Smolensk, in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.

PERFECT TOMMY
An action the Kremlin will most certainly misinterpret as an American 
first strike!

JOHN EMDALL
Exactly, Perfect Tommy.  The Soviets will retaliate.  Your President 
Widmark will launch a massive counterforce strike...and within twenty 
minutes the danger to Planet 10 will be removed...

RENO
God, if it's not one thing it's another.

JOHN EMDALL
But...because we're good guys, we're giving you a chance to save your 
planet.  Stop John Whorfin before sunrise! If you fail we will be 
forced to help you destroy yourselves.  End of discussion.

	274
There's an awful pause...and then a SCREECH as John Emdall spirals 
downward into the grooves of the record again.

	275
CASPER LINDLEY
She gotta be kiddin', right? Vaporize the whole damn planet--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You wanna take the chance, Casper?

CASPER LINDLEY
Not me. No way.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula.  
Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!

Buckaroo heading for the door...

RENO
Where're you goin'?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To get my guns.

PERFECT TOMMY
His guns?  Holy shit.

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	276

...Professor Hikita and his assistant leaning over the electron tube 
apparatus, removing a rubber stopper from one of the receptacles, in 
the process GETTING AN ACCIDENTAL WHIFF of that BIZARRE GLOWING GREEN 
COMPOUND...Professor Hikita and assistant letting out gasps, seeing a 
sight that nearly stops their hearts...

THEIR POV	277

AT THE WINDOW...JOHN BIGBOOTÉ...AND A RED ARACHTOID!

	278
Professor Hikita, petrified, stepping back, grabbing the OSCILLATION 
OVERTHRUSTER and knocking over a chair, as THE ALIEN CREATURE smashes 
the window!

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDOR - NIGHT	279

Rawhide, hearing screams from the Professor's laboratory, races down 
the corridor, gun drawn...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	280

Buckaroo coming into his bedroom, opening a dresser drawer when 
suddenly...A NOISE BEHIND HIM!  Buckaroo whirling instinctively with 
twin EBONY HANDLED COLTS a fraction of a second from firing...at PENNY!

...the latter poking her head out of Buckaroo's closet just long enough 
to see him aim his silver pistols, jumping back into the closet, 
slamming the door...an exasperated Buckaroo stepping over to the 
closet, finding it locked...knocking...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open up or I'll shoot it off.

PENNY PRIDDY
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I 
thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like 
me.

Buckaroo understanding at last the reason for Penny's odd behavior, 
seeing THE PHOTOGRAPH on his bedstand of a younger, possibly not-yet-
so-world-famous Buckaroo Banzai in tuxedo...his pretty companion A DEAD 
RINGER FOR PENNY.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, look-

PENNY'S VOICE
You look.  Who is she?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
That's kinda complicated to get into right now because the world's 
maybe coming to an end and I can't stand here and talk to a closet 
door.

PENNY'S VOICE
Yeah, whose world is coming to an end?  You only wanted me because I 
remind you of her.

Buckaroo fidgeting, precious seconds ticking away...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny, I was going to get into that, but I haven't had time...with 
arachtoids and all...but briefly she was your long lost twin sister, we 
got married, and that's about all I can say.  Right now.
(no response)
Penny?

A silence from the other side, the closet door unlocking...slowly 
opening, revealing Penny standing in the middle of a pile of female 
clothing...

PENNY PRIDDY
Married--?  So that's it!  Buckaroo Banzai, a married man.  Where is 
she?  With the kids some place?

Buckaroo turning...Penny eyeing him, penetrating his soul...

PENNY PRIDDY
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like 
you...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was killed, Penny.

PENNY PRIDDY
Oh, my.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't go to pieces.  I haven't got time tonight.

A pregnant pause, the pain evident on Buckaroo's face as he turns back 
to the job at hand, picking up his holster and rummaging through the 
dresser drawer, fighting back the painful memories...

PENNY PRIDDY
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Where's my damn ammo?  Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around 
here!

PENNY PRIDDY
How did she die?  I wanna know.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You don't wanna know.

PENNY PRIDDY
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.

PENNY PRIDDY
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime 
League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of 
Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I wish he was.  He's real enough.

Penny having to sit down and think about this as Buckaroo straps on his 
guns...changes his torn and shredded jacket...Penny looking at a 
BUCKAROO BANZAI COMIC BOOK on the night stand...then at the framed 
photograph of Peggy...

PENNY PRIDDY
God, she's so young and beautiful.  I don't remember her at all.  Which 
I guess is good, under the circumstances.  I bet you'll never forget 
her though.

One look at Buckaroo says it all...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Never.

PENNY PRIDDY
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got 
mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.

PENNY PRIDDY
Go where?  Where're you going?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(squatting close to her)
Please, Penny.  You just gotta trust me now.  Okay?  And don't panic.  
Because it's gonna be all right.

PENNY PRIDDY
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.

PENNY PRIDDY
Believe in Penny Priddy?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Absolutely.

Penny looks into his eyes...

PENNY PRIDDY
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another 
adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go 
with you.  Please...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
It's too dangerous.

PENNY PRIDDY
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...

Starry-eyed, she leans forward to kiss him, Buckaroo about to oblige 
when their fingers touch, Penny getting a MILD ELECTRICAL SHOCK...

...the door suddenly opens and Perfect Tommy sticks his head in...
	281

PERFECT TOMMY
(breathless)
Buckaroo--! Sorry--

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is it, Tommy?

PERFECT TOMMY
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going 
haywire over at the lab...

Buckaroo running for the door, calling over his shoulder to Penny:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Stay here, I'll be back.

PENNY PRIDDY
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S HOUSE - NIGHT	282

Buckaroo, the Cavaliers, and the Lindleys race out of the house toward 
the research building...

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BEDROOM - NIGHT	283

Penny hurriedly changes clothes...puts on Peggy's clothes...when 
suddenly THE SIGHT OF JOHN O'CONNOR standing in the hallway door, 
leering at her...

PENNY PRIDDY
Whadda you want?

John O'Connor, remembering her from the press conference...

JOHN O'CONNOR
Nothing right now, Penny Priddy.

John O'Connor vanishing...Penny again at a loss...

INT.  BANZAI INSTITUTE - NIGHT	284

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers running inside, racing up a bright yellow 
staircase to the second floor...

INT.  INSTITUTE LABORATORY - NIGHT	285

Buckaroo and the Cavaliers entering, finding the motionless lab 
assistant in Professor Hikita's wrecked laboratory...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Dead.  Damnit!

PERFECT TOMMY
Where's the professor?

RENO
Where's Rawhide?

CASPER
Who'd do a thing like this?

NEW JERSEY
Arachtoids.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Spread out. They can't be far.

INT.  INSTITUTE CORRIDORS - NIGHT	286

SHOTS of Cavaliers in empty hallways, guns drawn, discovering evidence 
of intruders...OFFICES RANSACKED, FURNITURE UPSET...EXPERIMENTS FOULED 
UP...

	287
...Buckaroo turning a corner, finding a SMALL AMOUNT OF SMOKE in the 
hallway...turning the corner...

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	288

...stepping into a LARGE ROOM clouded with SMOKE from a burning file 
cabinet, Rawhide and a HULDING FORM struggling in the gloom...

...Buckaroo unable to get a clear shot at the beast when suddenly 
Rawhide succeeds in knocking his adversary to the floor, the "man" 
HISSING!

RAWHIDE
Look out, Buckaroo!

Rawhide putting himself in the line of fire, suddenly clutching his 
lower back...Buckaroo starting toward Rawhide but...

RAWHIDE
Behind you!

Buckaroo turning as THE SHADOW OF THE ALIEN JOHN O'CONNOR falls on his 
back!

...Buckaroo firing his guns, wounding the creature, the disoriented 
FIGURE retreating out into the corridor as Buckaroo turns in time to 
see Rawhide's assailant dive into a hole in the floor!  A hole in the 
floor?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You okay?

RAWHIDE
Yeah. Just grazed me.  The Professor's under the floor too...with the 
Overthruster...

Buckaroo edging toward that strange orifice in the linoleum, going into 
it himself...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT	289

As Penny rushes in, her ears picking up weird noises...THE SOUND OF 
PEOPLE in the acoustical tiles overhead...Penny trying to follow the 
racket down the first-floor hallway...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	290

Buckaroo in the dim light of the crawl space, making his way past air-
conditioning ducts toward the sound of someone or something crawling up 
ahead...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Professor--!?

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Here, Buckaroo!

SOUNDS IN THE DARKNESS, Buckaroo holding his pistol still at the ready 
but useless in these cramped quarters...Buckaroo finding a worklight, 
flicking it on...

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	291

Penny meanwhile following the NOISES AND VOICES OVERHEAD into an empty 
office, grabbing a ladder and knocking out a ceiling panel...

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo!  Rawhide!  Reno?  Anybody?

	292
ANOTHER POV...unfortunately someone else is watching Penny from inside 
that very office...the wounded John O'Connor sitting in a swivel desk 
chair behind the door, oozing blood of a strange color and consistency, 
staring ferociously at Penny...MORE CLATTER OVERHEAD...as Penny 
elevates herself partially into the hole...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	293

PENNY'S POV...Professor Hikita only yards away, on his belly, able to 
come no further, unable to wedge himself beneath a large duct...the 
arachtoid John Bigbooté closing in behind the professor...Buckaroo 
closing in behind Bigbooté.

PROF.  HIKITA
Take it, young lady!  Grab it!

	294
Unseen by John Bigbooté, the OVERTHRUSTER skittering across the crawl 
space and into Penny's hands!

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS OFFICE - NIGHT	295

Penny stepping down off the chair and onto the desk top, her back still 
to the wounded John O'Connor as she quickly stuffs the OVERTHRUSTER 
into her purse...an action unseen by the ghastly, bleeding thug who...

	296
...EXTENDS HIS ARM UP AND ACROSS THE ROOM...HIS HUMAN HAND TIGHTENING 
AROUND HER MOUTH...

INT.  CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT	297

Buckaroo advancing toward the professor...

PROF. HIKITA'S VOICE
Go back, Buckaroo!

The arachtoid John Bigbooté whirling, firing a STINGER that whizzes 
past Buckaroo's head, missing by inches...as Buckaroo FIRES 
twice...John Bigbooté screaming...kicking at a small fresh air vent, 
somehow squeezing his huge body out the tiny opening like a rat.

INT.  DRAFTING ROOM - NIGHT	298

Buckaroo helping Professor Hikita up out of the floor...Rawhide lying 
very still now, surrounded by Reno, Perfect Tommy and New Jersey...

...one look between New Jersey and Buckaroo sufficient to tell us that 
Rawhide hasn't got a chance...Buckaroo kneeling beside his old pal, 
Rawhide forcing a smile...

RAWHIDE
You're a welcome sight...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Just 'grazed' you, huh?

New Jersey extracting a strange MANY-PRONGED STINGER from Rawhide's 
back.  Buckaroo looking at it...Rawhide maintaining a sense of humor...

RAWHIDE
Apache?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Arachtoid.

RAWHIDE
So I was right.  That's nice to know...

Across the room, Pinky Carruthers comes in with Casper and Scooter 
Lindley, and that black man from Planet 10, John Parker...

PINKY CARRUTHERS
We found the guy, Rawhide, sucker dug a hole and tried to...

Pinky's words catching in his throat as he sees Rawhide's condition.

	299
Buckaroo turning, seeing not a 'guy' but A GIANT ARACHTOID standing 
there...

	300
Rawhide fading fast, Buckaroo lobbing the STINGER to "John Parker"...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Any antidote for these things?

John Parker holding the stinger in his palm...

JOHN PARKER
No, none.

...as it suddenly comes alive!  He drops it to the floor, stomps it to 
death...

PERFECT TOMMY
That mean you're on our side?

RAWHIDE
(sinking)
We gotta stop 'em, Buckaroo.

Buckaroo turning from the BLACK ARACHTOID to his dying buddy...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
We will, old fried, we will.

RAWHIDE
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...

BUT RAWHIDE CLOSING HIS EYES FOR THE FINAL TIME, as Buckaroo feels for 
a pulse...the look in the great man's eyes saying it all...sadness 
mixed with anger...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
There's another one we owe 'em.

...THE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER STARTING UP...

CASPER LINDLEY
They're stealing my chopper!

The Cavaliers racing for the window...

RENO
And they got Penny!  Look!

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Don't shoot!

PROF. HIKITA
She has the Overthruster!

JOHN PARKER
Then your planet is doomed.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No!
(calmer)
We'll get it back.

Buckaroo shoving Perfect Tommy aside, at the window himself now.

	301
BUCKAROO'S POV...a fleeting glimpse of THE STOLEN LINDLEY CHOPPER...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	302

CLOSE ON the familiar face of the Secretary of Defense seen from an 
unusual angle...PULLING BACK TO REVEAL PRESIDENT WIDMARK lying on his 
belly, surrounded by the electronics of his temporary set of 
government, staring down at a special mirror that reflects his 
Secretary of Defense, the Secretary pressing a point further an 
igniting a Camel with a lighter from the President's nightstand.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
It's not Buckaroo Banzai per se, Mr. President. It's his men...some of 
then foreigners...Asiatics, their names changed, their true backgrounds 
shrouded in secrecy! I mean, when you come right up against it, what do 
we really know about any of 'em?

A NURSE appears with two little pills...

NURSE
These'll make you a tenny bit drowsy, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That's okay, Bonnie, I won't be operating any heavy machinery today.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(desperate)
We've never had a weapon like the Jet Car in the past, Mr. President.  
Light-weight, highly mobile, stick on some anti-tank missiles, a couple 
grenade launchers, hell, we could buy ourselves two hundred Jet Cars 
for the price of ten tanks, send 'em swarming all over Ivan like bumble 
bees, sir, right clear through their precious little Iron Curtain like 
it was Swiss cheese!  They gotta be just scared shitless!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
As are all sane men today.

SECREATRY OF DEFENSE
Hey, and me too.  That's why I'm saying until Buckaroo Banzai agrees to 
submit his boys to at least a routine government security check, that 
Jet Car should be in the hands of Defense, and if they won't sell us 
the technology, then Mr. President, by God, sir, we have got to take 
it!  In the national interest.

The lighter in the Secretary's hand suddenly BEEPING, startling him and 
prompting the President to claim the gizmo and point it at...

	303
...an astounding TV-telephone where the FACE OF BUCKAROO BANZAI 
APPEARS...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
World Watch One.  Direct incoming transmission.

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Hello, Mr. President.  How's my favorite patient?  Any tenderness?

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
That which does not kill us makes us stronger, Buckaroo.  What's it 
like out there in the real world?

Secretary of Defense McKinley stepping around behind the bed, coming 
into Buckaroo's field of vision...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Not too terrific, sir.  I apologize for the interruption but something 
very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like 
the Earth's caught in a crossfire.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're gonna have to repeat that, I think, Buckaroo.

EXT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	304

On a highway somewhere near the Eastern seaboard, Buckaroo's bus speeds 
toward Yoyodyne...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	305

Buckaroo standing at a TV-telephone in his MOBILE ELECTRONIC NERVE 
CENTER, the arachtoidal John Parker right at his side amid a flurry of 
activity... technicians accumulating INFO on THE ALIEN FATHER SHIP FROM 
PLANET 10...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
To cut right to the bottom line on this, sir, we have reason to believe 
that there are moving freely among us, vicious red aliens disguised as 
the owners and operators of Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems.

...Perfect Tommy, Reno, even Casper Lindley, coming in and out of the 
picture, transforming themselves into a crack commando unit donning 
assault/chemical-warfare uniforms...little Scooter Lindley among them, 
too, doing like his dad.

	306
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Yoyodyne Propulsion?  The people working on our Truncheon bomber?  
Under control of alien nationals?  Reds?  Commies, you say?

	307
...New Jersey studying an initial computer enhancement of THE AWESOME 
BLACK ARACHTOID SHIP HEADED TOWARD EARTH...

	308
BUCKAROO BANZAI
Not exactly, Mr. Secretary, no.  Real aliens.  Giant red arachtoids 
camouflaged as human beings...and what they're really building, forget 
your Truncheon bomber, Mr. Secretary, is this enormous rocketship to 
escape back through the Eighth Dimension and then on to Planet 10.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Now wait one second...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The gentleman standing here with me is called John Parker, and he can 
corroborate everything I've said because he's from Planet 10 too.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	309

The President dumbfounded...John Parker on TV appearing as nothing more 
than a wild and wooly Rastafarian...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo...you and I, we go back a long, long way together...but...

JOHN PARKER ON TV
(interrupting)
Time is short, Mr. President. To prevent John Whorfin's escape, my 
comrades are at this moment taking up a geostationary position over New 
Jersey. This situation is explosive!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Explosive? What are you saying, man? Some kind of race war in New 
Jersey--?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
No, sir.  This 'man' as you call him, is not a human being, Mr. 
President.  He's a black arachtoid.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's some kind of spider, isn't it?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	310

New Jersey joins Professor Hikita at a microscope, analyzing a slide 
smeared with that weird alien 'blood'...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Buckaroo, my good friend...I'd like to help you...but don't you think I 
would've heard from my SAC radar by now if...

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	311

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
SAC wouldn't know what to look for, sir.  Because these black 
arachtoids are cleverly hidden inside a huge thundercloud.

The Secretary of Defense takes action, picks up a phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Get me John Bigboote at Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems, Inc.  Then...
(to the President)
...the FBI.  Let's see if this spade's wanted.  What the hell's his 
name again?  Jackson?

JOHN PARKER ON TV
Parker.  I have delivered a hologram from my president, John Emdall, 
who has made it clear that unless John Whorfin is destroyed at once, 
she intends to fire an atomic beam from your American airspace...

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
...hit Smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, Mr. President.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
A what?

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
A thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  These creatures from Planet 10 are 
ready to exploit Soviet-American tensions and get us to blow each other 
off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
You're quite serious about this, aren't you, Buckaroo.  We know each 
other pretty well, I think.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
John...?  John Bigboote?  Right, Bigbooté, sorry.  Anyway, hey, guy, 
how's everything over there at Yoyodyne?  How's my big bomber coming?  
Nothing out of the, you know, ordinary?  Spiders?  I know you're 
busy...lunch?  Sounds good...when's good for you?  Next Tuesday?  I'm 
writing it down in my book.  See you then...Uncle Sam's treat.

The Secretary writes nothing down, hangs up, looking unsatisfied with 
the conversation just concluded.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	312

Buckaroo glancing over at Professor Hikita and New Jersey, the latter 
squinting into the microscope...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK ON TV
Well.  I don't know what to say, Buckaroo...aliens from Planet 10, 
nuclear extortion, spiders in thunder clouds, a girl named "John"...

NEW JERSEY
There's your answer!  Electromagnetic bacterial crap!

PROF. HIKITA
Programmable!

NEW JERSEY
We inhale the bacteria.  It swims to our cerebral cortex and reprograms 
our consciousness.  Diabolical.  We only see what they want us to see.

PROF. HIKITA
Electric brainwashing.

John Parker nearby, helping Reno synthesize more of Professor Hikita's 
ARACHTOIDAL ANTIDOTE and pour the liquid into GAS MASK FILTERS...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE McKINLEY STEPPING CLOSER INTO THE PICTURE...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE ON TV
Just curious, Buckaroo, but where's the Jet Car at these days?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got it, Mr. Secretary.  But unfortunately the Oscillation 
Overthruster is in Penny Priddy's possession and she's been kidnapped 
and taken to Yoyodyne, further exacerbating the situation. We're on our 
way there right now.

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	313

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Who the hell's Penny Priddy?

The Secretary of Defense giving the President a sly 'I told you so' 
look...

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - NIGHT	314

Perfect Tommy coming over, interrupting...

PERFECT TOMMY
Buckaroo, John Parker has the arachtoid cloud on line 2!

INT.  WALTER REED ARMY HOSPITAL - NIGHT	315

BUCKAROO BANZAI ON TV
Excuse me a moment, Mr. President.  We're talking to the cloud right 
now.

And his image fades.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Good God...

The President picks up the phone...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well, if it wasn't Buckaroo Banzai, I'd say commit the man.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Get me SAC HQ: Omaha, NORAD, and the Strategic Space Command. I want 
some hard data on that cloud. We got any killer satellites over Jersey-
-?

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAY	316

Everyone studying a much MORE DETAILED COMPUTER ENHANCEMENT of the 
alien cloud...

The Alien John Parker on the phone, whispering...	317

RENO 
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
(to John Parker)
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.

JOHN PARKER
(into phone)
Buckaroo Banzai says patience is a virtue, Wing Commander, sir.

Perfect Tommy interrupting again, holding yet another telephone...

PERFECT TOMMY
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?

INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	318

Meanwhile in a grimy narrow control booth high above the factory floor, 
a terrified Penny Priddy sits BOUND and GAGGED, John O'Connor SPREADING 
THE CONTENTS FROM A HONEY-BEAR SQUEEZE BOTTLE over her naked arms while 
long trails of ORDINARY PICNIC ANTS make their way up her legs...John 
Bigbooté looking on...

Penny's UNOPENED big clear plastic purse on Doctor Lizardo's desk, the 
OVERTHRUSTER right under his nose and he doesn't even know it as he 
speaks into the phone handed to him by an ASSISTANT.  BEGIN 
INTERCUTTING.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Well, well...Dr. Banzai. Perhaps you don't remember me?  Ah, I'm 
flattered.  We know the same people.  In fact, one of them is here with 
me now...your associate, Doctor Penny Priddy.

	319
BUCKAROO BANZAI
"Doctor"--?

	320
DOCTOR LIZARDO
May I pass along my congratulations for your great achievement.  In the 
miserable annals of the Earth, you will be duly enshrined! However...
(a pause)
...Miss Priddy claims to be unable to solve my problem. And provide the 
crucial missing circuit for my Overthruster.  Perhaps you can convince 
her to try.

Lizardo holding the phone toward Penny, ripping her gag off...

PENNY PRIDDY
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me! 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny--?!  Are you all right?

Doctor Lizardo yanking the phone from Penny, remaining silent for a 
second to torture Buckaroo's soul...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
She knows nothing, Lizardo.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Then shall we say "A Penny for your thoughts?" You can come in her 
place. Yoyodyne, Dr. Banzai. Come alone, with your Overthruster!
(hanging up)
He'll bring it.  I know his type.

Penny glancing surreptitiously at her large transparent purse, THE 
OVERTHRUSTER IN A JUMBLE OF COSMETICS!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Take her to the pit!  Use more honey.  Find out what she knows.

Smiling smugly, Lizardo heads for the door, Penny squirming in her seat 
as the TINY ANTS dig in...

PENNY PRIDDY
Who are you?  Hanoi Shan?  The Scourge of Burma!  The Pivot of Mystery?  
Well, you're not destroying me like you did my sister!

Lizardo simply sneering at her as he goes out the door...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUS - NIGHT	321

A flurry of well-ordered activity taking place...Hong Kong Cavaliers 
and Blue Shield Irregulars along with Pinky Carruthers.  Casper and 
Scooter...sitting up front like paratroopers, cleaning their back-pack 
FLAMETHROWERS...SAWED-OFF SHOTGUNS...Buckaroo giving them a chalk talk, 
an aerial photograph of Yoyodyne on the clear plexiglas 'blackboard'...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see 
them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't 
be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker.  But just remember...if we 
fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.

JOHN PARKER
They will never surrender.  They will fight to the end.

Buckaroo nodding...THE CAVALIERS BREATING THEIR ANTIDOTE FILTERS, 
SEEING NOW "THE ALIEN" JOHN PARKER WITH A MIXTURE OF DISBELIEF AND 
HORROR...Casper and Scooter Lindley especially unsettled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I'm working under the assumption that Penny still has the Overthruster.  
That'll be my job: get it back in one piece.  Here's the main gate.  
I'll pass through first, alone.  The rest of you divide into two strike 
groups-Apache Team...that's you, Reno...and Chaparral Team, Perfect 
Tommy.  John Parker'll ride with Chaparral.

Perfect Tommy not too thrilled about that.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Top priority is the Overthruster. Whorfin can't escape without it. The 
built-in tracking device should make it relatively simple to 
locate...maybe hard to get.

INT.  BOWELS OF YOYODYNE - NIGHT	322

Penny being dragged by John O'Connor through a slimy underground 
corridor, past a strange piece of machinery.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL - NIGHT	323

The President of the United States talks into a cigarette lighter and 
peeks up a nurse's skirt by means of his floor mirror...

	324
MIRRORED POV:  The nurse's reflection replaced by that of his NATIONAL 
SECURITY ADVISOR...

	325
PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Buckaroo, come in...over.  How does this damn thing work?  Can anybody 
figure this lighter out?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
No, sir.  I think the flint...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
What's happening with my call to SAC?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They 
report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Jammed--? By who? Whom by?

NATIONAL SECURITY MAN
Possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  It's unusual, but no 
cause for alarm.  Intelligence reports the Soviets are having the same 
problem.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Should we be on Code Red?

GENERAL CATBURD
We go to Code Red, the Russians go to Code Red...no sense jumping off 
half-cocked, Mr. President.

The President twisting around to glower at Catburd eating an orange, 
sitting near a table of flowers and fruit baskets.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
I don't know...Buckaroo Banzai's never been wrong before.

Senator Cunningham pacing nervously...

GENERAL CATBURD
The man went through solid matter, for crying out loud. Who knows what 
it did to his brain...maybe scrambled his molecules. All I'm saying is, 
let's not panic here!  I'm sure there's a rational explanation...

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(turning from a strange phone)
Russian radar is down, sir.  They've just gone to Code Red.

Silence.  And then calmly and quietly:

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
We've got no choice then.  Call my wife.

The National Security Advisor turning back to his telephone:

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Code Red.  "Butch says we're crimson."

GENERAL CATBURD
Mr. President, none of us here are lunatics or irrational men...
(looking at Cunningham)
...or persons.  I'm a soldier and I'm a damn good one, enough 
decorations to snap a Christmas tree, but I don't mind telling you, I'm 
sure I speak for everyone in this room when I say I am scared. I'm 
barely holding my fudge right now.

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
Stop acting like a goddamn schoolgirl, General, and pull yourself 
together.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
I'm glad someone has the balls to face facts!
(pause)
Forget we're the good guys and we'd never attack first.  They think 
we're godless monsters just like them.  Put yourself in their 
samovars...sitting in the dark without radar, bells ringing all over 
the damn Kremlin, little men in fedora hats getting out of Zils, coming 
into the Great Hall of the People.  Now, do you think they're gonna 
listen to reason?  I'll give Buckaroo his Planet 10 space cloud, but do 
you think they will?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
(being handed a dispatch)
Soviet radar is down, sir, and so is ours.  We're both totally 
defenseless.  More or less.

GENERAL CATBURD
Hail Mary.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
So what's our counter option, General Catburd?  Earn your salary.

GENERAL CATBURD
I guess we have to prick this boil and take the heat, sir.  Hit 'em 
primero...blast 'em off the face of the Earth before they lose their 
heads and do it to us first.

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Larry, where's my Football?

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
Out in the hall, sir.

INT.  WALTER REED HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT	326

An apple-cheeked Marine Lieutenant sits watching a television soap 
opera, only the sinister BLACK BRIEFCASE chained to his wrist setting 
him apart from missions of other viewers...General Catburd sticking his 
head out of the President's room...

GENERAL CATBURD
What're you waiting for, boy?  Get in here with that thing.

...as an out-of-breath Mrs. Johnson rounds the corner on rollerskates, 
out-foxing SECRET SERVICE AGENTS and the rest of the President's 
entourage, cutting through, clutching the YELLOW RECORD...

MRS. JOHNSON
For the President!  From Buckaroo Banzai!

EXT.  RENDEZVOUS POINT - NIGHT	327

A dimly lighted parking lot not far from Yoyodyne.  A KOLODNY BROS. 
PLUMBING VAN arrives, disgorging several tough BLUE SHIELDS as Buckaroo 
and Professor Hikita confer...the alien John Parker doing some highly 
unusual warm-up exercises on the tarmac...Reno telling the arriving 
Blue Shields:

RENO
We're waiting for the Jet Car.  Billy's bringing it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Asshole probably got lost.

NEW JERSEY
Or nailed for speeding.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Can I have everyone's attention?  I'm not a rah-rah kinda guy, and I'm 
not much for speeches, but things could get rough out there tonight.  
It's a fight we didn't ask for, but it's a fight we're stuck with and 
we all saw what happened to Rawhide.  So if for any reason this is 
good-bye, I want you all to know that...well...that...you crazy lugs...

Buckaroo finding it difficult to put into words what they all mean to 
him, the Cavaliers smiling, needling him...

RENO
What, Buckaroo?  You trying to tell us something?

The JET CAR racing up, skidding to a stop, Billy jumping out, the big 
engine still running.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Let's just fry those arachtoids.

Buckaroo embracing Professor Hikita, turning back to his men, pulling 
on his helmet:

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Give me thirty minutes.  Then come in and mop up.

Buckaroo tossing a quick Blue Shield salute, shutting himself into his 
speed machine.

CLOSE ON THE PRESIDENT'S FACE...JOHN EMDALL'S VOICE OVER...talking 
thermonuclear war...wrapping her speech up...WHOOSH!

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
Well... that's certainly food for thought.

	331
Mrs. Johnson lifting the needle off the SMOKING RECORD...as the 
President's National Security Advisor places a call on that ominous 
STRANGE PHONE, a palpable tension rising, urgency bordering on panic...

...General Catburd and the young Marine lieutenant rummaging through a 
confusion of envelops in the BLACK BRIEFCASE.

NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR
No answer at the Kremlin, sir. Just dead silence.

GENERAL CATBURD
Here you go, Mr. President...the Sealed Authenticators.  The Plan D 
Documents for your eyes only...John-Hancock these, and we got ourselves 
a knockout little force posture...

SENATOR CUNNINGHAM
You know, on second thought, maybe we should think this through a bit 
more so that future generations of...

THE LIGHTS IN THE ROOM START TO BLINK ON AND OFF...silencing the 
Senator...Catburd handing the President a writing implement...pulling 
out a special writing tray from the bed...

PRESIDENT WIDMARK
"Name of the enemy"?  What, Planet 10?  My hand's shaking.  How on 
earth can I even...have to stay awake, alert...that's my job.  That's 
what the people put me here for.

INT.  SPEED OPERATOR'S PULPIT (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	334

In the nerve center of Yoyodyne, a nervous John Bigbooté watches Dr. 
Lizardo addressing his ragtag followers on the floor below...Bigbooté 
with his hands on Lizardo's mike cord, trying to get up enough nerve to 
pull the plug on his boss...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Blacks are on this planet! Here in New Jersey! Coming to destroy us! We 
must move! Escape or die! 

	335
OVER LIZARDO'S SHOULDER: A view down below on the littered floor of a 
huge aircraft factory that houses a GIANT SPOACESHIP OF BIZARRE DESIGN, 
a customized 747, wingless, jagged, the entire vehicle suspended twenty 
feet off the floor on movable cranes, work ladders stretching up to its 
several doors...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You must work faster to finish the Great Vehicle. So that we can enter 
the Eighth Dimension and free our trapped comrades! So we can return to 
our homeland and seize power once again! 

...Lizardo's followers extending their three-fingered hands in fascist 
salutes as he whips them into a feverish state:

BACK TO:	336

DR. LIZARDO
Where are we going?  Tell me!

RED ARACHTOIDS

DR. LIZARDO
When?

RED ARACHTOIDS
Real soon!

The Jet Car's engine shut down, Buckaroo CHECKING HIS OVERTHRUSTER 
HOMING DEVICE as he's trundled toward John Gomez, in a graveyard of 
HUGE YELLOW SPIKES, his eyes taking in everything, from the last-minute 
preparation of the GIANT SPACECRAFT to:

BUCKAROO'S POV...the evil figures of Dr. Lizardo and John Bigbooté 
standing high in the speed operator's pulpit...

	340
Buckaroo yanked out of the cockpit...John Gomez poking at the JET CAR'S 
dashboard, ripping out its cassette deck, finding the crucial 
Overthruster missing and shaking his head in Lizardo's direction.

JOHN GOMEZ
Not here!

An angry John Bigbooté racing down the stairs toward the Jet Car...as 
over the PUBLIC ADDRESS BOOMS:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
WHERE IS THE OVERTHRUSTER!

BACK TO:	342

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I thought you had it!

For that seemingly flippant but honest answer, Buckaroo gets punched by 
John Bigbooté...doubling him over...

Murky, dank, an insect paradise...Buckaroo standing trapped inside an

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Solve them! The shock tower is a lie detector. Any untruth triggers a 
brutal charge to your auditory meatus...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You're not getting a damn thing outta me until Penny's safe.

DR. LIZARDO
Curse you, Banzai! Don't you realize what you're saying? Your planet's 
about to be destroyed, and you're wasting time like this...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
I've got nothing but time.

CLOSE ON THE POLYGRAPH NEEDLE SUDDENLY JUMPING!	344

	345
THE TOWER ZAPPING BUCKAROO, A FIERCE ELECTRIC SHOCK TOSSING HIM BACK 
AND FORTH LIKE A RAG DOLL...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Sealed with a curse as sharp as a knife...doomed is your soul, and 
damned is your life!

Lizardo pressing a button, administering a second SHOCK to Buckaroo, 
while an aide turns a dial, INCREASING THE VOLTAGE

DOCTOR LIZARDO
I want my missing circuit now!

INT/EXT.  PRESIDENT'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT	346

A VIEW OVER THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE'S SHOULDER as the chopper 
descends, lands in a parking lot where Buckaroo's bus sits guarded by 
Cavaliers and Blue Shields...THE CAMERA FOLLOWING the Secretary right 
out into it all...A CARPET CLEANING VAN ARRIVING, THREE MORE TOUGH BLUE 
SHIELD IRREGULARS REPORTING FOR WORK..."THE RUG SUCKERS".

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Who the hell are those guys?  Where's Buckaroo?

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	347

Buckaroo still held in his electric straitjacket...Lizardo nodding to 
the ARACHTOID in charge of a bank of glowing closed circuit TV 
sets...the same picture popping onto every set:  PENNY HANGING IN "THE 
PIT".

BUCKAROO BANZAI
You bloody--!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
She'll live...for a while, and she won't enjoy it.

Lizardo indicates his favorite monitor...the INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER 
equation flashing across its face.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Only you can save her from the fate of your friend, Mr. Rawhide!  Solve 
this equation.  I must have the crucial missing circuit.

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR...a riot of circuits and junctions...	348

BACK TO:	349

BUCKAROO BANZAI
The missing circuit's in your head, Whorfin.

DR. LIZARDO
Whorfin?  How do you know that's my real name?

BUCKAROO BANZAI
John Emdall told me.

Buckaroo smiles at Lizardo's surprise, Lizardo signaling John Bigbooté 
who turns on the voltage, ZAPPING Buckaroo!

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS (PARKED) - NIGHT	350

The Secretary of Defense pacing the aisle of the bus, looking at his 
watch while the Cavaliers and newly arrived Blue Shields conceal their 
eagerness for battle...checking watches, cleaning weapons.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Anybody got a report-anybody got anything?  Or are we still blacked 
out?

Perfect Tommy looking back into World Watch One...

PERFECT TOMMY
Light precipitation.  Partly cloudy tomorrow.

SECREATARY OF DEFENSE
This bus should be in the hands of Defense.

...Scooter Lindley, wearing a gas mask, approaches the alien John 
Parker with a BLUE SHIELD BALLPOINT PEN and a piece of paper...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Could I have your autograph, Mr. Parker?

John Parker at first not understanding the nature of the 
request...looking at the ball-point pen, Scooter flipping the point for 
him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Say, "To my best friend Scooter..."

JOHN PARKER
You got it.

...the Secretary of Defense, NERVOUSLY CRACKING HIS KNUCKLES...moving 
up the aisle, suddenly screaming:

SCRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell are we doing?!  I don't believe this...what're we waiting 
for?  Christmas?

PROF. HIKITA
(checking his watch)
Ten minutes more.  Buckaroo's orders.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Damn Buckaroo!  I'm the eyes and ears of the President of these United 
States of America!  In loco presidentis!  Which means I'm in charge 
here!

PERFECT TOMMY
Not on this bus, you're not.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Who the hell do you think you are?

PERFECT TOMMY
Perfect Tommy.

That answer alone enough to drive the Secretary up the wall...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Well let me tell you something, Mr. Perfect Tommy: I don't need this 
shit.  I could be on Easy Street with a cushy job in the private 
sector.  But instead,  I got me a nine-hundred-million-dollar way-the-
hell-behind-schedule top-secret bomber being built down there by 
Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and I don't intend to set twiddling thumbs 
in a bus while Buckaroo Banzai goes crashing around my airplane looking 
for his damn girlfriend, driving a car that itself is probably worth 
more to this country than all the tea in China!  I'm talking National 
Security risk and we are going in there like gentlemen and straighten 
this thing out before somebody gets hurt!  You got that?

...the Secretary suddenly grabbing a weapon from a surprised Blue 
Shield and turning it toward the driver...

REVERSE ANGLE...THE SECRETARY CRACKING A SHOT OFF AT THE WINDSHIELD!
	351

	352
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Hit it, soldier boy!  Move this buggy!  That's a goddamn executive 
order!

With his weapon trained on the driver, who's to stop him?

PERFECT TOMMY
Go ahead, Louie, do like the man says.

EXT.  HIGHWAY NEAR YOYODYNE - NIGHT	353

The double bus leaping forward, heading down the long approach road to 
Yoyodyne...past a BILLBOARD touting the aerospace achievements 
of...YOYODYNE-AN EXCITING, GROWING COMPANY...JUST ONE MILE 
AHEAD...PATROLLED BY AIRCRAFT.

INT.  BUCKAROO'S BUS - NIGHT	354

The Cavaliers letting the Secretary of Defense call the shots for the 
moment, talking among themselves, Perfect Tommy squelching any notion 
of knocking off their hysterical hijacker:

PERFECT TOMMY
(whispering)
Hey, so we get into action quicker this way.  We tell Buckaroo our 
watches were fast.

Ordinary citizen John Parker taking a step toward the Secretary, 
offering him a gas mask...the Secretary turning on him...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
That's far enough, black boy...

A mystified John Parker stepping back.

	355
ANGLE TOWARD WINDSHIELD...the Secretary peering through the windshield 
at the chain link gates coming into view...YOYODYNE-AN EQUAL 
OPPORTUNITY EMPLOYER.

REVERSE ON	356

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I'll handle the negotiations here...
(to the driver)
Slow her down.

EXT.  GUARD GATE/YOYODYNE - NIGHT	357

The Secretary getting out, coming around to the REDHEADED YOYODYNE 
GUARDS who try to peer in through the bus' tinted windows...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
You fellas got a phone?  Ring ahead and get me John Bigboote.  Tell 
him...

GUARD
It's Bigbooté.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What? Hell, I'll do it yourself if I want it done right, huh?

The Secretary pushing the astonished guards aside and picking up the 
telephone, the guards trying to stop him and in the process turning 
their backs on the bus as it SILENTLY CRUISES PAST THE GATE INTO 
YOYODYNE...

EXT.  DESERTED AREAS (YOYODYNE) - NIGHT	358

...the bus coming to a stop in a scrap metal dump inside the big 
compound, Cavaliers and Blue Shields piling out, going with their 
assigned groups...Perfect Tommy's Chaparral Team following John Parker 
toward a normal looking building...

JOHN PARKER
Under here, I think.

PERFECT TOMMY
Under where?  Hold on...

But John Parker entering a crawl space beneath the huge 
building...Chaparral Team having no choice, following.

EXT.  YOYODYNE GATE - NIGHT	359

The Secretary of Defense struggling with the guards for possession of 
the phone, drawing his stolen weapon...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Now you get this straight...you're up to your ass in alligators, and 
I'm here to drain the swamp.  So I'm gonna use this phone...because it 
is all over for you, Baby Blue...
(picking up the phone)
This is the Secretary of Defense at the poorly guarded west gate.  I 
wanna speak to John Bigbooté, person to person.  Okay, okay...Bigbooté.

EXT.  UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE/YOYODYNE - NIGHT	360

Reno's Apache Team (Casper and Scooter on board), finds yet ANOTHER 
UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE to the main building, slips in...

INT.  UNDERGROUND BUILDING - NIGHT	361

Chaparral Team (the alien, John Parker, Perfect Tommy) in the strange 
labyrinth of dark, low-ceilinged passageways, making their way 
cautiously...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hope you know where you're going, John Parker.  Because my nose is 
starting to whistle...

A FORM suddenly dropping from the ceiling, landing on Perfect Tommy, a 
fierce struggle in the darkness...John Parker to the rescue, garroting 
a RED ARACHTOID, Perfect Tommy helping himself up...

PERFECT TOMMY
Thanks.

JOHN PARKER
Don't mention it.

PERFECT TOMMY
Then I won't.

INT.  BIVOUAC ROOM - NIGHT	362

...John Parker leading the way again, up some unusual stairs...into the 
MAIN BIVOUAC ROOM, RED ARACHTOIDS apparently asleep in bizarre tents, 
others hanging from the ceiling like sloths, A STRANGE HEAVY HUMMING 
NOISE starting to fill the room...

JOHN PARKER
They sense us.  Hurry.

John Parker breaking into a run for the far end of the room, Perfect 
Tommy and the others following, John Parker hitting the door...and AN 
ALARM GOES OFF...Perfect Tommy opening fire at a HUGE GENERATOR...THE 
POWER DROPPING EVERYWHERE!

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	363

LIGHTS PULSING...ELECTIRICITY FAILING in the murky torture chamber 
giving Buckaroo just the change he needs to break free of the shock 
tower.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Stop him!  Get him!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	364

Buckaroo ducking into a recessed doorway, taking cover against a wall 
wet with strange algae as various ARACHTOID GUARDS scramble past, ALARM 
BELLS AND SIRENS GROANING...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
(to Bigbooté)
Kill the girl! 

...Buckaroo losing sight of the swift arachtoid John Bigbooté, 
resorting instead to his ELECTRONIC TRACKING DEVICE while...

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	365

...Reno, New Jersey and Pinky Carruthers bring Apache Team down a 
flooded corridor, meeting some opposition.

INT.  DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT	366

Buckaroo spotting New Jersey in the confusion, the two of them tracking 
Penny electronically, descending concrete steps, moving down a dark 
corridor that we recognize...

INT.  LAUNCH HANGER - NIGHT	367

The Secretary of Defense meanwhile reaching the big hangar, confused, 
alarmed, chaos everywhere, shouting over the din:

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote!

...spotting John Bigbooté across the hangar floor, going after him, 
staring bug-eyed at the MONSTROUS-LOOKING SPACECRAFT suspended above 
the hangar floor...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell...that ain't no Truncheon bomber, my friend.  I never 
approved that!

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	368

The Secretary following the speedy John Bigbooté around a bend, unable 
to keep up...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote!

Bigbooté giving no indication of seeing him, rounding a corner ducking 
into his office...

...the Secretary rounding the corner too but seeing no sign of 
Bigbooté...instead just an office door, a nameplate reading JOHN 
BIGBOOTÉ, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT...the Secretary of Defense opening 
the door...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	369

...moving past a vacant receptionist's desk to John Bigbooté's 
cavernous, strangely furnished chamber...EMPTY.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Bigboote?!  You can run, but you can't hide.  I want some facts!

...but no sign of John Bigbooté.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	370

Buckaroo and New Jersey still tracking Penny, moving through another 
flooded, slimy corridor we remember...

INT.  BIGBOOTÉ'S OFFICE - NIGHT	371

...the Secretary spying a phone on the receptionist's desk amid 
scattered Oreo cookies, picking the phone up, clicking it a couple of 
times to get a dial tone...totally ignoring AN AMAZING FRAMED PICTURE 
OF A RED ARACHTOID MOTHER AND CHILD ON THE DESK RIGHT IN FRONT OF 
HIM...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Operator...operator...how the hell does a person get an outside line 
around here?

...his gaze now focusing squarely on that cheap framed photograph of 
the RED ARACHTOIDS...Secretary McKinley losing his bearings...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Oh, Lord.  Never mind...forget it...

...his mind reeling, refusing to accept the obvious, the oddly designed 
furniture and chairs in the room, somehow insect-like...a sudden 
sound...a WOMAN'S SCREAM that seems to come from...underneath the 
floor?

...the Secretary cocking his weapon and stepping around the desk as an 
amazing thing occurs...A TRAPDOOR IN THE OFFICE FLOOR opening, the 
Secretary going to investigate, able to observe...

	372
HIS POV of...John O'Connor coming up a ladder and, in the room below, a 
barely conscious Penny still in her private hell, trussed and taped, 
ANTS CRAWLING ON HER ARMS...the lurid specter of John Bigbooté staring 
at her...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	373

PENNY'S CLEAR PLASTIC PURSE UNOPENED ON THE DESK BESIDE HER, as the 
Secretary of Defense suddenly knocks John O'Connor down the ladder and 
jumps into the room, injuring his ankle...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
What the hell's is going on here, Bigboote? Where's my bomber? 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
That's 'Bigbooté'.

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
I don't give a flying handshake what it is! Where's my bomber?

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ 
Let's just climb upstairs to my office and discuss this like two 
reasonable... 

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Your private life's your own concern, pal.  Where the hell is my 
bomber?  Look at this place...where's your pride?  It's like a pigsty 
down here!

	374
THE TELESCOPING ARM of John Bigbooté suddenly shooting out and lifting 
the Secretary off the floor, banging him into the wall...

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It's not my goddamn planet!  Understand, monkey boy!? 

...BIZARRE LAMPS SWAYING as GUNFIRE upstairs prompts Bigbooté to 
release the Secretary, to urge O'Connor to head for a door off the 
hallway...

JOHN O'CONNOR
But John Whorfin said kill her. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Damn John Whorfin--! 

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT	375

Bigbooté and O'Connor emerging in the hallway...seen by Buckaroo Banzai 
and New Jersey as RED ARACHTOIDS...

JOHN PARKER
Look out, Buckaroo Banzai!

Buckaroo turning and just in time, the alien JOHN GOMEZ right behind 
him...and behind Gomez, John Parker and Perfect Tommy with flame 
throwers...

...Buckaroo and New Jersey hitting the deck as the RED ARACHTOID gets 
smoked, the aliens John Bigbooté and John O'Connor escaping in the 
confusion...

INT.  THE PIT - NIGHT	376

The Secretary of Defense still on the floor, spotting the OVERTHRUSTER 
in Penny's purse, taking it just as Buckaroo and New Jersey rush into 
the room...lights swaying...shadows dancing...

...the Secretary struggling to his feet as Buckaroo cuts Penny 
down...spraying her with a white insecticide, New Jersey checking her 
vital signs, Buckaroo shocking New Jersey accidentally with a jolt of 
STATIC ELECTRICITY, as the Secretary slips the OVERTHRUSTER under his 
coat...

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
(to no one in particular)
It's not over yet...I'll bounce back...always have.  I'll come through 
this thing smelling like a goddamn rose-just watch me.

The Secretary limping out of the room...New Jersey trying to get 
penny's pulse while Buckaroo peels back her eyelids...

NEW JERSEY
Leave her to me. You take care of business. 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Thanks.

Buckaroo looking at New Jersey, knowing he can trust him, rummaging 
through Penny's purse...no Overthruster...

INT.  YOYODYNE SHOCK TOWER - NIGHT	377

Dr. Lizardo and the alien John O'Connor and the alien John Bigbooté 
seeing their deteriorating position OVER A CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV...VIDEO 
IMAGES OF THE INVADING FORCES...

Sound the call to board ship!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
Without the crucial missing circuit?  We'll never make it! 

JOHN O'CONNOR
They are only monkey boys!  We can still crush them here--! 

Lizardo picking up a primitive INCOMPLETE OVERTHRUSTER THE SIZE OF AN 
APPLE CRATE...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
You heard my orders!  Activate the Special Horns!

INT.  FLOODED CORRIDOR - NIGHT	378

Coming through!  Clear it!

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	380

...the light of a new day starting to glow through grimy windows...as 
down on the floor, Dr. Lizardo is about to scale a spindly ladder into 
his BIG SUSPENDED SPACESHIP...Lizardo spotting Buckaroo, John Parker 
and Hong Kong Cavaliers entering this sacred space...

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Massacre them! Without quarter! 

Dr. Lizardo pushing his own soldiers aside, scurrying into his 
SPACESHIP with John Bigbooté and John O'CONNOR.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	381

no sooner inside than a cowardly order is issued to John O'Connor:

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Close the doors! 

INT.  LAUNCH HANGAR - DAWN	382

Meanwhile, the floor of the hangar...the alien John Parker using 
strange judo, the amazing Blue Shields fighting like Samurai, ducking 
STINGERS, FIREING into the enemy at point blank range...

BUCKAROO SEEING Dr. Lizardo's engine start up, CLOUDS OF BLACK SMOKE 
pouring from the exhaust pipes...

WHILE OVER YONDER the Secretary of Defense spots the JET CAR unattended 
amid that field of weird yellow totems...

ANOTHER ANGLE	386

John Parker reaching the BIG SPACESHIP to find Buckaroo already there, 
Buckaroo taking the lead up a tall ladder that seems to reach to a REAR 
ENTRANCE.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	387

Buckaroo settling into a weird little chair, John Parker at his side, 
facing the opposite direction in a love-seat arrangement...at a wall 
cluttered with confusing instruments and a framed photo of LIZARDO...NO 
WAY INTO THE BIG SHIP FROM HERE...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
What is this thing?  A fighter?

JOHN PARKER
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	388

John Bigbooté in the co-pilot's seat, as Doctor Lizardo attempts to 
connect his clumsy overthruster.

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Overthruster in place. 

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
It won't work! It won't! 

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Shut up, John Bigboote, you coward! 

John O'Connor pushing John Bigbooté aside as Lizardo hits another 
switch and for a fraction of a second ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE, A BLINDING 
GREEN LIGHT!

DOCTOR LIZARDO
Almost!  Almost!  Lower my vehicle onto the runway!

JOHN BIGBOOTÉ
No!  Please!

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	395

THE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT, TRAPPING THEM...

Meanwhile, unnoticed, Secretary of Defense John McKinley reaches the 
JET CAR, starts to climb in...

SMALL VOICE
Another step, I'll drink your blood--!

The Secretary turning, not seeing anyone at first...then little Scooter 
Lindley with an M-14 trained on him...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Get 'em up!

Scooter means business...as he suddenly demonstrates, blowing away an 
oncoming ARACHTOID before turning the gun back on the Secretary, who 
raises his hands...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
What's that?

SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Can opener...just a...

Scooter taking the CURIOUS OBJECT from his prisoner, not fooled for a

The sudden "expulsion" by the wall of a TWEEDY, FLESHY OBJECT 
RESEMBLING A LUMP OF CLAY which rapidly begins to define itself as the

bewilderment, SEVERAL 15th CENTURY BUCCANEERS spit out next, equally 
disoriented...

INT.  LIZARDO'S BIG SPACESHIP - DAWN	402

The "other Lizardo" (Whorfin) meanwhile undergoing a painful reverse 
transformation: FROM OLD MAN BACK TO RED ARACHTOID!  HIS EYES 
GLOWING...LIGHT ENERGY GLOWING INSIDE HIS MOUTH!

Full speed ahead!

JOHN BIGTOOTE
We haven't a chance.  Your Overthruster's for shit!  We'll all just...

I have my order from John Emdall!  8000 miles.  Mark.  Activate 
particle beam.  Lock on Smolensk.

INT.  THERMOPOD - DAWN	410

John Parker fiddling with a RADIO, homing in on the black ship's

Particle beam activated...lock on Smolensk...one minute to rapid 
rupture...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell them to stop.  They're your friends!

JOHN PARKER
I lack the authority, Buckaroo Banzai.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
At least tell them I'm trying!  Tell 'em something--!

John Parker talking to the father ship as Buckaroo struggles to unlock 
the strange little saucer from Whorfin's big vehicle.

Sir, a thermopod has peeled off from Whorfin's ship!

BLACK ARACHTOID COMMANDER
So what?  Big deal.  Stand by to incinerate Smolensk.

Buckaroo struggling to master the strange craft...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?

Boy, I hope so, Buckaroo Banzai.

earth.

CLOSER SHOT: Buckaroo!  Safe and sound, looking up and SALUTING John 
Parker as the little THERMOPOD flip-flops, tumbles heavenward AT AN 
INCREDIBLE RATE OF SPEED...heading home.

Buckaroo touching down...Professor Hikita among the victorious Blue

Now it's the young Doctor Lizardo's turn to stare incredulously...

DOCTOR LIZARDO

RENO FINDING A CUTLASS ON THE GROUND...as Buckaroo, face blackened with 
soot, his clothing torn, hurries toward several Blue Shields (gas masks 
off) herding a half-dozen "HUMAN" PRISONERS while other Shields and 
Cavaliers share congratulatory handshakes...RED STINGERS still stuck in 
their bullet-proof vests...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
All accounted for?  Where's Penny?

PERFECT TOMMY
New Jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  Quite a guy 
if you want my opinion.

Perfect Tommy and Reno pacing Buckaroo...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Got a casualty list?

RENO
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're 
illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could 
throw the book at 'em...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back 
to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't 
in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and 
inside out...

Perfect Tommy whistling...

PERFECT TOMMY
Hey, Scooter Lindley, fall in!

Scooter's eyes lighting up as he runs over...

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Is this what you're looking for, Buckaroo?

The Oscillation Overthruster, safe and sound.  Buckaroo amazed, 
receiving the precious object, giving Scooter a Blue Shield 
salute...the Secretary of Defense watching jealously from a short 
distance, his clothing disheveled...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Looks like one Junior Shield is in line for a ride in The Jet Car.

SCOOTER LINDLEY
Wow, you know it!
(suddenly crestfallen)
I'll have to ask my dad.

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Well, go ahead, what're you waiting for?

Scooter running off.

	434
A dour-faced, shaken New Jersey appears in the doorway of the big bus, 
Buckaroo's smile immediately vanishing...

NEW JERSEY
I did all I could.  I did my best...

Buckaroo racing past new Jersey and into the bus...

INT.  PASSENGER SECTION/BUT - DAWN	435

Buckaroo hurrying through the front section.

INT.  WORLD WATCH ONE/BUS - DAWN	436

Buckaroo hurrying through the COMMUNICATIONS NERVE CENTER...

RADAR SHIELD ONE
Buckaroo, Reno said check with you - something about "pirates"?  He 
mean the baseball team?

No response.

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Buckaroo, the President's on line on.  Calling about is everything okay 
with the alien space cloud and Planet Ten...or should he just go ahead 
and destroy Russia...? 

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Tell him yes on "1" and no on "2". 

Buckaroo going into his PRIVATE REAR SECTION of the bus...

RADAR SHIELD TWO
Which was "yes"? Destroy Russia? Or "2"...?

INT. BEDROOM/BUS - DAWN	437

Buckaroo reaching his private quarters, finding Penny on his cot, a 
sheet pulled over her face...ethereal morning light caressing her still 
body...

...Buckaroo distraught, pulling the sheet back to reveal Penny in final 
repose, speckled with dead ants, honey and powdery white insecticide... 
Buckaroo leaning toward her in wordless anguish.

	438
His lips moving toward hers...when suddenly a SPARK LEAPS OUT, ARCING 
FROM THE TIP OF BUCKAROO'S NOSE TO THE TIP OF PENNY'S!

	439
And she stirs...a faint nerve response, Buckaroo seizing her with both 
hands...SPARKS...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Penny!

...shaking her, exhorting her...

BUCKAROO BANZAI
Open your eyes!  Look at me!  Penny!

...but nothing, no more signs of life...

	440
...Buckaroo kissing her in despair, pressing his lips against her 
lips...the kiss of the century, A POWERFUL ELECTRIC JOLT!

	441
...the fire of life as Penny opens her eyes, sees her haggard hero 
before her.

PENNY PRIDDY
Buckaroo...you look awful.

	442
And indeed they both do, but who cares?  ANOTHER GALVANIC KISS, 
CRACKLING GOOD as the tiny bedroom heats up and we do the decent 
thing...IRIS OUT...as CREDITS ROLL and the FANTASTIC VOICE OF Dr. 
Buckaroo Banzai serenades us home...

...the Hong Kong Cavaliers harmonizing like honey, the world once again 
a safe, snug harbor.

                       FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT
                           December 21, 2001

     FADE IN:
1    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                    1
     As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American
     high school...
1A   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                1A
     ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the
     unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music.
1B   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY                1B
     The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light
     from an open door...
                          MATT (O.S.)
                This is unwatchable. It's not even in
                focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is
                in the shot. This is really shoddy work.
1C   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY                1C
     The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a
     TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face.
                          DEACON (O.S.)
                Why do they always show the guy's face?
                It's like, can't we just assume he's
                enjoying it?
     We slowly PULL BACK from the TV.
                          FRED (O.S.)
                Because they're trying to make us feel
                like we're better looking than that guy,
                so we should be able to get chicks as hot
                as her.
                          DEACON (O.S.)
                How the hell do you know?
                          FRED (O.S.)
                It's a basic rule of porno.
     Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON.
     They're watching the porno...
2    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                   2
     ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can
     still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their
     book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.

    FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        2.



                        DEACON (V.O.)
              It all started on my seventeenth birthday
              with our usual morning routine: film
              appreciation.
    The school bell RINGS and Deacon clicks off the TV.
                        FRED
              Deacon! What are you doing? I was
              watching that.
                        DEACON
              Come on, let's go. We're going to be
              late.
                        DEACON (V.O.) (CONT'D)
              And when I say film appreciation, I mean
              film duplication. Fred steals them, Matt
              copies them, and I sell them.
    Matt walks over to the TV and presses eject on five VCR's.
    The original plus four copies pop out.
    CLOSE ON the original tape: "Ramalot Productions presents
    Dirty Darla #7," as Matt hands it to Fred and the copies to
    Deacon. They smile.
3   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY                   3
    The guys are waiting in line for lunch.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Fred's the kind of kid who's basically
              given up on high school. He figures his
              glory days are way ahead of him.
                        FRED
              First, I go to Yale, then Harvard law,
              then when I'm making a hundred grand a
              year, I'll have a whole stable of hot
              chicks sitting around topless on my
              yacht.
    He smiles ears to ear, looking for approval.
                        MATT
                  (to Deacon)
              Will that work?
                        DEACON
                  (to Fred)
              You are a complete moron.
    Deacon and Matt walk off. Fred calls after them.
                        FRED
              What?

    FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        3.



4   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     4
    The video monitors up and down the hallways display an image
    that reads "Fifteen Days Till Midterms."
    Fred sees two AMAZING GIRLS walking towards him.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Until that big payday, Fred's sex life
              consists of spanking it.
                        AMAZING GIRL
              That test was sooo hard.
    That's too much for Fred to take. He adjusts his pants, turns
    ninety degrees, and makes a beeline for:
5   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         5
    Fred looks under the stalls to make sure no one's in there,
    then enters a stall and locks the door.
    He puts his book bag down, then places a protector on the
    toilet seat and sits down. He pulls a large wad of toilet
    paper off the roll. Then, from out of the book bag, Fred
    pulls a bottle of Moisty-Mate hand lotion. He smiles.
6   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     6
    Fred is walking to class when he spots a HOT GIRL, rubbing a
    stain off of her shirt. Another HOT GIRL grabs her arm.
                        HOT GIRL
              We're going to be late. Are you coming?
    Fred perks up.
7   INT. BOYS' BATHROOM - DAY                                         7
    Fred walks into the stall and grabs the toilet protector.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Fred averages two to five time a day,
              depending on how many girls he sees in
              the hallway.
8   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                     8
    Matt is videotaping the students (including J.T. and Mark)
    running down the hallway to class. Fred watches.
                        DEACON (V.O.)
              Now Matt-- Matt's what you'd call a late
              bloomer. Secretary of the Audio Visual
              Club, amateur filmmaker, and complete
              dork.

      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        4.



      J.T. and Mark grab Matt's camera and film each other flipping
      him off. Matt grabs it back and the Twins walk away laughing.
      Fred shakes his head.
                             FRED
                   What are you doing?
                             MATT
                   All great directors start this way. I'm
                   documenting the essence of high school.
                   Teenagers running to meet their destiny
                   only to find it's just home room. It's
                   very existential.
                             FRED
                   So's my balls. See you later.

9     OMITTED                                                             9
10    INT. OUTSIDE THE LOCKER ROOMS - DAY                                10
      Matt trudges into the locker room area, holding a towel to
      his bloody nose.
                             DEACON (V.O.)
                   In the normal course of things, Matt
                   probably wouldn't even have been our
                   friend, but Fred likes having someone to
                   boss around, and I think Matt's actually
                   pretty cool once you get to know him.
      Just then, the burly GIRLS' SWIM TEAM COACH comes out of the
      girls' locker room. She walks by Matt without noticing, and
      the door to the locker room closes slowly.
      Matt's attention is drawn to it. The door stops with a CREAK,
      a sliver of daylight still visible.
      Matt shakes his head and starts to walk away towards the
      boys' locker room. Then, he stops. He's torn. He's still too
      immature to really be interested, but he thinks he should be.
      He looks around quickly, then slowly approaches the door. He
      turns his head sideways, and places it up against the crack.
10A   MATT'S POV                                                        10A
      The proverbial jackpot. Teenage girls changing. Bras.
      Panties. Towels...
10B   REVERSE ANGLE                                                     10B
      Matt's eyes widen. And then, they CLOSE TIGHT. He quickly
      scurries away.
                             DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.)
                   Well, at least he's got the key to the
                   A/V room.

     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     5.



11   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   11
     Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN.
                         DEACON
               Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This
               is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot
               more than twenty dollars.
                         DORKY FRESHMAN
               Sweet.
     He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the
     tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away.
     Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees
     a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping.
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               People always talk about how tough it is
               being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have
               to watch one more TV movie about bulimia
               or self mutilation or vaginal dryness...
     Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some
     CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some
     books for class.
                         DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a
               seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's
               like to have only one thing on your mind
               all day, every day, but to have
               absolutely no way of getting it.
12   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                        12
     CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina.
     PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but
     really staring at...
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               Testosterone is a drug more powerful than
               heroin. I don't really have any evidence
               to support that, but the point is, a
               horny teenage boy will do almost anything
               for even a glimpse of sex.
     ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her
     conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing
     headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even
     if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that
     doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.

     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     6.



                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
                   (in the background)
               ... the increase in the hormone
               testosterone causes certain physiological
               changes in the adolescent male...
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               We're suffering. Suffering from a deep,
               debilitating addiction to something we've
               never even had. Teenage boys are like
               time bombs, ready to explode.
     BEHIND DEACON
     Two GUYS are whispering.
                         GUY 1
               Did you hear about Rachael?
                         GUY 2
               No, what happened?
                         GUY 1
               John Baldwin nailed her.
     Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned.
                         DEACON
               Are you talking about Rachael Unger?
                         GUY 1
               Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's
               party. In the bathroom.
                         DEACON
                   (crushed)
               You're kidding.
13   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)                        13
     RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked
     under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS
     from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state
     of undress.
                         DEACON
               Rachael! What are you doing?
     She sits up and strikes a sexy pose.
                         RACHAEL
               We've been together for a year now, and I
               thought it was time to take our
               relationship to the next level.
     Deacon is becoming very nervous.

     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                      7.



                         DEACON
               Now?
                         RACHAEL
               You've been talking about this for
               months.
                         DEACON
               I didn't think you were listening to me.
     Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious.
                         RACHAEL
               Don't you want to?
                         DEACON
               Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't
               have anything...
     She pulls out a condom.
                         RACHAEL
               I do.
     But he's still hesitating.
                         RACHAEL (CONT'D)
               Deacon, what's the problem?
     Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
     taking. An eternity passes. Then,
                         DEACON
               I have a math test tomorrow.
14   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY (END FLASHBACK)                        14
     The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He
     turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to
     describe the John Baldwin incident.
                         DEACON (V.O.)

     Deacon is suddenly...

     ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is
     nothing compared to how he feels when he looks

     DOWN THE HALLWAY
     and sees Rachael at her locker, hugging some people good-bye
     (including a good-looking guy who must be JOHN BALDWIN).
     Rachael looks down the hallway towards Deacon, but Deacon
     ducks away.
     Now he's even more embittered.
16   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY              16
     Fred and Matt are walking towards their bikes after school.
                         FRED
               Did you videotape it?
                         MATT
                   (sarcastically)
               Yeah. I took my camera to gym class with
               me.
                         FRED
               You are the biggest moron I have ever
               known.
     Just then, Deacon comes up to them.
                         DEACON
               Hey, guys. Here's the money.
     He hands out the proceeds from the operation, and Matt
     notices that Deacon is a little out of sorts.
                         MATT
               Something wrong?
     Deacon lets out a deep breath.
                         DEACON
               Yeah. I heard Rachael Unger did it with
               John Baldwin.
                         FRED
               Well, you had your chance. I told you to
               seal that deal.
                          DEACON
               Shut up, Fabio. I don't see you sealing
               any deals.
                         FRED
               I'm biding my time.
                         DEACON
               Whatever. It just wasn't good timing.

          It doesn't get any better than that. You
          and Rachael were perfect for each other.
          And naked girls don't just appear out of
          thin air.

          Look, I've been thinking about this all

                    MATT
          So?
They reach the bike rack and start unlocking their bikes.
                    DEACON
          So we have a responsibility to ourselves
          to start having fun and getting girls.
          This year is our year.
              (takes the chain off his bike)
          There's nothing holding us back any more.
Over in the parking lot, JAKE, a studly senior, revs the
engine on his truck. Two hot girls, KELLY and WENDY, sit on
his bumper, chatting.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          You see? That's exactly what I'm talking
          about. That could be us.
                    FRED
          That's not going to be us this year, or
          next year, or any year, ever.
                    DEACON
          Why not? All we have to do is follow the
          simple lessons of Tony Montana in "Scar
          Face."
                    MATT
          Ooh. Good movie.

                 my new car tonight for my birthday, we'll
                 have the power to go wherever we want.
                 Then, there's nothing stopping us from
                 getting the girls.
     Fred and Matt look at Deacon warily. Is this a plan? Then,
     the hot girls and Jake drive past the guys.
                           JAKE
                 Bye, Sphincter!
     They laugh, then peel out with the radio blasting.
                           FRED
                 Nothing's going to change, Deacon. You're
                 still going to be the kid who shit his
                 pants in fifth grade and no one will ever
                 let you forget it.

                 I had a stomach virus, asshole.
     Just then, a super hot CHEERLEADER drops her car keys and
     bends over to pick them up.

     Fred adjusts himself.

     Fred arrives dressed for work (name tag, shirt, etc.) and
     waves to RUSS, the scraggly owner of this small video rental
     store.
     Fred passes J.T., Mark, Wendy, and Kelly and a bunch of other
     CUSTOMERS on his way to the back section of the store.
     ADULT SECTION
     Fred makes sure Russ isn't looking and ducks into the porno
     section. Hurriedly, he pulls out "Half-Cyborg 5: Final
     Showdown" from his book bag. But inside the case is the tape
     for "Dirty Darla #7." He makes the switch. Fred sighs a
     breath of relief, smiles, and walks out of the adult
     section...

Fred SCREAMS.
                    RUSS (CONT'D)
          I've been watching you.
Russ grabs Fred by the shoulders and throws him up against
the shelf, shaking him with every word.

          Those movies aren't for little monkey-

The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free,
and Russ chases after him.
                    RUSS
          Come back here, you bastard!
Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him
and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred
is still SCREAMING.
Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A
crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle.
                    RUSS (CONT'D)
          What else you got in here?
Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for
more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an
iron grip and keeps him away.
Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex
tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming
Lotion, Q-tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves...
Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out.

               Great. Now after the right, I want you to
               parallel park in the open space.
     Deacon complies.
                         DEACON
               I begin the parallel parking maneuver by
               pulling within three feet of the forward
               vehicle. I now shift into reverse while

                          DEACON
                Coop. It's my birthday today, so cut me
                some slack, all right?
      Coop looks him over, then opens the door.
                          COOP
                    (ad lib)
                Well, pickle my turnips, why didn't you
                say so? Happy birthday, friend.
      The guys look at each other, excited. They look back at
      Roger, five feet behind them at the bottom of the steps.
                          ROGER
                Little help?

      People drinking, dancing, couples making out. Girls
      everywhere. And over near the keg is...

                    DEACON
              (in a trance)
          Oh, my God. There's Naomi.
                    FRED
          She looks good.
And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot
party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps
her...
CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the
world goes still .
She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin
with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair
floats in the air.
DEACON AND FRED
are zombies, completely mesmerized by her.
                    FRED
          She spilled her beer.
                    DEACON
          Yeah.
Fred adjusts his pants. Deacon makes a decision. One that
he'd normally never make.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got
          to lose?
                    FRED
          Your dignity?
                    DEACON
          She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I
          don't know her.
                    MATT
          Ask her if she has any unusual hats.
          Girls like that.
Deacon gives Matt a dirty look.

                    DEACON
          Hey, Naomi.
                    NAOMI
          Happy Birthday, Deacon.

                    DEACON
              (pleasantly surprised)
          You remembered.
                    NAOMI
          Well, I got this flyer and--
                    DEACON
          Oh, right. So where's Jake?
                    NAOMI
          Like I care.
                    DEACON
              (hopeful)
          So you two aren't going out any more?
                      NAOMI
          Duh.
Deacon's mind is racing with possibilities when:
                      JAKE (O.S.)
          Freakin!
It's Jake, back for another beer.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger?
Before Deacon can answer...
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          He shoots, he misses, right, ass-
          sphincter? Come on, Naomi. We're going in
          the pool.
                    NAOMI
          Screw off. I'm talking to Deacon.
                      JAKE
          Whatever.
                      NAOMI
          Whatever.
Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a "let's go" to J.T. and
Mark, and heads out back.
                    NAOMI (CONT'D)
          What an asshole.
As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi,
but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened
here?
REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background.

28   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER                              28
     Deacon wanders out back. It's   very dark and there are several
     people in the pool, including   Jake's good-looking friends,
     Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK.   It's hard to tell in the dark
     water, but it looks like they   might not be wearing any
     clothes. Deacon sees this and   starts to walk away.
                         J.T.
               Deacon. I heard it was your birthday.
               Come on in the pool, man.
                         DEACON
               No, that's okay.
                         MARK
               No, seriously. It's cool.
                         KELLY
                   (come hither)
               Come on, Deacon.
                         WENDY
               Yeah. Come on.
     Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge.
                            DEACON
               All right.
     He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over
     to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on.
                         MARK
               Dude, what are you doing? Take off your
               clothes.
                            DEACON
               What?
                         WENDY
               We're skinny dipping, Deacon.
     He hesitates, not sure what to do.
                         DEACON
               Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys
               alone then--
                         KELLY
               --No, come on in. Join us.
     Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the
     water and you can just make out the top of her breast.

DEACON
looks at her, thinks it over, and finally... slips off his
shorts. He gets into the pool in his underwear, then slips
them off, too, and throws them on the side of pool.
                    DEACON
          Wow. This feels amazing.
Someone splashes Kelly, she giggles, and the other kids swim
around. Kelly swims by Deacon seductively and he smiles.
                    JAKE (O.S.)
          Coop's doing funnels. Come on.
It's Jake, by the side of the pool with Deacon's clothes. The
other people swim to the front, and get out of the pool...
...wearing clothes! Even Wendy, in a strapless bra.
                    J.T.
              (rubbing it in)
          Sorry, dude.
                    DEACON
          Hey, give me back my clothes!
                    JAKE
          Freakin? I can't see you. Maybe I need to
          turn on the LIGHTS.
And he does. The backyard lights go on illuminating the
scene. Deacon panics. People start looking at him, laughing.
Then, the cheesy colored pool lights come on, flashing
slowly.
Deacon is humiliated. Jake bends down to whisper to Deacon.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Did you really think Naomi was into you?
Deacon doesn't respond. But it's not enough for Jake. He
picks up Deacon's underwear with a stick and examines them.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God! Skid marks. Aaaahhh, Deacon
          shit his pants again!
                    DEACON
          No, I didn't! Give them back!
Jake does a victory lap around the pool with Deacon's
underwear on the stick. Everybody is laughing.
                    JAKE
          Sphincter boy shit his pants!

28A   INT. COOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)                             28A
      Jake locks the sliding glass door and waves at Deacon in the
      pool. The group laughs and walks away.
29    EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER                               29
      Deacon is still in the pool, shivering and shrivelled.
      Finally, the lights turn off in the back yard, and Deacon
      ventures out of the pool.
      He grabs an inflatable elephant pool toy and slips it around
      his privates. He slowly sneaks around the house.
29A   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - SIDE OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)         29A
      A dog BARKS! He snarls at Deacon standing there wearing only
      the pool toy. Deacon runs away into the
29B   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)                  29B
      The Dog is right behind him. Deacon struggles with him.
                          DEACON
                Hey, watch the nads!
      But it's no use. The dog BITES the front of the pool toy and
      it starts to deflate...
      ... just as the HEADLIGHTS of a car pull into the driveway.
      Deacon FREEZES. He desperately tries to cover himself with
      the rapidly diminishing toy being jerked away by the dog in a
      motion that makes it look like Deacon's getting a doggie
      hummer. A MAN gets out of the car.

      The next day, the guys are at the bike rack, when a hot
      SPORTS CAR drives by. Deacon is visibly bummed.
                          DEACON
                You know how long it's going to take to
                save up for a car selling porno tapes
                twenty bucks a pop?
      Fred looks down.
                          DEACON (CONT'D)
                What?
                          FRED
                There's a small problem.

               What?
                         FRED
               I got fired yesterday. Russ caught me and
               went berserk. Some sort of sting
               operation he's been planning for months.
               I don't know.
                         DEACON
               You're kidding me, right? Tell me you're
               kidding.
                         FRED
               No. And now I have to work twice a week
               at my dad's office. I told you this
               Scarface plan was stupid.
                         DEACON
               Great. So now we've got no girls, no car,
               and no money.
                         FRED
               And no porn.
                         MATT
               Tony Montana would be very disappointed.
     Deacon is once again...
31   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                           31
     ... very depressed, as he sits, bored out of his mind in his
     biology class.
                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
               Now turn your textbooks to chapter six,
               the Animal Kingdom. As you should know by
               now, biology is the study of life, in all
               its infinite varieties.
     Deacon continues to stare at her perpetually hard nipples.
                         BIOLOGY TEACHER (CONT'D)
               So to keep things a little fun around

                    DORKY FRESHMAN
          Is this some kind of extortion racket?
          I'll pay you double if you can get me
          something today.
                    DEACON
          I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for
          a while. We don't have anything new.
                    DORKY FRESHMAN
          I'm dying. I just need something.
Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot.
                    DEACON
          Hey, Naomi. What are you up to?
                    NAOMI
          Going home to cram for midterms.
With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork.
                    DEACON
          Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you
          needed any help.
                    NAOMI
          That's okay. I'll be all right.
Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate
not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack
by asking,
                    NAOMI (CONT'D)
          So where did Rachael go off to?
                    DEACON
          She went to Paris with the French Club.
              (then, taking a chance)
          We're seeing other people.
She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's
laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the
difference. He relaxes...
                    JAKE (O.S.)
          Hey, sphincter.
... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to
really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi.
                    DEACON
          Look, can you please stop calling me
          that? I think we're old enough to just
          let it go. All right?

               Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants.
     He looks at Naomi.
                            JAKE (CONT'D)
               Hi, Naomi.
                            NAOMI
               Whatever.
     She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the
     engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way,
     but his bike is CRUSHED by the car.
                         JAKE
               Oops. Sorry.
     He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as
     he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks
     away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is...

                   (emphatic)
               Look, mom. I need a car.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               But I thought we agreed--
                         DEACON
               I need a car of my own.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Well, honey. A car is a lot of
               responsibility.
                         DEACON
               Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I
               can handle it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell
               you what. Maybe you can get an after
               school job to earn money for a car. I'll
               talk to your father.
     Deacon is stewing.

               And these monkeys are doing it. I mean,
               they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is
               videotaping it.

                         BIOLOGY TEACHER
                   (getting hot and bothered)
               With one final thrust of his engorged
               penis, the male deposits his seed and
               moves on.
                   (suddenly bitter)
               Probably to a younger, more desirable
               female. One who doesn't have any
               "issues." Whatever that means.
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               That's when it hit me.
     Just then, a glob of "something" shoots out towards the crowd
     (SFX). Everyone ducks, except for Roger, who's can't move
     quickly enough in his wheelchair. It hits him in the face,
     dripping down his orthodontia.
                         ROGER
               A little help!
                         DEACON (V.O.)
               Well, Roger actually...

               What?
                         DEACON
               Let's make one.
                           MATT
               One what?
                           DEACON
               A movie.
                         MATT
               Great! That's perfect! I've already got
               an idea for a kind of sci-fi horror
               thing. It's like "The Shining" meets "The
               Jetsons."
                         DEACON
               No, you moron. A porno film.
     Fred lights up.
                         FRED
               Even better.
                         DEACON
               And check this out. The best part of all,
               is I've got an angle.

                    FRED
          What kind of angle?
                    DEACON
          We can make pornos that cater to guys
          like us.
                    FRED
          You mean virgins.
                    DEACON
          Yes. Adult films made by virgins for
          virgins.
                    MATT
          With good cinematography.
                    FRED
          And cute, nice girls. The kind you'd want
          to take to dinner with your parents.
                    DEACON
          Right. No shots of sweaty guys' faces.
                    FRED
          And nothing up the butt.
They look at him.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          What? I don't like it when they put stuff
          up their butt.
                    MATT
          These have to be nicely edited. We should
          shoot on super 16 and transfer to video.
                     DEACON
          No, Matt. We'll shoot it on your video
          camera. We're not getting any expensive
          equipment.
                    FRED
          How are we going to get the women to star
          in the film?
                    MATT
          And the guys.
                    DEACON
          I don't know. We'll surf the net. We'll
          figure it out.
They look at each other for a beat. Finally, Fred and Matt
crack up.

          What?
                    FRED
          That was really funny.
Deacon just looks at them, pissed.
                    DEACON
          I'm serious about this.
                    MATT
          We can't make a porno movie.
                    FRED
          Do you have any idea how much trouble
          we'd get in?
                    DEACON
          Do you have any idea how much money we'd
          make?
A beat.
                    MATT
          Like how much?
                    DEACON
          Enough for a car. Enough for more camera
          shit. To take girls out. I don't know.
          For whatever we want.
Beat. Beat. Beat. They're thinking about it.
                    FRED
          What about the moral implications?
                    DEACON
          It's a free market transaction between
          consenting adults. What's the problem?
                    FRED
          We're not adults.
                    MATT
          He's got a point, Deacon.
                    DEACON
          Guys, tell me the truth. Haven't you ever
          wondered... haven't you ever imagined
          what it would be like to make one?
                    MATT
          Not really.
Deacon turns to Fred, who looks guilty.

                         FRED
               Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've
               thought about shaving Principal Taggert's
               ass, too.
     A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal.
                         DEACON
               Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't
               let slip away. If we make this movie, it
               could be the best year of our lives.
               We'll go in boys and come out men. And at
               the end, we'll have the money, the power,
               and the women. But you losers would
               rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going
               to waste another minute. I'm making this
               porno movie with or without you. And when
               I show up at school in my new set of
               wheels, and you two limp dicks are
               begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll
               just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That
               ship has sailed. You blew it."
     Ringing silence.
                         MATT
                   (sincerely)
               That was a really good speech, Deacon.
                           DEACON
               Thanks.
                         MATT
               Did you work that out before?
                           DEACON
               No, Matt.
                         FRED
               Okay... So say we were to do this. What
               would we call our company?
                         MATT
               I've got it. "After School Special."

39   INT. VIC'S "STUDIO" - CONTINUOUS                                39
     A small, vertically integrated porno production company.
     Blow-ups of the company's box covers on the walls, hundreds
     of copies of titles on shelves, a small STAFF and two
     adjoining rooms.
     VIC RAMALOT, whose face we recognize from Dirty Darla #7,
     enters from the set. His partner, MIKE, helps him on with his
     robe.
                         MIKE
               That was good. Some good action.
                         VIC
               I've got a question for you Mike, and I
               want you to promise to be completely
               honest.
                         MIKE
               Sure. Of course, Vic.
     Vic looks at him, vulnerable.
                         VIC
               Do you think I'm too fat?
                         MIKE
               Are you kidding? The camera loves you.
                            VIC
               Seriously?
                         MIKE
               Absolutely.
                         VIC
               Thanks, man.
     Vic gives Mike a jive hand shake and the two do a little hug.
     Over Mike's shoulder, Vic sees the woman who's come into the

     where there's a terribly FRIGHTENED MAN (cameo for Ron
     Jeremy, etc.) tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth.
     Vic shakes his head, picking up a pair of rusty hedge
     clippers from the table. He snaps them open.
                         VIC
               So, you think you can just walk into my
               town and move in on my territory?
     The Man takes a quick look down at his own crotch, fearing
     the worst. He shakes his head, pleading through his gag.

               That's it? Does that include the sex?

                         MATT
               So how do we get women for this movie?
                         FRED
               We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press
               for "body models." That's like some sort
               of code word in the industry.

               Are we supposed to have sex with these

Fred puts the samples down. She rolls her eyes then leaves.

          We also need an adult signature to set up
          the bank account and the web site.

          Let's use Principal Taggert's name.

          Oh yeah, good idea. That'll never come
          back to haunt us.
                    DEACON
          Then whose name should we use?
Just then, MR. GREITZER comes into the office.
                    GREITZER
          I'm Ronald Greitzer here for my 4:00
          appointment.
                    RECEPTIONIST

He leaves and Fred looks at Deacon, mischievously.

          No way.
                    FRED
          Why not? It's perfect. My dad's got Mr.
          Greitzer's signature on file, his credit
          card number, and his social security
          number...

          And he'll never find out?

          It's not like we're going to send him our
          annual report. It'll just be like an
          official name of record or something.

          Okay. Cool.

                And we need porno names.
                          DEACON
                What do you mean?
                          FRED
                It's a basic rule of porno. All people
                affiliated with the production of an
                adult film have porno names so their
                friends don't recognize them.

                Oh, you mean like "Johnny Hardmember"?
                          FRED
                Exactly. That's a good one. I'll be Balls

                Guys. Those kind of names are just for
                the actors.
                          MATT
                You're just jealous that you don't have a
                cool porno name like us.
                          DEACON
                Okay, fine. Then I'm Sam ...

                That name sucks.
                          FRED
                You don't get it, do you? A porno name
                needs to be a very subtle thing.
      Fred gestures and DROPS the samples which SPLATTER all over
      the ground.

               "We've been using ND-90 for twenty-two
               years." But Johnson's an idiot. He
               doesn't know ND-90 doesn't even exist
               anymore.
     Mom yawns. The phone rings and she gets it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Hello?
                   (covers phone)
               Deacon, it's for you. It's a young lady
               named Palomina.
     Deacon CHOKES on his food. He gets up quickly and grabs the
     phone. Max is eyeballing him, so Deacon walks with the phone
     into the other room and talks softly.
                         DEACON
               Yeah. 345 Remson. That's right. Great.
               Wednesday, three to five. Looking forward
               to working with you, too.
     He hangs up and returns to the kitchen to see the whole
     family staring at him, curious.
                         DEACON (CONT'D)
               I'm tutoring someone ... in math. To earn
               money for a car.
     He forces a smile.

               Sure, you can bring your dog.
                   (beat)
               Oh. No, that's okay. Better leave him
               home.

     And there's Matt, wearing a shirt and tie, nervously sitting
     in the rec room with a room full of CRACK WHORES.
     They're a motley crew of fat, old, toothless, spandex-wearing
     streetwalkers (including one TRANSVESTITE).
     An uncomfortable silence pervades the room. Matt turns to one
     woman wearing a rainbow-colored halter top.
                          MATT
               When you have sex with a strange man, do
               you imagine it's like your boyfriend or
               something?
     She just looks at him.
                         DEACON (O.S.)
                   (over a walkie talkie)
               We're ready. Over.
     Matt picks up his walkie talkie.
                         MATT
               Roger. Over.
     He looks at his clipboard and turns to the first woman.
                         MATT (CONT'D)
               You can go in now.
     She gets up and walks through the curtain.

     The basement is set up with a casting couch. Fred and Deacon
     are also dressed in jackets and ties. The Crack Whore makes
     her way over to them. They stare at her, slackjawed.
                         DEACON
               Take a seat please.
                         FRED
               Hi, I'm Balls McLongcock and this is Sam
               Slam.
                         CRACK WHORE
               Tequila. You boys seem kind of young.
                         DEACON
               Don't worry. We're old enough.
                         FRED
               Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any
               films before?
                         CRACK WHORE
               I been in some home movies. Stuff like
               that. Some pictures.
     She tosses a stack of Polaroids at them. The top one has her
     standing next to a horse. Fred is speechless.
                         DEACON
               Okay, then. I think we have what we need.
               We'll call you.
     She's confused.
                         CRACK WHORE
               So you don't want me to suck you two off?
     They look at each other.
                         DEACON
               No, I don't think that will be necessary
               at this time.
                         FRED
               Maybe later.

               Maybe if we put another ad in and say
               we're only looking for good looking
               models.

     They look at him with disdain.
                         FRED
               There's got to be another way to recruit
               porno actresses.

     FLASH!
     Three digital images of the guys are lined up on Deacon's
     computer monitor (thanks Mom and Dad!). Deacon is digitally
     altering the photo of Fred to give him a goatee. Matt's photo
     has already gotten mutton chops and Deacon's looking sweet
     with a fu-manchu.
                         DEACON
               I say we make them from Hawaii.
                          MATT
               Hawaii?
                         DEACON
               It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii
               driver's license looks like?
                          MATT
               No.
                          DEACON
               Exactly.
                         FRED
               But isn't it going to seem a little
               suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland?
                          DEACON
               Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation
               in Hawaii, where do you think people from
               Hawaii go?
     Matt and Fred look at each other. They shrug, then,
                          MATT
               Aloha.

     The next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in
     Hawaiian shirts. Deacon's parents are reading and Max is
     watching TV.
                         DEACON
               Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car?

                But, mom. You said I could use the car,
                but it's never free.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                All right, Deacon. I'll walk to the
                store.
                          MAX
                Where are you guys going?
                            DEACON
                Out.
                          MR. LEWIS
                Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho?
                          FRED
                This is the new style, Mr. Lewis.
                          MAX
                Yeah, for ass-wranglers.

      Inside the car (still in the garage), the three guys apply
      their fake facial hair to match their three new fake i.d.'s.
                          FRED
                Are we really going to do this?
                            DEACON
                Oh, yeah.
      He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on
      the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other
      for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a
      ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure.
                          DEACON (CONT'D)
                    (once again)

The guys step out of the car and see for the first time the
Holy Grail of boyhood fantasies: the neon outline of a
topless woman at the entrance to this upscale strip club.
They stop and stare for a beat, before finally getting up the
nerve to walk up to a menacing BOUNCER sitting on a stool
outside the entrance, reading "The Princess Diaries."
                      BOUNCER
            I.d.'s.
They confidently pull out the i.d.'s and hand them over.

            Richard Runningbear from Hawaii? What
            brings you guys to Cleveland?
              FRED                             MATT
Business.                         Vacation.

                      DEACON
            We're on business, he's on vacation.
He hands the i.d.'s back.
                      BOUNCER
            Well, "tiki-alohi-noa-lohi."
                      DEACON
            Sorry?
                      BOUNCER
            That's Hawaiian for "welcome."
                      FRED
            Right. Of course. We just moved to Hawaii
            a few months ago. Haven't picked up the
            local lingo yet.
They force smiles and wait for the answer...
                      BOUNCER
            Okay. Have a good time, guys.
Deacon grabs the i.d.'s and pushes the other two forward. He
grabs the handle to the door.
                       BOUNCER (CONT'D)
            Oh, and guys.
                (beat)
            Nice lamination job.

               The next two years of high school depend
               on it.

     Then,
                         DEACON
               We've got money.
     Deacon pulls out a wad of cash. The Bouncer looks around,
     then thinks about it for a second.
51   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                51
     WE TRACK the guys as they slowly move down the dark corridor
     towards the light. Each guy is in his own little world, Matt
     and Fred following Deacon as he takes the first nervous
     steps.
     First the neon lights hit them, then the smell of liquor and
     sweat, the sounds of barroom chatter, and finally the
     grinding blast of MUSIC, so powerful it seems to stop them in
     their tracks. Their eyes bug out.
     SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS walking by. As they move further into
     the club, they see actual STRIPPERS soliciting lap dances and
     some TOPLESS DANCERS onstage. Fred smiles ear to ear.
     The guys are locked in a deep primordial trance, broken only
     by the voice of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
                         COCKTAIL WAITRESS
               What'll you boys have? Two drink minimum.

          I'll have a seven and seven.
                      DEACON
          Uh, same.
She leaves.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What's a seven and seven?
                    MATT
          I don't know. But I heard that guy over
          there order one and I like the way it
          sounds. Numerical.
The Waitress comes back with their drinks. He pays her and
then they raise their glasses.

They drink. And CHOKE.

          It tastes like poison.
A beautiful STRIPPER in an American flag bikini approaches.

          Are you boys interested in a dance?
They look at each other.
                      FRED
          Okay?
She takes Fred's hand and walks him over to a private dance
couch. As the next SONG starts, a curtain lowers around Fred
and the Stripper. Fred is a little freaked out.
IN SILHOUETTE
She strips off her top revealing her big American breasts.
She rubs up and down Fred's body, shaking her hair in his
face. Matt and Deacon watch intently.

          Cool.

The song ends, the curtain comes up, and Fred is smiling ear
to ear. The Stripper gets dressed and Fred pays her.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          You want another dance?
                    FRED
          Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to
          go to the bathroom.
He tries to get up, but the Stripper stop him.
                    AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER
          Well how about you buy me a drink?
                      FRED
          Okay.
She sits down on Fred's lap. Right on his boner.

      A beat, then time stands still once more for our heroes as
      ASHLEY makes her entrance. She looks barely legal, dressed in
      a Catholic school girl outfit, and walks up to them.
                          ASHLEY
                Hi, I'm Ashley. You guys are filmmakers?
                          MATT
                Video actually. They won't let me shoot
                on film.
      Deacon pulls out his wad of cash.
                          DEACON
                Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero
                only, no anal, and we're distributing
                through our web site.
                          ASHLEY
                Aren't you kind of young?
                          DEACON
                Aren't you? You know we're going to need
                two forms of i.d. to prove you're over
                eighteen.
                          ASHLEY
                I'm eighteen. Don't worry.
                          FRED
                Then you're hired.
                          MATT
                Shouldn't we audition her first?
                          ASHLEY
                Don't worry. You guys relax and have a
                few drinks. By the time the night's over,
                you'll know I'm your girl.

      one stripper. She whips some ice cream at him. Food fight!

      the Aerostar. She writes down her information on a picture of
      herself. There's a car full of Strippers waiting for her.

      the Strippers and the guys.

      A LADY dressed in sexy clothes and eating chicken wings from
      a huge bucket is waiting around on the set, but Vic is over
      talking to Mike.
                          VIC
                Someone's been recruiting new talent.
                          MIKE
                Jimmy Rimmer says they're from Hawaii.
                          VIC

                come to Cleveland?

                    MIKE
          Vacation? There's the Rock and Roll Hall
          of Fame.
Vic thinks it over.
                    VIC
          That's true.
Vic regains his train of thought.
                    VIC (CONT'D)
          What is this? "F" with Vic month? If any
          more amateurs start moving in on my
          territory, I'm going to get really mad.
Vic opens the drawer and pulls out a GUN. He cocks it
menacingly.
                    MIKE
          Who you gonna shoot?
Vic's bluff has been called. Reluctantly,
                    VIC
          I don't know.
                    MIKE
          Calm down, Vic. I don't need you all
          agitated. You still got five films to
          star in today.
                    VIC
          You're right, Mikey.
Mike takes the gun from Vic and puts it away.
                    MIKE
          Don't worry. I'll find these guys and
          take care of it.
Vic cheers up a bit.
                    VIC
          You hungry?
                    MIKE
          Yeah, I could eat.
                    VIC
          Grab some lunch?
                    MIKE
          Yeah, okay.
The two head out for lunch, leaving the bondage lady sitting
there, confused.

53   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY                                     53
     Deacon wakes up sick as a dog. All the shades are drawn, but
     Fred and Matt are already hard at work on the computer. They
     seem completely fine, with no signs of Deacon's hangover.
                         DEACON
               What are you guys doing?
                         FRED
               We came up with a great idea. We're going
               to presell the videos by posting the
               scripts on the website.
                         DEACON
               Will that work?
                         MATT
               I don't know. But it's kind of fun. We
               just wrote this whole thing about the
               girls' locker room.
                         FRED
               One thing, though. If our motto is "by
               virgins, for virgins," I was thinking we
               should put a picture of one of us on the
               web site to sort of sell the image.
                         MATT
               You're not putting my picture up there.
                         DEACON
               It doesn't really have to be one of us,
               though, does it?
     He grabs the yearbook.
     INSERT:

     web site, hawking the first feature film (coming soon) of
     After School Special with the motto, "By Virgins, For

     A quick knock on the door and Deacon's Mom comes in.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Deacon, look who's here. Your friend,
               Jake.
     Jake enters, all smiles.
                           JAKE
               Hi, guys.
     Fred quickly shuts off the monitor.

          What the hell's going on, Sphincter?
                    DEACON
          What are you doing here?
                    JAKE
          I saw the strippers. And some crack whore
          named Saffron came over my house the
          other day looking for you guys.
                    FRED
          We don't know what you're talking about.
Jake takes some pages off the printer.
                    JAKE
          What's this? "Oh, my God. There's a boy
          at the door looking at us naked in the
          shower."
He flips a page.

          "The A/V Club Secretary lathers all of
          their glistening bodies. 'I'm so dirty,'
          she moans." What the hell kind of crap is
          this? Are you guys running a whorehouse
          or something?
                    DEACON
          No.
                    FRED
          Are you crazy?
                    MATT
          They're not whores if we film them, you
          moron.
Deacon can't believe Matt just blew it. Fred smacks him.
                    JAKE
          You retards are making a porno movie?
                    DEACON
          You can't prove anything.

                 A stripper. Her name's Ashley.
     He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake
     checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new
     best friend.
                           JAKE
                 Who's the guy?
     A beat.
                           JAKE (CONT'D)
                 Well, maybe I could do it.
                           DEACON
                 No, that's not a good idea.
                              JAKE
                 Why not?
                           FRED
                 It's a lot harder than it looks.
                           JAKE
                 You don't think I can do it? Trust me,
                 I've nailed enough girls.

     Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The
     guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far
     away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a
     conservative high school girl's outfit.
     The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a
     movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound
     equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly
     like the high school yearbook offices.
     Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk
     over to Ashley.

          Okay.
                    MATT
          Okay. So I want you to play this very
          understated. It's a very visceral scene,
          so it's important not to play it too over
          the top.
                     ASHLEY
          Uh huh.
              (beat)
          Hey, did you guys shave or something?
Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless.

          Okay. I think we're ready here.
Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on.

Deacon pushes him over to position.
                    MATT
          Ashley, get into position.
Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially.
One last reality check before they take the leap.
                    FRED
          Are we actually going to do this?
They look over at Ashley. She's waiting.
                    DEACON
          I guess so.
They return to position.
                    MATT

                I hope no one catches me because I forgot
                to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God,
                yeah.
      FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling.
      DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts.

      closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands
      steady.

      Matt is quivering.

          Come on, Jake. We're filming.
                    JAKE
          All right. Hang on a second.
He has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't
risen. Fred lets the boom mike sag a bit.
                    FRED
          My arm's getting tired.
                       ASHLEY
          So's his.
                       MATT
          Action...
Jake finally whips off his underwear and faces Ashley.
                       ASHLEY
          That's it?
                    JAKE
          Hey, it's not hard yet.
                    ASHLEY
          I can see that.
Fred snickers and Jake gives him the evil eye.
                    DEACON
          Um, okay. Ashley, maybe you can help him
          out.
She grabs his joint and Jake freezes. He remains motionless,
focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the
floodgates closed. Approximately one point three seconds
later...
                       ASHLEY
          Aaaahhhh!

                    MATT
          Wait! I'm not set up for that shot!
                    FRED
          Can I put down the boom?
                    DEACON
          Jake? What's happened?
Jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts.
                    JAKE
          This has never happened before. She got
          me too excited.
                    ASHLEY
          Me? How did you ... without even getting
          hard first?
                    JAKE
              (copping an attitude)
          What do you want to hear? I've got a tiny
          pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor?
          Sometimes before I get a boner? Okay?
                    DEACON
          Calm down, Jake. We can shoot this scene
          again. Just relax. We can splice it
          together.
                    MATT
          We'd have to do it like twenty times to
          get enough footage.
                    JAKE
          I'm out of here. And if you dickwads tell
          anybody about this, first I'll kill you,
          and then I'll bust you guys.
He pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and
leaves.
                      ASHLEY
          Now what?
The guys regroup, away from Ashley. The moment of truth: How
far are they willing to go?
                    MATT
          Deacon. You do it.
                      DEACON
          No way.
                    MATT
          Come on. This is your big chance.

                     MATT
          Come on.
                     FRED
          You.
                    MATT
          I have to run the camera.
                    FRED
          Oh, like you're the only one who can do
          that.
                    MATT
              (false bravado)
          Fine. I'll do it. I'll do it for the sake
          of the film. Hold this.
He hands the camera to Deacon and starts taking off his
shirt. The rest of them look at Matt with his shirt off.
                    DEACON
          Matt. Stop it.
                    MATT
          No, I'll do it.
He desperately wants someone to hold him back.
                    FRED
              (grabs him)
          Matt!
They huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Look, guys. Maybe we should just pay
          Ashley and chalk this up to a failed
          experiment.
                    MATT
          Fine with me.
                    DEACON
          No. We can get someone else.

      spills her latté on her shirt. People start laughing, but

                Deacon, wait. Block me for a second while
                I change my shirt.

                Oh.
      He turns around and she changes her shirt behind him. Deacon
      can't help but sneak a peek.
                          NAOMI
                I haven't seen you around here in a

                            MATT
               Cool.
66   INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        66
     Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place
     with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi
     without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally.
                         NAOMI
               You know, Rachael's coming back from
               Paris in a couple of weeks.
                            DEACON
               So?
                         NAOMI
               So, aren't you even a little interested
               in seeing her?
                         DEACON
               No. There's someone else I'd rather
               see...
     He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out
     on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then,
                            MATT
               Hey, guys.
     It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing.
     Deacon shoots them an annoyed look.
                         NAOMI
               So what's this project you guys are
               working on?
                         FRED
               We can't really talk about it.
                         JAKE (O.S.)
               Yeah. It's private.
     Jake eyes Deacon intently.

                         JAKE (CONT'D)
               Why are you hanging around with this
               loser?
                         NAOMI
               What's your problem, Jake?
                         JAKE
               What's yours?
     She storms away. Deacon follows her.
67   EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT                           67
     Naomi is out on the patio.
                         DEACON
               What was that all about?
                         NAOMI
               He really pisses me off. Jake is such an
               asshole.
                         DEACON
               Tell me about it.
                         NAOMI
               When we were going out, he was so mean to
               me all the time. I think he's
               compensating for his little dick that
               never even gets hard.
     Deacon chokes on his drink.
                         DEACON
               Well at least you were smart enough to
               dump him. I mean, you deserve someone who
               will treat you ... I don't know. Really
               well.
                         NAOMI
               You know what you are?
     Deacon gets a little nervous.
                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
               You're a nice guy.
     She kisses him on the cheek. Deacon looks at her, then steels
     himself to make a decision. He kisses her!
     She's surprised, but not unwilling.
                         NAOMI (CONT'D)
               Deacon?

                         DEACON
               I've been wanting to do that for a long
               time.
                         NAOMI
               So why didn't you?
     Most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe
     with pouty lips staring you down. But Deacon passes the test:
     he stands his ground and kisses her again. She likes it.
     AT A WINDOW, Jake sees them kissing. He doesn't like it.
     AT ANOTHER WINDOW, Fred sees it, too. And for a completely
     different reason, he doesn't like it either.
68   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            68
     The set is finally ready: Ashley is lying on the bed in a
     robe, the lights and camera are set, and Matt and Fred are
     adjusting the video camera. The only thing missing is an
     actor. Deacon ENTERS.
                         DEACON
               Hey, where's Coop?
                         FRED
               He was supposed to be here a half hour
               ago.
                         MATT
               Maybe he got sucked into a black hole.
     He chuckles to himself.
                         DEACON
               Good one, Spock. I can't understand why
               you're not more popular with the ladies.
                         MATT
               Look, we're wasting time. Deacon, why
               don't you just go in there?
     Deacon balks at first, then looks over at Ashley, lying
     there.
                            MATT (CONT'D)
               Come on...
                         DEACON
               Okay. Okay. All right already.
     He pulls off his shirt and approaches Ashley with a pizza box
     from out of nowhere.
                         MATT
               And action!

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     64.



Matt starts filming while Ashley pulls Deacon near her.
                    ASHLEY (O.S.)
          Maybe I can pay for the pizza some other
          way...
We hear Deacon's ZIPPER opening offscreen as Deacon rolls his
eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:
                    DEACON
          And maybe I could throw in the sausage
          for free.
Deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.
                    MATT
          Fred, you get in there, too.
                    FRED
          Are you sure?
                    MATT
          Yeah, it'll be a great shot.
Fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of
the bed. Ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed.
The two guys are facing each other.
                    FRED
          Hey.
                    DEACON
          S'up?
                    FRED
          How's it going?
Deacon shrugs.
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Hey, did you see that show on Sci Fi
          about sun spots?
                    DEACON
          Yeah. They said there's going to be a
          massive eruption next year.
Fred starts laughing.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What?
                    FRED
          You said "massive eruption."
Deacon starts laughing, too.

                         MATT
               Hey, quit the chatter.
                            FRED
               Sorry.
                         MATT
               Hey, why don't you guys kiss?
                            DEACON
               What?
                         MATT
               You know. Make out with each other.
                            DEACON
               What?
                            FRED
               All right.
     Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused.
     Deacon holds him back with his hand.
                         DEACON
               Wait. Why do you want us to kiss?
                         MATT (O.S.)
               Because that's what guys do in gay porn.
                            DEACON
               What?
     Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC!
     He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex
     with. He can barely look. It's Matt!
                         MATT
               More sausage please.
                         DEACON
               Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!

     Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God.
70   INT. BASEMENT SET AS "MOVIE THEATER" - DAY                      70
     Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream:
     Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     66.


The set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete
with rows of seats, a bed sheet "screen," and a massive 5,000
watt light. Deacon is still a little agitated.
                    DEACON
          Where the hell is Coop? There's no way
          I'm making out with Fred.
Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring
at Deacon.
                    COOP
          What's going on?
                    ASHLEY
          Deacon is talking about making out with
          Fred.
                    FRED
          No way. I'm holding the mike and that's
          it.
                    COOP
          I thought we were doing straight porn.
                    ASHLEY
          If you guys want to do gay porn, you
          still have to pay me.
                    DEACON
          Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid
          dream I had.
                    MATT
          You dreamed about making out with Fred?
                    DEACON
          No. Well, yes. And we were both having
          sex with you. But it was just a dream so
          let's forget it.
Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly
changes the subject.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          What's with the light?
                    MATT
          It's a "special effect." If you want this
          film to look amateurish, you're going to
          have to get someone else to do it.
                    DEACON
          Okay. Relax.
                    FRED
          Come on. Let's do it already.

                    MATT
          Action.
Matt starts his cheesy "projector light effect" and Coop
takes a seat next to Ashley.
                    ASHLEY
          This summer tent-pole event-movie is
          making me so scared.
                    COOP
          Hide your head down here and I'll tell
          you when it's safe to come up.
As she starts to go down, we turn our attention...
ON FRED and DEACON, away from the action.
                    FRED
              (snide; whispers)
          How's Naomi?
                    DEACON
          Fine.
                    COOP (O.S.)
          Not yet. This is the really scary part.
                    DEACON
              (whispers)
          Hey. Can I ask you a question?
Fred shrugs. The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc
with Deacon's conscience.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          Do you ever think maybe we've gotten
          ourselves in a little over our heads with
          all of this?
                    COOP (O.S.)
          Oh, baby. Not yet.
Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face
slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then,
                    FRED
          Fire!
The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular
hole in the smouldering carpet.
                    COOP
          Unplug the light!
Deacon moves to unplug it.

                Wait, it's hot!
      Too late. Deacon touches the cord, SCREAMS, and reels back,
      knocking the light over.
      It EXPLODES onto the floor. The carpet bursts into FLAMES.
                          FRED
                Run!
      Ashley and Coop run up the stairs. Fred isn't far behind.
                          MATT
                Quick, get the fire extinguisher!
                          DEACON
                Where is it?
                          MATT
                Over there!
      He spots it in the corner and grabs it. Meanwhile the flames
      are growing.
      Deacon comes over and aims the extinguisher at the flames. He
      depresses the lever. Nothing.
                          DEACON
                It's not working!
      Matt thinks about it for a second.
                          MATT
                Oh. Me and Fred used it when we wrote the
                foamy cat fight script last week.

      Matt and Fred are giggling and prancing around the room in
      bikinis discharging the fire extinguishers at each other.

72A   INT. BASEMENT - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                    72A
      He looks around frantically. Nothing. Then, he starts the
      WASHING MACHINE. It slowly starts to fill up.
                          MATT (O.S.)
                Hurry!
      Deacon turns the dial to "large load," pauses and chuckles to
      himself.

                Deacon! Hurry!
      Deacon snaps out of it and grabs the laundry detergent
      bottle. He scoops up some water and RUNS into the other room.
72B   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                               72B
      He throws the soapy water onto the fire and Matt. The fire
      goes out, but Matt's not too happy about getting soaked.

      Coop is looking down the stairs to the basement. Fred is
      freaking out. Ashley is still topless but covering herself
      up, having just put on her panties. She goes to put on her
      shirt when
                          MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
                What's going on here?
      DEACON'S PARENTS
      are standing in the doorway to the kitchen with Max, whose
      arm is in a splint. Max stares at Ashley. She covers herself
      some more.
      Then, Deacon and Matt enter the kitchen from downstairs.
                             MAX
                Nice rack.
                          DEACON

                          MRS. LEWIS
                Max sprained his wrist at soccer
                practice. What is going on here?
                          MR. LEWIS
                Well, I'm sure there's a reasonable
                explanation why there's a naked girl in
                our kitchen. Right, Deacon?
      Deacon isn't too sure.
                             MRS. LEWIS

                    ASHLEY
          We were having a make out party.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          Where are the other girls?
                    DEACON
          Their dates stood them up?
                    COOP
          Yeah. My date wasn't feeling well.
                    FRED
          Mine has mono. From too much making out.
          With me.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          What's that smell?
                    MATT
          We had a small fire, Mrs. Lewis. I tipped
          over a candle. It was to set the right
          mood.
                    MR. LEWIS
          A fire? Let me see the damage.
                    DEACON
          Dad, don't. Let me take responsibility.
          We'll pay to have it fixed.
Deacon's Dad looks at Ashley again. He can't hide his pride.
                    MR. LEWIS
          Damn right you will.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          Well, Ashley. I didn't know Deacon even
          had a girlfriend.
                    MR. LEWIS
          Maybe you can join us for dinner tonight.
Ashley looks at Deacon. Deacon's Mom glares at Dad.

                 I think Ashley's busy tonight--

                 Okay.
     Oh, shit.
                           MRS. LEWIS
                 Okay, then.
74   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           74
     Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring
     at her. Mr. Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself
     while continuing his work-related rant.
                           MR. LEWIS
                 So get this. Johnson comes up to me today
                 and he's all like "where's the ND-90's?"
                 I'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the
                 ND-90 like six weeks ago." I've been
                 telling this guy...
                           ASHLEY
                 Johnson sounds like a moron.
                            MR. LEWIS
                 Exactly!
     Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention
     to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her.
                           MRS. LEWIS
                 So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal
                 question, exactly how old are you?
                           ASHLEY
                 Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen.
     Deacon laughs nervously.
                           DEACON
                 Isn't that funny?
     The doorbell rings.
                           DEACON (CONT'D)
                 I'll get it.

     Deacon open the door. It's Naomi.

                    NAOMI
          I thought I'd come by and surprise you.
          Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom.
She looks at him seductively. Deacon looks over his shoulder.
                    DEACON
          Now's not a good time.
                    NAOMI
          What's wrong?
                    DEACON
          Nothing. Let's talk later.
He tries to close the door, but she stops it.
                    MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
          Deacon, who is it?
Too late. Naomi comes in.
                    NAOMI
          Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's
          girlfriend.
And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his
day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect.
                    MRS. LEWIS
          His girlfriend?
She looks at Deacon. Max pokes his head through.
                    MAX
          Deacon has two girlfriends?
                    DEACON
          Shut up, Max!
                    NAOMI
          What do you mean? What's going on?
                    MAX
          Deacon's other girlfriend is having
          dinner with us.
                    DEACON
          I can explain.
Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max.
                    MAX
          This is Deacon's other girlfriend,
          Ashley.

     Dad's beaming with pride. The two girls size each other up.
                           ASHLEY

                         NAOMI
               I thought you were a nice guy.
     Naomi storms out of the house. Deacon follows, then Ashley.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               You need to have a talk with him. He
               could be having S-E-X.
                         MR. LEWIS
               I need to give him a goddamn medal.

     Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles him.

                         DEACON
               Are you insane? I've been fantasizing
               about Naomi Feldman since the seventh
               grade.
                         ASHLEY
               Fantasy and reality are two different
               things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with
               who you think she is. You have to be sure
               you love the real person.
                         DEACON
               So what should I do?
                         ASHLEY
               Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever.
     He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi.

          He's not a geek. He's the Math Team
          Captain.
                    NAOMI
          No, he should be really well-dressed, and
          maybe he's a foreign exchange student
          from Portugal.
                    MATT
          Um, and the director is the only one
          who's allowed to say "cut."
                    FRED
          Who cares, Naomi?
                    NAOMI
          Deacon agrees with me, don't you?
Matt and Fred look at Deacon.
                    COOP
          Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold.
                    ASHLEY
          I'm out of here.
                    NAOMI
          Shut up, Coop. This is important.
                    COOP
              (swings his arms out)
          And my nuts aren't?
Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's
getting up. She SCREAMS.
                    DEACON
          Are you okay?
                    COOP
          I'm sorry, Ashley.
She's pissed, holding her nose.
                    ASHLEY
          Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress
          rehearsals for a porno shoot?
                    MATT
          Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the
          script while we're at it and "improvise."

     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     80.



                         ASHLEY
               Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice
               to get paid for sitting around doing
               nothing, but this isn't helping my
               career. I've got no footage for my reel.
     She packs up.
                         FRED
               Where are you going?
                         ASHLEY
               Sorry.
     She leaves.
                         COOP
               Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley!
     Then, he blurts out something unexpected:
                         COOP (CONT'D)
                   (calling after her)
               I love you!
     Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too
     much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his
     ankles and his bare ass in full display.
     He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up
     quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down.
                         FRED
               Now what are we going to do? Your
               "girlfriend" ruined everything.
                         DEACON
               Coop's the one that smacked her.
                         NAOMI
               Besides, if you losers knew anything
               about women, we wouldn't have this
               problem.
                         FRED
               Who asked you?
                         NAOMI
               I don't have to take this.
     She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision. He
     looks at Matt and Fred for a beat, then follows Naomi. Fred
     and Matt are crushed.
80   EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - DAY                                80
     Ashley is walking through the parking lot on the way to work.

                         MRS. LEWIS (O.S.)
               Ashley?
     It's Deacon's Mom, in the adjacent lot. She walks over to
     her.
                         ASHLEY
               Mrs. Lewis!
                         MRS. LEWIS
               What are you doing here?
                         ASHLEY
               I, um, I'm... I'm going where you're
               going.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               To yoga class?
                         ASHLEY
               Yes. Exactly.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               I haven't seen you in class before.
                         ASHLEY
               It's my first time.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Well, that's great, Ashley. You're really
               going to love it.
     She escorts her towards the yoga class building.
                         MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D)
               It's really easy, but if you can't keep
               up, just follow my lead.
                                                           CUT TO:
81   INT. YOGA CLASS - DAY                                              81
     The entire class of slackjawed MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN yoga
     students stare in disbelief. Even the instructor is amazed.
     ASHLEY
     is essentially folded in half, her legs pinned well beyond
     her ears. She's obviously been in this position before.
82   INT. YOGA CLASS - LATER                                            82
     The women are gathering their things after class, some still
     eyeing Ashley jealously.

                         MRS. LEWIS
               You're quite flexible, Ashley.
                         ASHLEY
               Yeah, people tell me that all the time.
               You know, I could teach you some of those
               moves. Mr. Lewis would love it.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Oh. Okay. Maybe later. Listen, Ashley. I
               want to ask you something... personal.
               About you and Deacon.
                            ASHLEY
               Uh huh.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               You know Deacon is only seventeen.
                            ASHLEY
               Uh huh.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Right. So I was just wondering. You know.
               If you and Deacon... Well, if Deacon and
               you were...
                            ASHLEY
               Um, no.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Good. Good. That's very good.
     She gives Ashley a warm little hug.
                         ASHLEY
               Listen, Mrs. Lewis. You don't have to
               worry about Deacon. He's a good kid. If
               you just let him make his own mistakes in
               life, he's going to turn out fine.
83   INT. NAOMI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                83
     Deacon and Naomi are under the covers, making out.
                         NAOMI
               So, do you have anything?
                            DEACON
               Like what?
                         NAOMI
               You know. Protection.
                         DEACON
               Oh. Oh yeah. Of course.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        83.



She sees he's nervous.
                    NAOMI
          Don't you want to?
                    DEACON
          Of course I do.
                    NAOMI
          Then what's the problem?
Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the
taking. A long beat. Then,
                    DEACON
          It's my first time.
                    NAOMI
          That's okay. Just go slow.
And he does. He's nervous at first, not sure what to do. But
as she kisses him softly, suddenly we start to hear the slow
fade in of PORNO MUSIC playing in Deacon's head. (Now that
Deacon's actually having sex, it's involunarily triggering
the only thing he knows about sex: porno movies.) The music
grows louder when:
                    FRED (V.O.)
              (in Deacon's head)
          Every two minutes, they change positions.
He pauses, and cocks his head in confusion. He tries to shake
Fred's voice out of his head, but he can't.
                    FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          It's a basic rule of porno.
Finally, he gives in to the porno music. He rolls Naomi on
top of him.
                                                  JUMP CUT TO:
They're doing it standing up against the door.
                    FRED (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The door. Always a classic.
                                                  JUMP CUT TO:
Deacon sweeps away all the stuff from her desk and lifts her
up on it. Naomi likes it.
                    ASHLEY (V.O.)
          Fantasy and reality are two different
          things.
                                                  JUMP CUT TO:

      FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       84.



      Naomi's HAND presses up against the window. It slowly falls
      to the ground.
                          FRED (V.O.)
                It's a basic rule of porno.
                                                          JUMP CUT TO:
      Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss,
      having had her first ever orgasm.
                          ASHLEY (V.O.)
                Fantasy and reality are two different
                things...
      But Deacon doesn't share Naomi's contentment. He looks
      troubled.
83A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                     83A
      The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as
      she's getting ready to go on.
                          DEACON
                I don't know. It was weird. Is it
                supposed to be so weird?
                          ASHLEY
                Of course it was weird. True love can
                only exist between two women.
      Deacon is stunned.
                          ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do
                you like this girl?
      He hesitates a bit too long.
                          DEACON
                Of course I do.
                          ASHLEY
                Your heart is telling you that you don't.
                And I think it's time you start listening
                to your heart.
      Deacon still doesn't get it.
                          ASHLEY (CONT'D)
                Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever
                you want. Or don't. Whatever.

84   INT. DAVE'S DUPES - DAY                                            84
     Vic and Mike wait at the counter for his video copies of
     volume 28. DAVE (cameo for the director, DME) comes to the
     counter with a box.
                         VIC
               Thanks, Dave.
                         DAVE
               Vic.
     He turns to leave just as another GUY (cameo for the writer,
     DHS) comes up to Dave with a pad of paper.
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Hey, Dave, there's a guy on the phone who
               wants to set up a new account.
                         DAVE
               What's it for?
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Some outfit called After School Special.
     They turn back.
                         MIKE
               What did you just say?
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Nothing. It's for another customer.
     Mike grabs him by the collar and pulls him over to Vic.
                         VIC
               Did you say "After School Special"?
     Mike grabs the paper, drops the guy, and he and Vic rush out
     of the store. After they're gone:
                         VIDEO DUPE GUY
               Shit, man. You must be crazy.
                   (calling after them)
               Better watch your back, homie! You might
               get smoked!
85   INT. PEACHTREE & FINCH - DAY                                       85
     Naomi is dragging Deacon into the store featuring posters of
     buff male models with nut-hugging boxer briefs.
                         DEACON
               What are we doing here?

     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     86.



                         NAOMI
               What? I thought you might want some new
               clothes.
                         DEACON
               I don't need any new clothes.
                         NAOMI
               And guess what? I booked facials for us
               at the Serenity Spa.
                         DEACON
               Naomi. Wait. Stop.
     He stops her.
                         NAOMI
               What's wrong?
                          DEACON
               I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this
               afternoon. I already blew them off
               yesterday.
                         NAOMI
               Deacon, you don't have to hang out with
               those guys any more. Besides, you really
               need a facial. And I mean, I thought we
               could spend the day together. You know,
               after last night.
                         DEACON
               But what about Matt and Fred?
                         NAOMI
               Well what about me?
     She pouts. She has him under her thumb. He takes her hand and
     continues into the store.
86   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         86
     Deacon walks in really late, but wearing a hot new Peachtree
     & Finch outfit. And his skin seems to glow. Matt and Fred
     glare at him from the far end of the couch.
                         DEACON
               What's going on? Are we going to find
               another girl?
                   (off their look)
               What?
                         FRED
               Matt and I have been talking.
                         DEACON
               Yeah. About what?

                          MATT
                We want to make this movie.
                          DEACON
                I know. I do, too.
                          FRED
                No, Deacon. We want to make the movie we
                wrote. We want to make it without you.
                          DEACON
                Okay. I know what this is about, guys.
                I'm sorry about Naomi.
                          FRED
                That's not the problem, Deacon.
                          DEACON
                Then what is it?
                          FRED
                I thought this was about us having fun
                and doing something crazy together. But
                as soon as you got what you wanted, you
                blew us off.
                          DEACON
                You don't understand.
      Fred cuts to the chase.
                          FRED
                Do you even like her?
      Deacon is about to tell them. Then,
                          DEACON
                Fine. Go ahead without me.
                          FRED
                Fine.
      Matt and Fred get up and leave.

87    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               87
      The family eats dinner in silence. Deacon feels like shit.
                            MRS. LEWIS
                  So, Deacon. How'd you think you did on
                  your midterms?
                              DEACON
                  Fine.
                            MAX
                  I found a dead bird on the soccer field.
                  Its head was missing.
      Deacon's Dad pushes away his plate and gets up.
                            MR. LEWIS
                  I have to go back to the office tonight.
                  Johnson screwed the pooch again.
                              MRS. LEWIS
                  Whatever.
88    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT                                88
      Deacon's Dad gets into the Aerostar. He turns on the radio,
      which blasts a ROCKING SONG. He quickly changes it back to an
      EASY LISTENING TUNE.
88A   EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT                                           88A
      He pulls in to the lot and parks. He steps out of the car and
      starts to walk to his office. Only it's not his office.
      It's...
89    EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)                     89
      He passes the Bouncer, still reading Aristotle's Ethics.

                  Enjoy.
90    INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                      90
      Ashley is changing into her school girl outfit.
                            PLANTAIN
                  Ash, you ready? You're up now.
90A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - NIGHT                                 90A
      DEACON'S DAD enters the club and pays the cashier.
      INTERCUT:

90B   ASHLEY sprays glitter on her body backstage.                      90B
90C   DEACON'S DAD takes a seat right up front.                         90C
                          D.J. (O.S.)
                ... they work hard for their money, guys,
                so let's tip them good. All right. Now,
                on the main carousel, let's give it up
                for the naughty school girl. ASHLEY!
      Applause. Ashley struts out through the cloud of stage FOG,
      right up to Deacon's Dad...
      ... who's turned around, ordering a drink. He turns back to
      see...
      ... Ashley's back, as she swings around the pole. She struts
      by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take
      dollar bills out of their hands. She walks over to Deacon's
      Dad...
      ... but he's tipping the waitress. She does another spin
      around the pole...
      and lands in a split, face to face with...
      ... Deacon's Dad, who happens to have a crisp dollar bill
      between his teeth.
      They immediately recognize each other and FREEZE. A long
      beat. Then:
                          MR. LEWIS
                Hello, naughty school girl whom I've
                never met before.
                          ASHLEY
                You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've
                never been in.
      Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and
      quickly moves away.
91    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT                     91
      Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                You get everything done at work?
                          MR. LEWIS
                Yeah. All set.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                Oh, guess who I ran into? Deacon's
                girlfriend, Ashley.

     Dad freezes.
                         MR. LEWIS
               Where did you see Ashley?
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Over on Industrial Way.
                         MR. LEWIS
               You were on Industrial?
                         MRS. LEWIS
               You know, she is so flexible. It's really
               amazing some of the positions that girl
               can twist herself into.
                         MR. LEWIS
               What?!?
                         MRS. LEWIS
               She even offered to teach me. So I could
               move like that.
                         MR. LEWIS
               Yeah, that would be great! I mean, if
               you're into that.
                         MRS. LEWIS
               Maybe. I like her. I know she's a little
               older, but I think she's good for Deacon.
                         MR. LEWIS
               You do?
     Just then, Deacon walks past them down the hallway towards
     his bedroom. Dad eyes him with a rare combination of fatherly
     concern and male jealously.
92   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   92
     Deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye. He
     stops to look at a picture of himself with Fred and Matt from
     fifth grade. He looks really happy in the picture.
     Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday
     with Naomi. She's hamming it up for the camera, but you can
     tell from his expression, they don't belong together.
     He tosses the Naomi picture onto the desk.
93   EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT                         93
     Deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with Matt and Fred.
                         FRED
               So, what did you want to talk to us
               about?

                    DEACON
          I wanted to say I'm sorry.
                      FRED
          For what?
                    DEACON
          For blowing you guys off.
                    MATT
          That's okay, Deacon.
                    DEACON
          No, it's not. It's just sometimes I feel
          like the whole world is passing us by and
          we're just sitting still. I don't know.
          Anyway, I'm sorry.
                     FRED
          You know, you can be a real dick
          sometimes.
Then, Fred smiles. Deacon knows they're cool with each other.
                    DEACON
          Naomi and I did it the other night.
                      MATT
          No way!
                    FRED
          You're kidding, right?
                    DEACON
          No, it's true.
                    FRED
          How was it?
                      DEACON
          Good.   At first. But then I kept   thinking
          about   all the pornos. Trying to   hit the
          right   spots, positions. I don't   know.
          After   a while it kind of seemed   like
          work.
                    MATT
          I find that extremely difficult to
          believe.
Deacon laughs.
                    FRED
          So what now? Do we make this thing?

     FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       92.



                         DEACON
               I don't know. Maybe we should just call
               it quits.
                            ASHLEY (O.S.)
               Hey, guys.
     Ashley walks up to them. She looks hotter than ever, in a
     tiny midriff shirt and short shorts.
                         DEACON
               What are you doing here?
                         ASHLEY
               I need you.
                            FRED
               What?
                         ASHLEY
               I need you to make this movie. For my
               reel.
                         DEACON
               Well, actually we were--
                         ASHLEY
               Ooh, look. An eyelash.
     For the third time, time stands still as Ashley gently pulls
     the errant eyelash from Deacon's eye and offers it up to him.
                         ASHLEY (CONT'D)
               Make a wish.
     Deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take
     the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. She smiles
     and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow.
     The guys are hooked.
     Up through the window, over on Deacon's computer, the A.S.S.
     Website is running, featuring Roger's smiling face with the
     motto, "By Virgins, For Virgins." The counter is on fire.
94   INT. HAIRDRESSER - DAY                                            94
     Roger is getting his hair cut by a cute HAIRDRESSER, his
     wheelchair next to him. A few other women are in the back,
     whispering and looking over at Roger. An OPERA ARIA plays on
     the radio.
                         HAIRDRESSER
               So, I'm thinking about getting into
               films.

                      ROGER
          Okay.
                    HAIRDRESSER
          You have any tips on how to break in?
                    ROGER
          Uh, no. Not really. Acting classes, I
          guess.
                    HAIRDRESSER
          Really? I didn't think there was a lot of
          acting in those films.
Roger is confused.
                    ROGER
          Well, I guess it kind of depends.
                    HAIRDRESSER
          You think you could get me an audition?
                      ROGER
          For what?
                     HAIRDRESSER
          Come on. How long have I been cutting
          your hair?
                    ROGER
          Since I was like eight.
                    HAIRDRESSER
              (whispers)
          I know who you are. Don't worry. Your
          secret's safe. Come on. I just want to
          make one film to see what it's like.
Roger is still totally clueless.
                    ROGER
          That's great. But how can I help you?
                    HAIRDRESSER
          Oh, I get it. You help me, I have to help
          you. That's how it works. Okay.
She looks around. Then, she sprays a big dollop of hair
mousse into one hand and places it under the hair apron.
ZIP. Roger panics.
                      HAIRDRESSER (CONT'D)
          Relax.
                    ROGER
          What're you-- Oh, God!

      His face contorts to match the aria playing on the radio,
      making it look like he's singing the soprano solo.
95    INT. BASEMENT SET AS "THE PROM" - DAY                              95
      Coop and Ashley have brought some help: Plantain and the
      Bouncer. They're waiting around for the guys. The room is
      their most elaborate set so far, a hotel ball room, complete
      with themed prom banner, dance floor, stage, etc.
                          COOP
                No, no, it's a municipal bond fund.
                          ASHLEY
                But what about the capital gains?
                          COOP
                Sure there's short term capital gains,
                but the dividends are tax free.
                          PLANTAIN
                State and federal?
      Deacon enters with Matt and Fred.
                          ASHLEY
                Hey, guys. I hope you don't mind,
                Plantain and Baxter want to be in the
                movie, too.
                          BOUNCER
                Hey! Mr. Runningbear!
      Matt smiles meekly as we

      Moments later, cheesy prom MUSIC plays and a mirrored disco
      ball reflects light across the dance floor. As the couple
      dances across the floor, dressed in a prom gown and tux,
      Ashley looks into Coop's eyes.
                          ASHLEY
                Ira, I have something important to tell
                you.
                          COOP
                What is it?
                          ASHLEY
                This prom is making me so hot. I'm ready
                to lose my virginity to you tonight.

      Coop gives the thumbs up to the Bouncer, also dressed in a
      tux, then starts making out with Ashley in an exaggerated
      tongue-lapping display.
      BEHIND THE CAMERA, Matt peeks out and looks at the other two
      guys with a furled brow. Deacon gives him a forced thumbs up.
95B   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95B
      Coop and Ashley sit in the back seat of a Split Car. Coop
      says, "Oh, Rachael. You're the best." Fred looks over at
      Deacon, who just smiles sheepishly.
95C   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95C
      The Bouncer and Coop play chess as the guys capture the
      offscreen action. Ashley says, "You're the sexiest teacher I
      ever had." The guys turn their heads sideways to figure out
      the bizarre position Ashley and Plantain have gotten
      themselves into.
95D   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95D
      Plantain, dressed as a chaperone with a big punch stain on
      her dress, is eating a tuna fish sandwich and smoking a
      cigarette. Matt calls "Okay, people. Places. Let's get it
      together." Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides
      the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with
      Weylon J. Petunia's.
                          PLANTAIN
                My dress is ruined!
                          BOUNCER
                I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we
                going to do?
      She rips off her dress in one big swoop, revealing sexy
      underwear.
95E   INT. BASEMENT BATHROOM - DAY                                       95E
      Fred is in the bathroom with the Moisty-Mate, but he just
      can't seem to get in the mood. Through the door:
                          PLANTAIN (O.S.)
                I never knew chaperoning the prom could
                be so "hard."
      Fred gives up and throws the lotion back in his book bag.
      When he exits the bathroom, everyone is staring in his
      direction, then quickly looks away nonchalantly.
95F   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                            95F
      The Bouncer is going at it with an ugly sex face, dripping
      with sweat.

      Fred lowers the boom and it smacks the Bouncer in the head.
      Deacon applauds, trying to rally the troops, "Good scene.
      Good scene."
96G   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         96G
      Plantain speaks with no real enthusiasm, "I give you an A+."
      Matt asks her to do the line again, but she says it exactly
      the same way again. One more time, same result. Suddenly Coop
      lets out a huge FART and everyone starts laughing. Matt
      throws his hands up, frustrated.
95H   INT. BASEMENT SET - DAY                                         95H
      Coop and Ashley are in the back seat, post coitus.
                          ASHLEY
                That was the best prom ever.
                          COOP
                You can say that again.
      And as Ashley actually repeats her line, we see Fred mouthing
      it along with her, proud of his contribution to the script.
95J   EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                           95J
      Matt strips off the sheets, sprays them with lighter fluid,
      and sets them on fire. As the flames rise up and FILL THE
      SCREEN,
                          MATT (O.S.)
                Cut. That's a wrap.
      END MONTAGE.
96    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY                    96
      Deacon is studying in the library.
                           RACHAEL (O.S.)
                Deacon!
      He turns around and there she is: RACHAEL UNGER.
                           DEACON
                Rachael?
                          RACHAEL
                Hi, how are you?
                          DEACON
                Good. Good. How was France?
                          RACHAEL
                It was so fun. We just got back
                yesterday. The school totally screwed up
                my class schedule.

     Deacon looks her over.
                         DEACON
               So, how's John Baldwin?
     Rachael goes white.
                         RACHAEL
               Who told you about that?
                         DEACON
               Everybody knows.
                         RACHAEL
               Well everybody is a liar. I never did it
               with John Baldwin.
     Deacon is stunned.
                         DEACON
               You didn't?
                         RACHAEL
               Jesus, Deacon. I don't even know him.
               It's not like it was with us.
     It hits Deacon like a ton of bricks.
97   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                  97
     Deacon and Fred enter and see Matt sitting by the computer.
                           FRED
               So...?
                         DEACON
               How does it look?
                         MATT
               It looks great. It's the best porno film
               I've ever made.
                         FRED
               So what's the problem?
                         DEACON
               Are you done with it?
                         MATT
               Well, I cut together some footage to give
               to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think
               I can finish this film.
                           FRED
               Why not?

                    MATT
          I can't even watch it. Every time I turn
          it on, I keep thinking about that tuna
          fish sandwich and Coop farting all day
          long.
                    DEACON
          That was pretty gross.
                    MATT
          That's just it. The movie looks great,
          but seeing everything else -- all the
          disgusting, nasty stuff -- that's what's
          taken all the fun out of it. And I just
          don't want to do it any more.
                    FRED
          Great. I knew it. I knew you couldn't
          handle this.
Matt looks away.
                    DEACON
          Take it easy, Fred.
                    FRED
          No, I knew that when it came down to it,
          Matt would wuss out.
Matt snaps.
                    MATT
          You know what? Fuck you, Fred. You're the
          wuss here. At least I don't have to whack
          off every time I see a girl in the
          hallway.
Fred shoves Matt.
                    FRED
          Shut up, Matt.
Matt stands up and gets in Fred's face.
                    MATT
          No, you shut up! For once in your life,
          be a man and admit this movie was a
          mistake.
                    FRED
          Why don't you make me?
The two square off, staring each other down. Until,
                    DEACON
          No. Matt's right. This movie was a
          mistake.

                         FRED
               What are you talking about? This whole
               thing was your idea.
                         DEACON
               Come on, Fred. Didn't you think this
               movie was going to be ... I don't know,
               sexy?
     Fred looks at the other two for a beat, not sure what to say.
     Finally, he smiles.
                         FRED
               How long have you guys known about the
               bathroom thing?
     Deacon laughs.
                         MATT
               If you didn't like making the movie, why
               didn't you say something?
                         FRED
               I don't know. I thought you guys were
               having fun. I didn't want to be the wuss.
     A beat.
                         FRED (CONT'D)
               So what about the car?
                         DEACON
               The Aerostar's not so bad.
                         FRED
               What about the money and the power and
               the women? What about Tony Montana?
                         MATT
               Scar Face is just a stupid movie, Fred.
     Fred smiles.
                         MATT (CONT'D)
               So what do we do with this?
     He holds up the tape.

     The tape is burning in the center of a huge bonfire. A
     massive party is raging. Tons of teenagers are dancing,
     drinking, and having a good time rocking to a LIVE BAND.
     At the center of it all are Matt, Fred, and Deacon are
     finally enjoying themselves.

          Hey, guys. Great party.
                    DEACON
          Thanks.
                    ASHLEY
          I've got some big news. I sent the reel
          to Vivid and they want to fly me and Coop
          to L.A. to talk about a contract.
                    MATT
          Wow. That's great, Ashley.
                    DEACON

Deacon hugs her.

          Deacon! Vinnie says we need more ice!
                    DEACON
          Hang on, guys. I'll be right back.
He leaves Fred and Matt alone with Ashley.
                    FRED
          Hey, Ashley. Can I ask you a question?
                    ASHLEY
          Sure.
                    FRED
          Do you think me and Matt will ever get
          girlfriends?
                    ASHLEY
          Are you kidding? Come on, guys. You have
          it made. You're smart, funny, fun to be
          with. In a couple of years, girls will be
          dying to meet men like you.
                    MATT
          Really?
                    ASHLEY
          Well, no. Popular, good looking guys
          always get the girls.
              (off their look)
          Hey, what was I supposed to say?
Then, Roger wheels by, arm in arm with his Hairdresser. No
more braces and headgear, Roger looks sharp with slicked back
hair and suave clothes.

                I can't believe these losers are having
                such a killer party.
      Coop is walking by and overhears the comment.
                          COOP
                Hey, you're not on the list, dude.
                          J.T.
                What's with you, you pussy? Are you
                joining the retard team, too?
      Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the
      line. The high school guys stop everything to stare at her.
                            PLANTAIN
                Coop!

                Come on. You don't need to wait in this
                line. Deacon and the guys are already
                inside.
      Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without
      looking back over his shoulder for a second at J.T. standing
      there, dumbfounded. Then, the Bouncer escorts J.T. away.

                 No.
                           ASHLEY
                 You're wasting your time giving those
                 Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll
                 probably wind up unemployed wife beaters
                 anyway.
                           KELLY
                 So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody?
                           ASHLEY
                 Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if
                 you're interested, you better move fast.

                Yeah. She was.
                          ASHLEY
                You're gonna dump her.

                I don't want to. I don't know. It's not
                like it was when I was with Rachael.
                Rachael and I used to talk about stuff.
                We just, I don't know, connected.
                          ASHLEY

                Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that
                you finally figured it out.

                    NAOMI
          What?
                    DEACON
          Well, I mean, we don't really have
          anything in common. And we don't really
          even get along.
                     NAOMI
          You're breaking up with me?
              (beat)
          Can we still have sex?
                    DEACON
          Listen to what I'm saying, Naomi.
                    NAOMI
          The only reason I went out with you was
          because I thought you were a nice guy.
          And now you're breaking up with me?
                    DEACON
          Yeah. I guess so.
                    NAOMI
          If you tell anybody about this... I have
          a reputation.
                    DEACON
          I won't. You can tell people you dumped
          me if you want.
                    NAOMI
          Really?
                    DEACON
          Sure. What do I care?
                    NAOMI
          You see? You are a nice guy.
She kisses him on the cheek.
                     DEACON
          Just don't tell anyone about the movies.
          All right?
She smiles.
                    JAKE (O.S.)
          These guys are pornographers!
It's Jake, on the bandstand with the mike. He's drunk.
                    JAKE (CONT'D)
          They're perverts! They make porno movies
          in their basement!

      But no one is paying any attention.
                          DEACON
                No one's listening to you, Jake. Give it
                a rest.
      Jake gets down to confront the guys.
                          JAKE
                Oh, really, skidmarks? I know someone who
                will believe me. Your parents.
                          DEACON
                The web site is in someone else's name.
                All our records are encrypted. There's no
                tracing it to us, jerk off.
                          JAKE
                Oh, really? Well, good thing I took the
                tape of Ashley masturbating in your
                basement. When they see that, they'll see
                what kind of movies their perfect little
                Deacon is making.
                          DEACON
                Did you make a copy of it?
                          JAKE
                No.
                          DEACON
                You sent the original tape to my parents?
                          JAKE
                Yup.
                          NAOMI
                You know, Jake, you're a real dick!
      She punches him in the stomach. He doubles over and she
      uppercuts him. He flies backwards, crashing through a table.
                          DEACON
                Jesus.
                          MATT
                You should probably avoid pissing her
                off.
                          DEACON
                Noted. Guys. We've got a problem.

                 Not so fast, ladies.
       It's Vic and Mike, and Mike points his gun at Deacon's head.
                           VIC (CONT'D)
                 Which one of you is Balls McLongcock?
       Matt and Deacon give up Fred.
                              VIC (CONT'D)
                 Good name.
                              FRED
                 Thanks.
                           VIC
                 Too bad you're not going to be able to
                 use it any more.

                 The competition. And who the hell are
                 you, coming into my town, paying girls
                 double what I'm paying them? This stupid

       Deacon, Matt, and Fred are bound and gagged, and hanging by
       their pants from meat hooks. Mike takes their gags off and
       they starts whimpering.
                           MATT
                 Please don't kill us, Mr. Porno Man.
                           VIC
                 Relax. We're not going to kill you.
       The guys let out a collective sigh of relief. Thank God.
       A beat.
       Then Mike pulls out the HEDGE CLIPPERS.
                           MIKE
                     (matter of fact)
                 We're going to cut your balls off.

                 What?!?
       The guys freak out, but Mike's gun keeps them in place.
                           VIC

                 Start with him.

                           MIKE
                 Quit squirming. It hurts a lot more if
                 you struggle.
       Vic starts undoing Deacon's belt.

Deacon is CRYING like a little girl. Fred also sobs
uncontrollably, creating a cacophony of boyhood terror.
Mike goes in for the cut...
                    MATT
          We've got pre-orders!
Mike stops and looks back at Vic.
                    VIC
          What did you say?
                    MATT
          We pre-sold copies of our video.
                    VIC
              (condescending)
          How many? Fifty? A hundred?
                    MATT
          No. Sixty-three thousand, two hundred
          twelve.
                      VIC
          What?
                    MIKE
          That's a lot of product, Vic.
                    FRED

          We'll give you the website if you let us
          go.
Vic looks at Mike for a second, then shrugs. Mike closes the
hedge clippers and they untie the kids and let them down.
Deacon pulls up his pants.
                    VIC
          Okay, so what's your cut?
                      DEACON
          Nothing.

                And what's that?
      Matt puts his arm around around Vic's shoulder.
                          MATT
                The key is to try and remember what it
                was like before you had sex. What did you
                used to fantasize about? A math teacher
                who bends over a little too far. The door
                to the girls' locker room open just a
                sliver. Going over to visit your friend
                and catching his mother coming out of the

                Not you. Deacon's mom.

                 How are you going to explain this?
       He holds up the REPORT CARD.
                           MRS. LEWIS
                 How did you manage to get a "C" in
                 biology?
       Deacon is in shock: relieved, confused, and a little angry.

                    DEACON
          Is that what this is about? My biology
          class? It's just a stupid midterm grade.
                    MR. LEWIS
          I don't like your tone, mister.
                    DEACON
          Mom, Dad. I'm seventeen now. I'm driving.
          I've got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we
          broke up. But you guys treat me like a
          kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a
          normal teenager with a normal life?
                    MRS. LEWIS
          You broke up with Ashley?
                    DEACON
          No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun
          with my friends, okay?
They look him over. Finally,
                    MR. LEWIS
          Okay, then. Just make sure you don't
          repeat this performance on your finals.
                      DEACON
          I won't.
Relieved, he walks out into the Foyer. Max appears from
around the corner with the tape. They walk together.
                    DEACON (CONT'D)
          How much do you know?
                    MAX
          Pretty much everything. Mr. Slam.
Max hands him a piece of paper.
                    MAX (CONT'D)
          These are my demands.
He looks them over.
                     DEACON
          Done.
              (beat)
          Did you know all along?
                    MAX
          Are you kidding? Who do you think made
          the first pre-order?

      Max hands him the tape and they shake hands. Deacon turns to
      Matt and Fred waiting in the foyer. They're relieved.

                          FRED
                I'm really nervous.
      DEACON puts his arm around his shoulders.
                          DEACON
                My advice is to go slow. If you feel
                you're losing control, just try to relax.
                Don't worry. It's easier than it looks.

      Deacon drives the minivan home and pulls in next to the brand
      new convertible sports car. Deacon gets out, excited.
                          MR. LEWIS
                What do you think?
                          DEACON
                This is for me?
                          MR. LEWIS
                Are you crazy? It's for me. You want a
                new car, you get an after school job.
      Deacon's Mom is wearing a sexy outfit and carries an
      overnight bag. She's beaming.
                          MRS. LEWIS
                But we are letting you have the Aerostar.
                It may not be "cool," but it'll get you

                Thanks, guys. Really.

      Deacon pulls the minivan into the parking lot. In the
      passenger seat is Fred. In the back seat are Matt, Max, and
      Max's three FRIENDS. They all get out and the freshmen
      scamper away. Matt is holding Deacon's driver's license.
                          MATT
                It's not even in focus. This is really
                shoddy work.
      Deacon takes it back from him.
                          MATT (CONT'D)
                So, guys. I decided I'm going to apply to
                NYU next year. The film school.
                          FRED
                Too bad we burned the film. You could
                have submitted it as your sample.
                          MATT
                Good idea, Balls.
      The guys start laughing.
                          FRED
                So, I guess we all got what we deserved.
                No money, no power, no women.
                          MATT
                Tony Montana would be pissed.
      Just then, Rachael spots them and walks over.
                          DEACON
                Speak for yourself, guys.
                          RACHAEL
                Hey, guys. Deacon.
      Deacon KISSES her. The other two guys are stunned.

      Deacon walks down the hallway with Matt and Fred, and holding

                Hey, guys. Hey, Deacon. I heard Naomi
                broke up with you.
                          DEACON
                Yeah. But I think it worked out better
                this way.

Rachael smiles.
                    WENDY
          Hey, Fred. I hear you know a thing or two
          about giving women pleasure.
Fred freezes. He steels himself, trying to build up the nerve
to say what he wants to say. Then,
                    FRED
          No, I don't.
She's disappointed. The whole gang hangs their heads. Then,
                    FRED (CONT'D)
          Matt knows a thing or two about
          pleasuring women. I know everything.
Fred smiles ear to ear. Wendy laughs, duly impressed.
                    WENDY
          We should go out some time.
Kelly looks at Matt seductively.
                    KELLY
          Maybe all four of us could go out.
                    MATT
          That could work, you know, depending on
          my schedule.
                    WENDY
          Cool. So call me.
They walk off just as Jake pushes Deacon from behind.
                    JAKE
          Watch where you're going, sphincter boy.
But he's dealing with a totally new and improved Deacon now.
                    DEACON
          I thought I told you not to call me that
          anymore.
                    JAKE
          What are you going to do about it?
                    DEACON
          Some people never learn.
Matt pulls out a funky remote control. He hits a button and
all the monitors come on up and down the hallway. Students
stop to look up at them.

                 tape back to us.
       The video starts repeating in continuous loop, but has been

       Students point and laugh at him, while Deacon and the guys
       continue on down the hallway, dancing to the beat. Deacon
       kisses Rachael goodbye.

                           FRED

                           DEACON
                 About how making the movie didn't turn
                 out to be so fun. I think I figured out
                 why.

                  I think he's got something there. Making
                  that movie felt like we were tampering
                  with forces we couldn't possibly
                  understand.
                            DEACON
                  Exactly. The fun part about high school
                  is unravelling the mystery of what's
                  going to happen next.
       The guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. In

                   Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there
                   in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our
                   flight to Chicago.
          
                                  JACK
                   Yeah, I think he is.
                        (waves)
                   Hey, Fred!
          
          FRED recognizes Jack.

                                  P.A. SYSTEM (female v.o.)
                   Oh, really, Vernon! Why pretend? We both
                   know perfectly well what it is you're
                   talking about. You want me to have an
                   abortion.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTEM (male v.o.)
                   It's really the only sensible thing to do.
                   If it's done properly, therapeutically,
                   there's no danger involved.

                   Have you considered that what's inside me
                   is a human being; that it's alive. We made
                   love. It's us -- you and me.
          
                                  P.A. SYSTER (male v.o.)
                   That isn't true. A fetus at this stage is
                   not a human being, nor is it a person.

          People are rolling down the conveyor belt of a baggage

                                  STRIKER
                   I came home early and found your note. I
                   guess you meant for me to read it later.
                   Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I just don't want to go over it any more.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I know things haven't been right for a
                   long time, but it'll be different. If
                   you'll just be patient, I can work things
                   out.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I have been patient and I've tried to
                   help, but you wouldn't even let me do
                   that.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Don't you feel anything for me at all any
                   more?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It takes so many things to make love last.
                   Most of all it takes respect. And I can't
                   live with a man I don't respect!
          
          She leaves.

                   like you to tell her mother that we found
                   a donor an hour ago.
          
          On his desk is a beaker containing a beating heart.

                   can change.

                   an airplane since the war. And even if I
                   could, they wouldn't hire me because of my
                   war record.

                   You expect me to believe that?
          
          In the b.g. the Elderly Woman staggers to her feet and is
          immediately run over by another electric cart.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It's the truth. What's hurt you the most
                   is your record since the war. Different
                   cities, different jobs, and not one of
                   them shows you can accept any real
                   responsibility.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   But if you'll just give me...
          
                                  ELAINE
                   It's too late, Ted. When I get back to
                   Chicago, I'm going to start my life all
                   over again. I'm sorry.
          
          She walks off. Dramatic MUSIC as Striker glares with
          determination. The religious Zealot tries to pin a flower on
          his lapel.

                   Hello, we'd like you to have this...
          
          Without looking, Striker decks the Zealot with one punch. He
          walks after Elaine.

          statue on the dashboard.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Any word on that storm lifting over Salt
                   Lake, Clarence?
          
          TEXACO SERVICE MAN is cleaning windshield.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Unlikely, Victor. I just reviewed the Area
                   Report for 1609 hours through 2400 hours.
                   That's an occluded front stalled over the
                   Dakotas -- backed up all the way to Utah.
          
          Texaco Service Man opens hood and checks dipstick.
          
                                  BASTA
                   If it decides to push over into the Great
                   Lakes it could get plenty soupy. How about
                   the southern route, around Tulsa?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   I double checked the terminal forecast and
                   winds aloft. IFR ceilings all the way.
          
          Oveur gives charge card to Texaco Man.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Where do they top out?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Well, there's some light scattered cover
                   at twenty thousand with icing around
                   eighteen.
          
                                  BASTA
                   Looks like the original flight plan over
                   Denver is still the best bet.
          
          Oveur signs charge form and gives it to Texaco Man.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Denver it is.

                        (to Murdock)
                   Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard.
                   Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
          
                                  BASTA
                   How do you do, Roger?

          He tosses her his watch.
          
                                  GIRL
                   Oh, but it's your watch. You shouldn't.
                   You'll need it.
          
          She is now knocking down posts as she keeps up with the
          accelerating plane.
          
                                  SOLDIER

                                  SOLDIER

                   Yes. Thank you.
          
          Elaine turns and is shocked to see Striker approaching his
          seat.
          
                                  ELAINE

          Striker sits down.

                   No wonder you're upset. She's lovely. And

                   Yes, I know. Things used to be different.

                   during the war.

          Striker is seated at bar in a smoke-filled room. An
          assortment of unsavory characters are hanging around the
          bar.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I was in the Air Force, stationed in
                   Drambuie, on the Barbary Coast. I used to
                   hang out in the Magumba Bar.

                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I didn't go there that night to fall in
                   love, I just dropped in for a couple of
                   drinks.

          He turns to look toward dance floor.

                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   It hit me like a thunderbolt. I had to ask
                   the guy next to me to pinch me to make
                   sure I wasn't dreaming.
          
          Striker asks the burly LONGSHOREMAN next to him to to pinch
          him. Longshoreman gives him a look and moves away
          cautiously.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I was afraid to approach her, but that
                   night, fate was on my side.
          
          Elaine's dancing partner is stabbed in the back and falls to
          the grould. No one notices but Striker who eagerly fills in.
          They make a perfect disco couple. The other dancers make a
          circle around them.
          
          They begin with fancy disco steps, move on to flips and
          seemingly impossible acrobatics, finally ending with
          incredible stunts: Striker, jumping through flaming hoops
          and Elaine, hanging from a chandelier by her teeth and
          twirling.

                   wanted it to end and I guess I still

                   It's just that when I start to talk about
                   Elaine, I get so carried away -- I lose

                   Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You
                   see, I'm a teacher in the New York City
                   school system, and I was attending a
                   seminar on visual aids to education. Are
                   you from L.A.?
          
                                  MILTON
                   No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a
                   lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's
                   Assocation.

          Elaine is taking orders from a couple and their eight year
          old son.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Would you like to order dinner now?
          
                                  MR. HAMMEN
                   Yes. Steak for Joey and my wife and I will
                   have the fish.
          
                                  JOEY
                   When can I see the cockpit, Dad?
          
                                  MR. HAMMEN
                   Well, I think that the pilots are too busy
                   flying the plane for that, Joey.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Aw, gee whiz.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I tell you what, Joey. I'll talk to the
                   Captain and see what I can arrange.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Gee! That'd be swell!
          
          Elaine moves on to the two Black Dudes.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Would you gentlemen care to order your
                   dinners?
          
          The Black Dudes point to their selections on the menu.
          
                                  BLACK DUDE #1

          Randy is taking dinner orders from Hari Krishnas.
          
                                  RANDY
                   May I take your dinner order?
          
                                  HARI KRISHNA #1
                   No, thank you, we brought our own
                   vegetables.
          
                                  HARI KRISHNA #2
                   But we would like some hot water for our
                   tea, please.
          
          Randy moves on.

          INT. PASSENGER CABIN - STEWARDESS ALCOVE - NIGHT
          
          Elaine is replacing a magazine and catches sight of Striker.
          
          ELAINE'S POV - STRIKER
          
          Boring another passenger.
          
          BACK TO ELAINE 
          
          She moves into the alcove and begins to pour coffee. CAMERA
          MOVES INTO CLOSEUP of Elaine.

          EXT. BEACH - DAY
          
          Striker and Elaine are running. She falls down at the
          water's edge, exhausted. Striker drops to his knees and they
          embrace passionately. A huge wave washes over them covering
          them completely. When the wave recedes, they're still locked
          in the same embrace. They are covered with seaweed. Fish are
          flopping around in the sand.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, Ted, I never knew I could be so happy.
                   These past few months have been wonderful.
                   Tomorrow why don't we drive up the coast
                   to that little seafood place and...
          
          Striker frowns.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   What's the matter?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   My orders came through. My squadron ships
                   out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very
                   important mission.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about
                   you so much.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I love you, Elaine.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I love you.
          
          They embrace. Another huge wave washes in and covers them
          completely.

                   We have a visitor.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Hello.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Hi.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   This is Captain Oveur. Mister Murdock and
                   Mister Johnson. This is Joey Hammen.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Come on up here. You can see better.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Joey, here's something we give our special
                   visitors. Would you like to have it?
          
          He gives Joey a small toy airplane and puts his arm around
          him.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Thank you. Thanks a lot!
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Have you ever been in a cockpit before?
          
                                  JOEY
                   No, sir. I've never been up in a plane
                   before.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Have you ever seen a grown man naked?
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Do you want me to check the weather,
                   Clarence?
          
                                  OVEUR
                        (looking at Joey)
                   No, why don't you take care ot it?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   We'd better get back now.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd
                   like to.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Could I?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Okay, if you don't get in the way.
          
          Elaine exits. Murdock picks up phone.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Flight two-zero-niner to Denver radio.
                   Climbing to cruise at forty-two thousand.
                   Will report again over Lincoln. Over and
                   out.
          
          Joey has been paying very close attention to Murdock, and
          suddenly recognizes him.
          
                                  JOEY
                   Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem
                   Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the
                   Los Angeles Lakers!
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   I'm sorry, son, but you must have me
                   confused with someone else. My name is
                   Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
          
          He turns to Basta.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Ah, Victor, why don't you get the
                   coordinates on the altitude vector and
                   find out the ratio of direct velocity over
                   engine speed?
          
          Victor is puzzled.
          
                                  JOEY
                   You are Kareem. I've seen you play. My
                   Dad's got season tickets!
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   I think you should go back to your seat
                   now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
          
                                  OVEUR
                   No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him
                   stay up here.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   All right. But just remember, my name is
                   Roger Murdock.
          
          He points to his nametag.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   I'm an airline pilot.
                        (to Oveur)
                   Ah, Clarence, according to my
                   calculations, with this tailwind we ought
                   to be able to make up an additional
                   fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
          
                                  JOEY
                   I think you're the greatest. But my Dad
                   says you don't work hard enough on
                   defense.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                        (into microphone)

                   niner intersecting Victor Airway seven-
                   niner-niner.
          
                                  JOEY
                   ...and that lots of times you don't even
                   run down court.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   We are turning left to a heading of zero-
                   niner-niner.
          
                                  JOEY
                   ...and that you don't really try, except
                   during the playoffs.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my
                   buns every night.
          
          Murdock realizes he has given himself away. He quickly looks
          to see if Oveur is listening. Oveur is busy checking
          instruments. Murdock grabs Joey by the collar and whispers
          angrily.
          
                                  MURDOCK
                   Listen, kid, I've been hearing that crap
                   ever since I was at UCLA. Tell your old
                   man to drag Unseld and Lanier up and down
                   the court for forty-eight minutes.
                        (into mike)
                   Ah...Denver Control, this is Flight two-
                   zero-niner continuing on a heading two-
                   niner-niner...niner, ah...niner...niner.

                   Elaine, just hear me out. I know things
                   haven't been right for a long time. But it
                   will be different...like it was in the
                   beginning. Remember?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I remember everything. All I have are
                   memories.
          
          Soft MUSIC begins.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Mostly I remember...the nights when we
                   were together. I remember how you used to
                   hold me...and how I used to sit on your
                   face and wriggle...and then afterwards how
                   we'd watch until the sun came up. When it
                   did, it was almost like...like each new
                   day was created...only for us.
          
                                  STRIKER

                   It's a big building where the generals
                   meet. But that's not important right now.
                   They've cleared you of any blame for what
                   happened on that raid. Isn't that good
                   news?

                   Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in
                   a week. Isn't that wonderful?
          
          In the b.g., a doctor in a white lab coat is attending a
          patient. When he turns around WE SEE he is wearing an STP

                   got a brick fireplace and a cute little

                                  RANDY
                   Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I
                   might be able to cheer her up.

                   Of course.
          
          Randy takes the guitar and walks down the aisle. The guitar
          clonks people on the back of the head. Randy approaches

                   Jordan, to find where it flows to the

          Stewardesses and passengers notice the singer and peer
          around corners and over seat backs. A man's head peers
          upside down from the TOP OF THE FRAME.
          
                                  RANDY
                   'I looked in the eyes of the cold and the
                   hungry and saw that I was looking at me.'
          
          As singing continues, Shirley and Jack look at each other
          with saccherine smiles, the Hammens do the same, then the
          Krishnas, then the Black Dudes. Finally, everyone is smiling
          sweetly at each other.

          Randy, in her growing enthusiasm, swings her guitar,
          knocking the I.V. connection tube from Lisa's arm. The I.V.
          squirts, and Lisa turns pale and hollow­cheeked. No one else
          notices.
          
                                  RANDY
                   'And it flows through you, and it flows
                   through me. There is only one people, we
                   are one and the same.'

                   the Father, we are the son.'
          
          Randy again knocks I.V. from Lisa's arm with guitar as the
          passengers start to get into the music.
          
                                  RANDY
                   'In the Dawn of Creation. We are one.'

          react. Mrs. Davis pounds Lisa's chest.

                   Not so good. We've got some heavy stuff
                   ahead of us. It might get rough again
                   unless we can climb on top. But our

                   away from things as possible. So Elaine
                   and I joined the Peace Corps. We were
                   assigned to an isolated tribe, the
                   Molombos.

          Striker and Elaine are being escorted to the chief's hut by
          two GUARDS. We hear Jungle Animal SOUNDS. The chief is
          standing in front of his hut surrounded by several TRIBESMEN
          who are making the jungle animal sounds.

                   They had never seen Americans before.
          
          When Striker and Elaine arrive, the CHIEF holds up his hands
          and the sounds stop.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   At first, they didn't know what to think
                   of us; but soon we gained their trust.
          
          The Chief extends his right hand for conventional handshake.
          Striker shows him power grip. When the Chief is pleased,
          Striker gives him five. The Chief pauses then decks Striker.

                   It really was a challenge during the year
                   introducing them to our Western culture.

                   You must understand that these people had
                   been completely isolated from
                   civilization.
          
          Striker demonstrates a two-handed set shot to natives. He
          misses.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   No one had ever outlined a physical
                   fitness program for them and they had no
                   athletic equipment.
          
          Native examines basketball for first time. After two slow
          dribbles, he gracefully feints lefts, then, dribbling
          through his legs, sinks a two-hand, over-the-head, reverse
          dunk shot.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   We also emphasized nutrition and taught
                   them to watch their diets.
          
          Another native hits a long jump shot.

                   The exercise improved their physical
                   fitness and condition.
          
          One shot after another swishes through the basketball rim.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   My working with them seemed to reinforce
                   our objectives of group cooperation and
                   controlled-competitive activity.
          
          Striker approaches Elaine who is standing on the sideline.
          As they talk, the natives are passing the ball around and
          shooting baskets Harlem Globetrotter fashion.

                   Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time
                   for us to go back home -- to the plans we
                   made before the war.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   A lot of people made plans before the war.
                   Like George Zipp.
          
          Elaine walks away, dejectedly. CAMERA STAYS with Striker as
          he pours Gator-Ade into a glass.
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   I guess it was at that moment that I first
                   realized Elaine had doubts about our
                   relationship. And that as much as anything
                   else led to my drinking problem.
          
          Striker has a problem drinking. He raises his glass of
          Gator-Ade, then suddenly pours it on his forehead.

                   find out what the two sick people had for

                   Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And
                   Randy says there are five more cases, and
                   they ate fish, too.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What
                   did the navigator eat?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   He had fish, too.
          
          Oveur is picking up on the conversation.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   All right, now we know what we're up
                   against. Every passenger on this plane who
                   ate fish for dinner will become violently
                   ill within the next half hour.
          
          Oveur looks down at his dinner tray and sees skeleton of the
          fish he just ate.
          
                                  ELAINE

                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Extremely serious. It starts with a slight
                   fever.
          
          Oveur experiences what the doctor is describing.

                   Then a dryness in the throat. As the virus
                   penetrates the red blood cells the victim
                   becomes dizzy and begins to experience a
                   rash and itching. From there the poison
                   works its way into the central nervous
                   system causing severe muscle spasms,
                   followed by the inevitable drooling. At
                   this point, the entire digestive system is
                   rendered useless, causing the complete
                   collapse of the lower bowels, accompanied
                   by uncontrollable flatulence...until
                   finally the poor bastard is reduced to a
                   quivering, wasted piece of jelly.
          
          Oveur passes out and pitches forward onto the controls.

                                  McCROSKEY
                   And how about some coffee, Johnny?
          
                                  HINSHAW
                   No thanks.

                                  McCROSKEY
                   I want the weather on every landing field
                   on this side of the Rockies, no matter
                   what the size.

                   Stan, go upstairs to the tower and get a
                   runway diagram. Terry, check down on the
                   field for emergency equipment.
          
          Siamese Twins leave. In the b.g. we see them trying to walk

                   Chief, there's fog down to the deck
                   everywhere east of the Rockies. There's no
                   possible place they can land. They'll have
                   to come through to Chicago.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit
                   smoking.
          
          He lights up a cigarette. McCroskey walks toward a table and
          leans on his hands.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   I want the best available man on this. A
                   man who knows this plane inside and out
                   and won't crack under pressure.

                   Now, Elaine, right next to the throttle is
                   the air speed gauge. What speed does it
                   indicate?

                   Good. Now check your altitude. That's the

                   feet. It's dropping! It's dropping fast!
                   Why is it doing that?
          
          By now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is
          quite deflated. It is staring at her with a half smile.
          Elaine notices it.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Oh, my God! The automatic pilot! It's

                   All right, Elaine, don't worry. We have an
                   auxiliary inflation system. Just follow my
                   instructions.

                   Now, Elaine, don't panic. On the belt line
                   of the automatie pilot there is a hollow
                   tube. Can you see that?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Yes. Yes, I can see it.
          
                                  McCROSKEY (v.o.)
                   Good. Now that's the manual inflation
                   nozzle. Pull it out and blow it up like a
                   balloon.
          
          Elaine kneels over automatic pilot's crotch, puts tube in

                   are. The life of everyone on board depends
                   on just one thing: finding someone back

                   This is due to periodic air pockets we
                   encounter. There is no reason to become
                   alarmed, and we hope you enjoy the rest of

                   Well, to tell the truth, they really
                   didn't fill me in on many of the details.
                   Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.

          Carey begins to lose battle with the dog, while trying to
          remain polite.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Yeah, something like that, but as I say,
                   they didn't have time to tell me very
                   much.
          
                                  MRS. KRAMER
                   Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting
                   things happen all the time down there.
          
          Shep is growling and Carey's arm is locked firmly in his
          Jaws.
          
                                  CAREY

                   its moments...

                   ...get used to it.

          Carey is on the floor desperately fighting off the dog,
          which is on top of him.

                   It's unbelievable! How many times have I
                   warned those people about food inspection?

                   In fact, we were lucky to even get a jeep
                   since just the day before the only one we
                   had broke down -- it had a bad axle...
          
          The Indian lights a match to immolate himself. Randy
          approaches.
          
                                  RANDY
                   Excuse me, sir. There's been a little
                   problem in the cockpit and I was
                   wondering...
          
                                  STRIKER
                   The cockpit? What is it?
          
                                  RANDY
                   It's the little room at the front of the
                   plane where the pilots sit. But that's not
                   important right now. The first officer is
                   ill and the Captain would like someone
                   with flying experience to help him with
                   the radio. Do you know anything about
                   planes?
          
          The Indian holds the match, awaiting the outcome.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Well, I flew in the war, but that was a
                   long time ago. I wouldn't know anything
                   about it.
          
                                  RANDY
                   Would you go up, please?
          
          He has a moment of indecision. The Indian encourages Striker
          with an adamant nod. Striker gets up to leave. The Indian,
          relieved, blows out the match.

          Jack is sitting across the aisle from a 65-year-old
          con­servatively dressed SPINSTER. He pulls a flask from his
          coat pocket and takes a swig. She eyes him dis­approvingly.

                   Can you fly this airplane and land it?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Surely you can't be serious.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   I am serious, and don't call me Shirley!
                   What flying experience have you had?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the
                   Air Force, but this plane has four
                   engines. It's an entirely different kind
                   of flying...all together!!!
          
                                  RANDY/RUMACK
                        (all together)
                   It's an entirely different kind of flying.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Besides, I haven't touched any ­kind of
                   plane in six years.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Mister Striker. I know nothing about
                   flying. All I know is this: you're the
                   only person on this plane who can possibly
                   fly it. You're the only chance we've got.

          INT. CAR - NIGHT
          
          Kramer and a mutilated Carey are en route to airport. Kramer

          PROJECTION of passing road.

                        (into phone)
                   No, we can't do that; the risk of a
                   flameout is too great. Keep him 24,000.
                   No, feet!
          
          He hangs up phone.

                   One of the passengers is going to land
                   that plane.
          
                                  CAREY
                   Is that possible?
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Possible, but it's a hundred to one shot.
                   Thousand to one. I know this guy.
          
                                  CAREY
                   You do? Who is it?
          
          We hear A THUNK. REAR PROJECTION shows he has run oyer a
          bicyclist, who stands and gives the finger.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   His name is Ted Striker. I flew with him
                   during the war. And that won't make my job
                   any easier tonight.
          
          REAR PROJECTION SPEEDS UP to obvious FAST MOTION.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Ted Striker was a crack flight leader up
                   to a point. But he was one of those men
                   who, well, let's just say he felt too much
                   inside. Maybe you know the kind.
          
          Now REAR PROJECTION indicates car is turning and then
          weaving, but Kramer does not move wheel.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   It takes a certain type to perform under
                   pressure. Striker didn't have it.
          
          By now REAR PROJECTION is cowboys and Indians on horseback
          chasing and shooting at Kramer's car.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Ate his heart out over every name on the
                   casualty lists. The upshot of it is that
                   he went all to pieces on one particular
                   mission. Let's just hope it doesn't happen
                   again tonight.

                   people.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently,
                   so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on
                   this plane is in a desperate situation.
                   Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the
                   thrust, this must turn on the landing

          As Kramer rushes through the lobby, he is approached by a

          each one karate style, shooting the last zealot twenty feet
          away with a .44 Magnum.

                        (into phone)
                   This guy doing the flying has no airline
                   experience at all. He'll be a menace to
                   himself and everything else in the air...
                        (he pauses to listen)
                   ...Yes, birds too.
          
          Kramer enters, picks up clipboard, and reads it.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                        (into phone)
                   Okay, okay. He's a terrible risk, but what
                   other choice have we got?
          
          McCroskey hangs up phone.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Well, that's the whole story, Rex,
                   everything we know.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right, Steve, let's face a few facts.
          
          Kramer whips off his sunglasses. Underneath is another pair
          of sunglasses.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   As you know, I flew with this man,
                   Striker, during the war. He'll have enough
                   on his mind without remembering those days
                   when -- well, when things weren't so good.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Well, right now things aren't so good. And
                   while we're talking there are a hundred
                   and thirty-eight lives waiting on us for a
                   decision.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Let me tell you something, Steve. Striker
                   was a top-notch squadron leader -- a long
                   time ago...
          
          A spear slams into the wall behind Kramer.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   ...but my feeling is that when the going
                   gets rough upstairs tonight, Ted Striker's
                   gonna fold up.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Look, Rex -- I want you to get on the horn
                   and talk this guy down! You're going to
                   have to let him get the feel of this
                   airplane on the way; you'll have to talk
                   him onto the approach; and so help me,
                   you'll have to talk him right down to the
                   ground!
          
          A watermelon falls from TOP OF FRAME, splattering on the
          table.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Very well then. Put Striker on the
                   speaker.
          
                                  McCROSKEY
                   Okay, you can use the radio over there.
                   Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit
                   drinking.
          
          He pulls a flask trom the drawer and takes a swig.

                   Striker, Striker, this is Captain Rex
                   Kramer speaking.
          
          McCroskey joins Kramer at dispatch radio.
          
          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
          DRAMATIC MUSIC as we see Striker's ominous look of
          recognition.
          
                                  STRIKER
                        (dramatically)
                   Yes, Captain Kramer. Read you loud and
                   clear.
          
          INT. DISPATCH - NIGHT
          
          Kramer sits at the mike. An Air Controller is standing next
          to him, but only his mid-section is in FRAME.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right. It's obvious you remember me.
          
          The Air Controller is scratching his behind.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   So what do you say you and I just forget
                   about everything except what we have to do
                   now?
          
          The Air Controller is now scratching his crotch.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   You and I are going to bring this plane in
                   together.
          
          The Air Controller's hand is now inside his pants
          straightening out his underwear.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Before we start, I'd like to say
                   something. I know that right now things
                   must look pretty rough up there.
          
          The Air Controller is now hopping around with both hands
          inside his pants.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   But if you do what I tell you, when I tell
                   you to do it, there's no reason you can't
                   bring that plane in.

                                  STRIKER
                   Let's not kid each other, Kramer. You know
                   I've never flown a bucket like this. I'm
                   going to need all the luck there is.

                                  KRAMER
                   Stand by, Striker.
                        (to McCroskey)
                   The one hope we have is to build this man
                   up. I've got to give him all the
                   confidence I can.
                        (into microphone)
                   All right, Striker, have you ever flown a
                   multi-engine plane before?
          
                                  STRIKER (v.o.)
                   No. Never.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   Shit!

          Striker over hears conversation on radio.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   This is a goddamn waste of time. There's
                   no way he can land this plane! Route 'em
                   into Lake Michigan and at least avoid
                   killing innocent people!

                   Grab hold of yourself! You've got to talk
                   them down. You're the only chance they've
                   got!
          
          Kramer lights cigarette.
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (into mike)
                   All right, Striker, now you listen to me
                   and you listen close. Flying is no
                   different than riding a bicycle...it just
                   happens to be a lot harder to put baseball
                   cards in the spokes. Now, if you just
                   follow my instructions...
          
          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
          Two vultures are sitting on back of Striker's seat.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   ...there's no reason why you shouldn't
                   have complete confidence in your chances
                   to come out of this thing alive and in one
                   piece.
          
          INT. CHICAGO DISPATCH - NIGHT
          
                                  KRAMER
                   First, I want you to familiarize yourself
                   with the controls. Later we'll run through
                   the landing procedure.
          
          Kramer takes a last drag on his cigarette and tosses it out
          the window. McCroskey plugs his ears with his fingers and
          ducks as though Kramer had thrown a grenade. There is an
          EXPLOSION O.S.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   All right. Now I'd like you to disengage
                   the automatic pilot. But watch any violent
                   movement of the controls, like you used to
                   make in Spitfires and Phantoms.
          
          INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT
          
                                  STRIKER
                        (into microphone)
                   Okay, I'm going to unlock the automatic
                   pilot.
          
          Striker switches off automatic pilot button. Automatic pilot
          shoots upward out of the seat. Elaine is thrown to the
          floor. Striker struggles desperately to control the plane.
          
          EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                        (matter of factly)
                   Just remember, the controls will feel very
                   heavy compared to a fighter.
          
          Striker is fighting the wheel and the autopilot which is
          drifting in his way. Finally, he throws the autopilot to the
          rear of the cockpit.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   Don't worry about that. It's perfectly
                   normal. You must watch your airspeed
                   closely. Don't let it fall below 520. Both
                   your rudder pedals and elevator trim will
                   have additional play due to increased
                   drag, but you can compensate by lowering
                   manifold pressure below 154. Now there's
                   one other thing. Have you someone up there
                   who can work the radio and leave you free
                   for flying?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Yes! The stewardess is here with me!
          
          Elaine rises. The autopilot is on her back, its hands
          clinging to her breasts. She removes it and seats it at
          engineer's console.
          
                                  KRAMER (v.o.)
                   Have her take the co-pilot's seat.
          
          Elaine takes her seat as Striker regains control of the
          plane. He hands Elaine the mike.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   The radio's all yours now. And keep an eye
                   on that number three engine. It's running
                   a little hot.

                   How's it handling?
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.

                   All right, Striker, you're doing just

          MRS. SCHIFF, a middle-aged woman, is seated behind the Black

                   he's in great pain and wants to know if

          He reaches up and opens the overhead air nozzle. Air rushes
          out with hurricane force. As Jack struggles to turn off
          nozzle, Shirley is blown about, an adjacent passenger's

                                  MILTON
                   After my wife died, I felt like a fifth
                   wheel. You know, so many years being with
                   one person -- a very wonderful person --
                   makes you always think of yourself as part
                   of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was
                   lost. I couldn't function socially and I
                   couldn't function in business.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't
                   be expected to.
          
                                  MILTON
                   But I think it's time we stopped talking
                   about me. A woman like you -- why haven't
                   you ever married?
          
                                  BERNICE
                   Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's
                   all too easy to answer.
          
                                  MILTON
                   I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman
                   like you became so involved in your work,
                   you didn't have time for marriage.
          
                                  BERNICE
                   I wish I could fool myself into believing
                   that that's the reason. The truth of the
                   matter is, nobody ever asked me.
          
                                  MILTON
                   You know, here we are having coffee
                   together, and discussing education and
                   business and economy...and we don't even
                   know each other's names...full names I
                   mean.

                   Would you care for a soft drink?
          
                                  MRS. SCHIFF
                   I'd be glad to.
          
          Randy hands a large bottle of Coca Cola wrapped in a baby
          blanket to Ms. Schiff, who cradles it in her arms.
          
                                  MRS. SCHIFF
                   Ooooh, such a nice soft drink.

          The Dispatcher attempts to remove the message, but it is
          stuck in the cartridge. He yanks on it, but the paper
          stretches out like rubber. The scene now becomes like a
          cartoon. He lodges his feet against the typewriter and pulls
          until the paper stretches to his face. He grumbles in Donald
          Duck voice. The typewriter snaps back and hits him.

                   had given him more support in the

                                  McCROSKEY
                   Rex, I've decided that the best thing to
                   do is to foam the runway -- let him do a
                   wheels-up landing. It'd be a lot simpler.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey drinks.

                        (filling up another cup)
                   No, the risk of fire is too great. If she
                   starts burning, you write off all those
                   people who can't get out of there on their
                   own power.

                   Well that's better than writing them all
                   off? Are you going to play God with a
                   hundred and 38 lives?

                        (filling up another cup)
                   No. A belly landing isn't all that simple.
                   It takes a good pilot to keep from
                   smearin' himself all over the runway.

                   deserves the best shot we can give him.
                   We've gotta foam that runway.

                   His only shot's with the wheels down. I've
                   seen foam tear a man's guts out.
          
          McCroskey throws cup into wastebasket. Kramer throws cup
          into wastebasket.

                   And if Striker goes to pieces?

                        (taking another cup)
                   That's a risk we'll just have to take.
          
          Kramer throws cup into wastebasket. McCroskey throws cup

                   Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil
                   pressure. When Kramer hears about this,

                   Striker, that plane can't land itself! It
                   takes a pilot who can handle pressure.

                   Ease up, Rex! He hasn't flown for years!
                   It's not his fault. It could happen to any

                   was crazy to think I could land this

                   takes. They'd be better off with someone

                   Ya know, this would be a tough landing for
                   anyone to make. Maybe, if we hold them off
                   for a bit we'll get a break in the

          Outside stewardess' alcove. Striker fills a cup from
          drinking fountain then pours it on his head. He sits down
          dejectedly on stewardess' fold-out seat. Rumack approaches.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I know what you're going to say, so save
                   your breath.
          
          Rumack sits.
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   No. I haven't a thing to say. You've done
                   the best you could. You really have. The
                   best you could. I guess we can't expect to
                   win 'em all. I want to tell you something
                   I've kept to myself for years. I was in
                   the war myself -- the Medical Corps. I was
                   on duty late one night when a badly
                   wounded pilot was brought in from a raid.
                   He could barely talk, but he looked at me
                   and he said, "Doc. The odds were against
                   us up there but we went in anyway, and I'm
                   glad we did. The captain made the right
                   decision." The pilot's name was George
                   Zipp.
          
          Striker looks up. Notre Dame Fight Song is heard in b.g.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   George Zipp said that?
          
                                  DR. RUMACK
                   And the last thing he said to me, "Doc,"
                   he said, "Sometime when the crew is up
                   against it and the breaks are beating the
                   boys, tell them to go out there with all
                   they've got and win just one for the
                   Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then,
                   Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too
                   good. That's for sure."
          
                                  STRIKER

                   Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.

                   All right, you'd better stay up there for
                   a bit. As soon as the fog lifts, we'll
                   bring you in.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   I'll take it, Elaine.
          
          She turns to face him. A dramatic moment. Striker enters
          pilot seat and takes mike from Elaine's hand.
          
                                  STRIKER
                   Listen to me, Kramer. Doctor Rumack says
                   the sick people are in critical condition
                   and every minute counts. We've got to land

                   Don't be a fool, Striker. You know what a
                   landing like this means. You more than
                   anybody. I'm ordering you to stay up

                   and we're coming in...I guess the foot's

                                  KRAMER
                   All right, now just listen carefully. You
                   should be able to see the runway at three
                   hundred feet.
          
          Mrs. Oveur clutches Kramer's arm anxiously.

                   Aim to touchdown a third of the way along.
                   There's a slight crosswind from the right,
                   so be ready for it.
          
          Mrs. Oveur is clutching Kramer's arm with both hands.

                   of you.
          
          Now Mrs. Oveur, still watching the sky, has both arms around
          Kramer's waist, massaging his chest with her hands.
          
                                  KRAMER
                   If that doesn't stop you...
          
          Kramer is suddenly aware of what Mrs. Oveur is doing. He
          gives her a look and she removes her hands.
          
                                  KRAMER

          The Controller's face is bright green.
          
                                  RUMACK
                   This condition isn't as bad as it could be
                   if it were a lot worse.  Take these pills.
                        (hands him pills and water)
                   Here's some water.
          
                                  CONTROLLER
                   What is it, doctor?
          
                                  RUMACK
                   Two parts oxygen, one part hydrogen.
                   It'll make the pills go down easier.

          WIDE ANGLE LENS PANS the under-belly past the nose as if the
          viewer bent his head back as far as he could, until... the
          CAMERA crashes to the ground as if it has fallen off the

          MUSIC:  BIG SPACE THEME STARTS FROM TOP AGAIN
          
          PAN workers on scaffolding who check gauges on exterior of
          ship.  PAN to panel that reads, "SOLID FUEL CHUTE" -- a
          sweaty muscular worker in undershirt opens the panel, flames
          shoot out.  LOOSEN to reveal another sweaty worker in
          undershirt shoveling coal into the chute.  PAN to other
          workers checking more gauges.  SUDDENLY a PANEL EXPLODES.
          Smoking, sparking wires pop out.  A WORKER runs up with
          walkie-talkie in hand.
          
                                  WORKER

          EXT. TERMINAL - NIGHT
          
          SIMON KURTZ and ELAINE THOMPSON get out of a taxi with hand
          luggage.  They are dressed in matching flight outfits.
          
          A JAPANESE COUPLE get out of a taxi -- the man has about
          fifty cameras around his neck.  His wife hangs another
          camera on him.  He crashes to the ground under the weight.
          
          Simon and Elaine are approached by a BUSINESSMAN with
          handful of roses.
          
                                  BUSINESSMAN
                   Would you like to buy a rose to help bail
                   out Chrysler?  We're an all-profit
                   organization and need all the money we can
                   get.
          
          Simon hands the Businessman a dollar and takes a rose.
          
                                  SIMON
                        (to Businessman)
                   Here.
          
          The Businessman joins six other BUSINESSMEN carrying signs
          with LEE IACCOCA's picture.  They all smile and chant.
          
                                  BUSINESSMEN
                        (to Hari Krishna)
                   IACCOCA, IACCOCA, IACCOCA, IARAMA.
          
          Simon hands Elaine the rose.  She takes his arm as they walk
          towards the sign that reads, "MERCURY SHUTTLE."
          
                                  SIMON
                   For the best little computer officer on
                   the Mercury mission.
          
                                  ELAINE
                        (smiling)
                   Simon.
          
                                  SIMON
                   Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was
                   once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago
                   run.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged
                   to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very
                   lucky woman.
          
          A man with a suitcase on a leash walks beside them.  The
          case pulls him along like a dog and takes a leak on a post.
          
                                  SIMON
                   Women and the space program have come a
                   long way, sweetheart.  But after the
                   wedding, no more complicated computers for
                   my little girl.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   But, darling, they've offered me a chance
                   to head up the computer analysis division
                   for the Jupiter probe.
          
                                  SIMON
                   You're heading up the division in charge
                   of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
          
          He kisses Elaine and smiles.
          
                                  SIMON
                   And that's an order, Lieutenant.
          
          The man with the case on a leash passes a woman with a case
          on a leash.  The cases start a violent, BARKING DOG FIGHT.
          
          
          EXT. REAR OF TERMINAL BUILDING - NIGHT
          
          SARG (imagine George Kennedy), dressed in a tuxedo, tie
          undone, with a huge cigar, which he eats during the
          conversation, talks to his wife on his car phone.  A worker
          in hard hat waits next to him.  Behind the worker are fuel
          drums and a large sign that reads:  DANGER, FUEL --
          ABSOLUTELY NO SMOKING, ABSOLUTELY NO SPITTING.
          
                                  SARG
                        (on car phone)
                   Marge, you better go without me.  We've
                   got a condition red.
          
          SPLIT SCREEN WITH WIFE AT HOME.
          
                                  MARGE
                        (in evening gown, a cigar stuck
                         in her mouth)
                   We've got a condition red with our
                   marriage.  I think you're in love with
                   that shuttle, not with me.  I want a
                   divorce, Sarg.
          
          Sarg lights his cigar.
          
                                  SARG
                   Is there someone else, Marge?  Is that it?
          
          Sarg throws the lit match towards the "ABSOLUTELY NO
          SMOKING" sign.  The worker grimaces but nothing happens.
          
                                  MARGE
                   Sarg, there's been someone else for
                   fifteen years.  You were just too involved
                   in your work to see it.
          
          They hang up.  Sarg bites off the end of his cigar and spits
          it in the direction of the "NO SPITTING" sign, blowing the
          worker OUT OF FRAME with a MASSIVE EXPLOSION.  Sarg hops
          into his car, takes a Lava lamp from the seat and puts it on
          the car roof -- like Kojak's flasher.  The lamp flashes, the
          SIREN WAILS, as Sarg pulls away.
          
          
          INT. SARG'S CAR - ON THE MOVE - NIGHT
          
          He thinks about his wife.  SPLIT SCREEN FLASHBACK OF THEIR
          BEDROOM.  Marge, a cigar in her mouth, is in bed with five
          football players -- other half-clad athletes (hockey,
          baseball, wrestling, basketball) line up for their turn at
          her.  Sarg has to climb over them to kiss her goodbye.
          
                                  SARG
                   Don't wait up for me, sweetheart.  We're
                   testing the retro-rockets tonight.
          
                                  MARGE
                   You just can't see it, can you, Sarg.
          
                                  SARG
                   We'll talk tomorrow, hon.  I promise.

          The WILSON FAMILY -- JOHN, ALICE and ten-year-old JIMMY --
          carry luggage.  Jimmy carries a puppy in a small cage.

                                  JIMMY
                   Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
          
                                  JOHN
                   We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty
                   long trip to Mercury.
          
          A PORTER approaches.
          
                                  PORTER
                   Can I help you folks?

                        (handing him a bag)
                   Thanks.
          
                                  PORTER
                        (noticing Scraps)
                   Is that your puppy, son?
          
                                  JIMMY
                   Yeah, his name is Scraps and he's going to
                   Mercury with us.
          
                                  PORTER
                   No dogs are allowed on the shuttle, son.
          
                                  JIMMY
                   But they said...
          
                                  PORTER
                        (pulling out a handgun)
                   Scraps will have to be shot.  I can do it
                   for you here if you like.
          
          He SHOOTS.
          
                                  JIMMY
                   Scraps!!!
          
                                  PORTER
                        (laughing)
                   Just joking.  Blanks.  See, Scraps is
                   fine.
          
          Alice, John, and Porter crack up while Jimmy cries.
          
                                  ALICE
                   It was just a joke, Jimmy.
          
          Alice and John look at each other as if there is something
          wrong with their son.
          
          
          ANGLE ON MAN WITH CAGE
          
          A man lifts a large dog cage out of the trunk of a taxi.
          Inside is another man dressed in S&M leathers.
          
                                  MAN WITH CAGE
                        (to Man in Cage)
                   If we can't fit you under the seat, you'll
                   just have to be locked up with the
                   luggage.
          
          The man in the cage seems to relish the latter suggestion.
          Two Porters lift the cage onto a conveyor belt next to
          Jimmy's dog.

                                  SARG

                   Ted Striker was right six months ago when
                   he test-piloted this sucker.  And what did

          COME UP on CLOSEUP of parachute.  PAN past a flight jacket
          thrown over a chair, clothes strewn around, a framed photo
          of TED and ELAINE on the bedtable next to a bottle of
          whiskey.  The room is hot and dusty.  Ted lies on the bed
          soaked with sweat, a drink in his hand, a cigarette dangling
          from his lip.  He takes a drink and, forgetting to remove
          the cigarette, swallows it without batting an eye.  LOOSEN
          to find a CRUCIFIX above the bed with a real person on it.

                   Who could have figured it would come to
                   this.  It'll be twenty years this week
                   that I lost my entire squadron over Macho
                   Grande.  Planes, too.

          The Crucifix in b.g. looks around trying to figure out where
          the planes in the SUPER are coming from.
          
                                  TED (V.O.)
                   After the war, I couldn't go near anything
                   with a pair of wings.

                   of my pants at the stick of a 167 into

                   It's funny how fate can make heroes out of
                   cowards.
          
          The Crucifix gives a look of exasperated boredom.

          Ted wipes the sweat off his face and switches on the table
          fan.  A tornado force wind destroys the room as he fights to
          switch off the fan.

          A peasant boy takes a newspaper from a newsstand.  The
          headline reads, "MERCURY SHUTTLE FLIES TOMORROW."
          
                                  BOY
                   Senor Ted!
          
          The boy hightails it through the town-square and passes:
          
          -- A large alabaster statue of the Generalissimo snorting
             cocaine.
          
          -- Soldiers dragging nuns off screaming.
          
          -- Nuns dragging soldiers off screaming.
          
          He passes a line of peasants held at gunpoint by soldiers.
          We HOLD on them.  In b.g. are stores like HITLER'S SHOES,
          TRIEU GUYS FROM SAIGON LIQUORS, KEY'S KEYS -- GENERAL KEY
          stands in doorway.

          He runs up to THE HOTEL MONTENEGRO.  A sign reads, "TV,
          POOL, WATERBEDS, DONKEY, KLEENEX" -- All but "KLEENEX" are
          crossed out.  He runs inside.

          A black PORTER approaches and grabs a bag at the bottom of

          Simon walks into the drugstore past a DRUGGIST who whispers
          to him:

                   difficult for yourself.

                   Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you.
                   But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a
                   good provider.  I want that at this stage
                   of the game, Ted.  He might have his
                   faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning
                   of the word fear and I need that in a man.

                   'Fear,' to be afraid or over-anxious.
          
          Simon swallows a handful of pills, braces himself and walks
          out right through the plate glass window without feeling a
          thing.

          A car wash attendant opens a side door to the cockpit and
          enters in headphones, moving to "CAR WASH," with a vacuum.
          He cleans the floor and an ashtray and finds a baseball
          behind the Captain's seat which he pockets.

                   You can do it from up here, Captain.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Roger.  You better get back there and
                   monitor the regulatory unit.
          
          Elaine leaves and Mary enters.
          
                                  MARY
                   Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and
                   I don't like it.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
          
          Mary gives a "why didn't I think of that" look.  Testa
          enters.
          
                                  TESTA
                   Captain Oveur, Dunn and Unger have been
                   sucked out through disposal unit four!
          
          Mary gasps.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Both together?!
          
                                  MARY/TESTA
                   Dunn and Unger have been sucked out
                   through disposal unit four!!
          
                                  OVEUR
                   All right, calm down.  Here's how we're
                   going to play it.
          
          Mary and Testa look over his shoulder.  He has a basketball
          play diagram.
          
                                  OVEUR
                   Mary, I want you here.  Testa, you move
                   across here past Dawkins' pick and get the
                   ball at the top of the key from Irving.
          
          They all clasp hands and "yell."

                   What are you doing, Captain?
          
          Oveur eyes ROK but keeps working.
          
                                  ROK
                   I wouldn't do that, Captain.
          
          Oveur continues.  Smoke spews out.  He hears a HISS and
          looks at a vent.  He grabs his throat and collapses.

          Simon enters and spots Oveur slumped in his seat.  He pulls
          him up.
          
                                  OVEUR

          Simon rips open his coat, grabs pills and takes them himself
          letting Oveur drop.  Simon looks down at the navigational
          screen -- it resembles an old amusement parlor roadrace
          game.

                   We're off course, heading right through
                   that asteroid field and right at the... at
                   the sun!
          
          The ship takes another violent shot.

          They listen.
          
                                  O'FLANAGAN
                   Please listen.  Thank you, my children.
                   I'm a man of God, you must trust me when I
                   say... we're all going to die!!
          
          The passengers go totally insane.
          
          
          INT. MISSION CONTROL ROOM
          
          A number of Controllers group around a console.
          
                                  O'BRIAN
                   You're right.  They're off course and
                   heading right for the sun.  I've seen
                   enough, Bob.
          
          Controller 2 hits a switch and the console screen flips to
          baseball game.
          
                                  O'BRIAN

                                  CONTROLLER 3
                   McCrosky?  He hasn't handled a tower in
                   twenty years.
          
                                  CONTROLLER 4
                   Ever since Reagan fired the controllers,
                   he's been completely senile and hasn't
                   done a day's work.
          
                                  O'BRIAN
                   What about McCrosky?
          
                                  CONTROLLER 3
                   Pretty much the same as Reagan.
          
                                  O'BRIAN
                   Get him.
          
          
          INT. RETIREMENT HOME
          
          Two Nurses stand by a phone in a dormitory of beds.  Many
          old men sleep or eat in bed.
          
                                  NURSE
                   It's for Mr. McCrosky.
          
                                  NURSE 2
                   Do you think we should bother him?  He's
                   been acting a bit odd lately.
          
          They look to McCrosky (Lloyd Bridges).
          
          
          ANGLE ON McCROSKY
          
          He is in bed in scuba gear.

                                  NURSE 1
                   He's fine.  He just thinks he's Lloyd
                   Bridges.
          
          Nurse 1 takes the phone to McCrosky.  He is a lot older than
          in "Airplane."
          
                                  NURSE 1
                   The phone's for you, Mr. McCrosky.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   What's a phone?
          
                                  NURSE 1
                        (holding it to his ear)
                   Here, let me help you.  I think it's the
                   space centre.  Now, let's not get too
                   excited.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   What?
                        (pause)
                   What?
                        (pulls off his scuba mask and
                         snorkle)
                   What?
                        (gets more alert and grabs a
                         cigarette)
                   I'll be right down!
                        (he hangs up and jumps out of
                         bed)
                   Looks like I picked the wrong time to go
                   senile.

                   Captain Oveur!
          
          Elaine pulls him up.

                   Simon, what's happening?!
          
                                  SIMON
                   He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed
                   him.  That computer is running this ship
                   and we're heading right for the sun.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Can't we change course?
          
                                  SIMON
                   We're computer locked and the manual
                   navigation unit is down.
          
          Elaine looks at the floor.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Then Ted was right!

                                  ELAINE
                   Your career!  What about the lives of
                   those people out there.  Simon, what
                   happened to the man I thought I loved?
          
          She goes to the door.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   I've got to get Ted.  Just don't come
                   apart on me now, Simon.
          
          She leaves.  Simon's uniform starts bursting at the seams,
          buttons pop off.

                   Please, ladies and gentlemen, please calm
                   down.  Listen to me!
          
          They calm down.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   We've been thrown off course just a tad.
          
                                  PASSENGER
                   What's that mean?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   In space terms, about 70 million miles.
          
          The Passengers appear interested and sensible, nod their

                   The bumps you feel are car-sized asteroids
                   smashing into the hull.
          
          The hood of a car smashes through the cabin wall.  The
          Passengers still appear interested and sensible.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Also, we're heading right for the sun and
                   can't seem to change course.
          
          Passengers still appear interested and sensible.  They all
          put on sunglasses.
          
                                  PASSENGER
                   Are you telling us everything?
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Not exactly.  We're also out of coffee.
          
          The Passengers errupt in total panic.

                   She loved life.  I didn't want her to

          McCrosky sits at a monitor, talks into a mike and looks down
          at a book.  Behind him two Controllers make a dope deal -- a
          baggie of grass for cash.  We only see their midsections and
          hands.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   Striker, this is Jack McCrosky, chief
                   controller.  I want you to listen to me and
                   listen good.
          
          The buyer checks out the baggie -- it's mostly twigs.  The
          seller is trying to explain the situation with his hands.

                   Twenty years ago I helped a young pilot
                   through a storm over Chicago.
          
          The buyer grabs the seller's shirt and tries to get cash
          back.  A fight ensues.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   He didn't have a crew either.  He said he
                   couldn't do it.  But when the going got
                   tough that kid pulled it together.
          
          The seller's shirt is ripped.  Knives are pulled.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   You might have read about him; he made all
                   the big papers and the Canadian Jewish
                   News.
          
          The seller is stabbed.
          
                                  McCROSKY
                   I don't know where he is today but if he
                   was up there right now, I know he'd find
                   some way to turn that bucket around and
                   get the hell out of there, pronto!

          flies into the air in SLOW MOTION.  It turns slowly, hanging
          for the longest time as we CUT, still in SLOW MOTION, to
          horrified faces watching it.  This SLOW MOTION sequence
          lasts for about 60 seconds -- people put on make-up, do
          macrame, read, etc. -- while the case is still in the air.
          Suddenly, Scraps leaps high into the air in SLOW MOTION and

                   Striker, we're monitoring you.  You're
                   right on course.  At that speed you should
                   hit Mercury in about six minutes.  So give
                   yourself enough time to kill those WORP
                   engines.

          A boxing glove springs from the dash punching Ted in the
          face.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted, that's Alpha Beta!
          
          
          ANGLE OUT SHIP WINDOW - NIGHT
          
          We see the lights of a small colony on planet surface.  The
          Alpha Beta neon sign is visible.
          
          
          INT. ALPHA BETA COMMUNICATIONS ROOM
          
          Kramer sits in a large swivel chair -- like Captain Kirk's
          on the Enterprise bridge.  As he talks, he nonchalantly
          swivels so his back is to the huge window.  We see the
          Mayflower approaching on the screen.
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (on radio)
                   Now, Striker, there are a few things you
                   have to keep in mind as you get close to
                   the planet's atmosphere.
          
          
          ANGLE ON COMMUNCATION ROOM PERSONNEL
          
          They watch in horror as the Mayflower comes shooting at
          them.
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (on radio)
                   First and foremost you have to make one
                   very important decision.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT
          
          Elaine looks out the window -- horrified.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted!  We're not stopping!!
          
          Ted fights the controls.
          
                                  KRAMER (V.O.)
                   Is this a landing you're sure you can make
                   without endangering the lives of your
                   passengers?
          
          
          INT. ALPHA BETA COMMUNICATIONS ROOM
          
          
          ANGLE ON PERSONNEL
          
          They run for cover.
          
          
          ANGLE ON THE SCREEN
          
          The Mayflower comes right at the screen and crashes through
          it.  Kramer still has his back to the screen and doesn't
          notice what has happened -- the room behind him has been
          totally demolished.
          
                                  KRAMER
                        (on radio)
                   Now, once you've made that decision you
                   have to be very clear about your
                   responsibility to those people on that
                   ship.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT
          
          The front window is broken.  Ted and Elaine are covered in
          debris.  Elaine's eyes grow wide with terror again.
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted!
          
          
          EXT. PLANET SURFACE
          
          A group of scientists stand at a keyboard synthesizer.  One
          plays the series of notes from CLOSE ENCOUNTERS.  Suddenly
          the Mayflower appears over a hill.  They all jump for cover
          as it crashes through the synthesizer.
          
          
          INT. COCKPIT
          
          Ted and Elaine are covered in piano keys.
          
                                  KRAMER (V.O.)
                   Their lives, their futures, their goals
                   and aspirations are in your hands,
                   Striker.
          
          
          EXT. PLANET SURFACE
          
          The Mayflower bounces across the surface.
          
          
          INT. CABIN
          
          Mary maneuvers down the aisle.  Passengers are screaming and
          being tossed around.
          
                                  MARY
                        (to one passenger)
                   Seat backs up.  Thank you.
          
          She looks up and sees feet dangling from the ceiling.  A man
          has gone right through the ceiling up to his waist.
          
                                  MARY
                        (looking up)
                   Sir, you really must take your seat.
          
          
          INT. ALPHA BETA COMMUNCATIONS ROOM

                        (on radio)
                   We're all with you on this one, Striker.
                   Now get ready to position landing gear,
                   cut engines, and fire your retro­rockets.
          
          
          EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAWN
          
          The Mayflower careens to a smoking, crunching, shattering
          stop.
          
          
          INT. CABIN
          
          Mary and Testa start directing panic-striken passengers to
          the exits.

                   Timing's of the essence on a lame duck
                   approach, Striker.  Don't fight her.  Hold
                   her steady.  Nose up.
          
          
          EXT. SHIP ON A HILL - DAWN
          
          Ted and Elaine stand looking down on the wreckage.  In b.g.,
          SIRENS WAIL, emergency lights flash across Ted and Elaine.

                   be okay!
          
          Ted holds Elaine.
          
                                  KRAMER (V.O.)
                   Don't fight her, Striker.  Hold her!  Hold
                   her!  Stay with her, Striker!
          
          Ted and Elaine kiss.
          
                                  KRAMER (V.O.)
                   Now, hit your landing gear and cut those

          Ted and Elaine walk off into the distance.

                        (voice fading)
                   Now give her full flap and keep that nose
                   up.  Okay, now!
          
                                  ELAINE
                   Ted, what's going to happen to us?
          
          Ted stops and looks into the distant, dark sky.  A printed
          crawl begins:
          
          MUSIC:  OPTIMISTIC THEME
          
                                  CRAWL

          Ted and Elaine walk towards crawl and are approached by two
          strange CREATURES -- bald with a shock of hair sprouting
          from the top of their heads.

PEDDLER:    Oh I come from a land
    From a faraway place
    Where the caravan camels roam
    Where they cut off your ear /Where it's flat and immense
    If they don't like your face /And the heat is intense
    It's barbaric, but hey--it's home!
    When the wind's at your back
    And the sun's from the west
    And the sand in the glass is right
    Come on down,
    Stop on by
    Hop a carpet and fly
    To another Arabian night!

    Arabian nights
    Like Arabian days
    More often than not
    Are hotter than hot
    In a lot of good ways

    Arabian nights
    'Neath Arabian moons
    A fool off his guard
    Could fall and fall hard
    Out there on the dunes.

    Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend.
    Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting
    peddler in face) Too close, a little too close.  (Camera
    zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah.  City of
    mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this
    side of the river Jordan, on sale today, come on down!
    Heh, heh.  Look at this! Yes!  Combination hookah and
    coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries.  Will not break
    (taps it on table), will not--(it falls apart)--it
    broke.  Ooohhh!  Look at this! Pulls out Tupperware) I
    have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the
    famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open,
    makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins
    to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait,
    don't go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you're only
    interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you
    would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER
    pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be
    fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many
    things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside
    that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left.
    Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary
    lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man's life.
    A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he
    seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like
    to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the
    lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER
    throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry
    nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark
    purpose.

(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO
    on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.)

JAFAR:  You...are late.
GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one.
JAFAR:  You have it, then?
GAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out
        half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it,
        but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure!
        (IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.)  Ouch!
JAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's
        coming to you.
IAGO:   What's coming to you!  Awk!

(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects
    them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it
    flies out of JAFAR's hand, scaring the horses, and is off
    towards the dunes.)

JAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail!

(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until
    it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the
    halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing
    points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise
     up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing
    points serving as the eyes.)

JAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave
        of wonders!
IAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders!
GAZEEM: By Allah!
JAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the
        treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine!

(GAZEEM starts to approach the lion's mouth, which forms the
    entrance to the cave.  He chuckles as he goes.)

IAGO:   Awk, the lamp!  Awk,  the lamp!  (Now that IAGO and
    JAFAR are alone, IAGO opens up in normal English.)
    Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?

(JAFAR puts his finger to his lips and shushes him.  GAZEEM reaches
    the cave, but is blown away by the roar of the cave's speaking.)

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
GAZEEM: It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
CAVE:       Know this.  Only one may enter here.  One whose
        worth lies far within.  A diamond in the rough.

(GAZEEM turns to JAFAR with a questioning look.)

JAFAR:  What are you waiting for?  Go on!

(GAZEEM hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave.  With
    great apprehension, he plants his foot down.  Nothing happens.
      Relieved, he begins his trek again.  Then another roar comes.
     He turns back, but the lion's mouth slams shut and the dune
    collapses back to normal.  All that are left are JAFAR, IAGO,
     and the two separated halves of the medallion.)

CAVE:       Seek thee out, the diamond in the rough.

(IAGO unburied himself from the sand, coughing as he does so.)

IAGO:       I can't believe it.  I just don't believe it. We're
        never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp!  Just
        forget it.  Look at this.  Look at this.  I'm so
        ticked off that I'm molting!  (He flies up to
        JAFAR's shoulder.)
JAFAR:  Patience, Iago.  Patience.  Gazeem was obviously
        less than worthy.
IAGO:       (Extremely sarcastically) Oh, there's a big
        surprise.  That's an incred--I think I'm gonna have
        a heart attack and die from not surprise!  What're
        we gonna do?  We got a big problem here,a big prob-
        (JAFAR pinches his beak shut.)
JAFAR:  Yes, we do.  Only one may enter.  I must find this
        one, this...diamond in the rough.

(Cut to a rooftop, where ALADDIN rushes up to the edge, carrying
    a loaf of bread.  He almost drops it over the edge.)

GUARD:  Stop, thief!  I'll have your hands for a trophy,
        street rat!
ALADDIN:    (Looks back, then down, then at the bread.)  All
        this for a loaf of bread?

(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with
    drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits
    and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he's
    nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches
     out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the
    shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by
    numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls
     off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread
    when...)

GUARD 1:    There he is!
GUARD 2:    You won't get away so easy!
ALADDIN:    You think that was easy?

(He looks at three women, laughing at him.)

GUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll
        find him.

(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise.
    He rushes over to the women.)

ALADDIN:    Morning, ladies.
WOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't
        we Aladdin?
ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you
        get caught--

(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the
    first GUARD.  ALADDIN's disguise falls off.)

ALADDIN:    I'm in trouble!
GUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU,
        then the guard's turban is pulled down over his
        eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.)
ALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu!
ABU:        Hello!
ALADDIN:    Come on, let's get outta here!
        Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline
        One swing ahead of the sword
        I steal only what I can't afford
        That's everything!

(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of
    swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants.  ABU raspberries the
    GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN,
    but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD
     pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.)

        One jump ahead of the lawmen
        That's all, and that's no joke
        These guys don't appreciate I'm broke!

(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down
    on top of another GUARD.)

GUARDS: (one at a time) Riffraff! Street rat!
        Scoundrel! Take that!
ALADDIN:    Just a little snack, guys!

(ALADDIN scampers to the top of a platform. The GUARDS shake the
    platform back and fro trying to knock him off.)

GUARDS: Rip him open, take it back guys!
ALADDIN:    I can take a hint, gotta face the facts
        You're my only friend, Abu!
WOMEN:  Who?!?

(ALADDIN jumps off the platform to certain death, only to grab ABU's
    hands like an acrobat.  The pair swing into a harem.)

        Oh, it's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom
        He's become a one-man rise in crime

(ABU finds a plate full of fruit and stuffs his mouth full like a
    chipmunk.)

WOMAN:  I'd blame parents, except he hasn't got 'em!
ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
        Tell you all about it when I got the time!

(ALADDIN and ABU exit.  Cut to MUSCLEMAN flexing to a crowd.  The
    GUARDS rush past.  Cut to ALADDIN and ABU behind the MUSCLEMAN,
     matching his moves, until they make a mistake and are discovered.)

        One jump ahead of the slowpokes
        One skip ahead of my doom
        Next time gonna use a nom de plume.
        One jump ahead of the hitmen
        One hit ahead of the flock
        I think I'll take a stroll around the block.

(A chase sequence, in which ALADDIN and ABU, pursued by the GUARDS,
    race through a flock of sheep, hurdle a MAN sleeping on a bed of
    nails {of course one extremely large GUARD lands on him}.  ABU
     disguises himself with jewels until a SHOPKEEPER discovers him.

CROWD:  Stop, thief! Vandal!
        Outrage! Scandal!
ALADDIN:    Let's not be too hasty

(ALADDIN is surrounded by GUARDS in front of a door. The door opens
    and a large, ugly LADY comes out.)

LADY:   Still I think he's rather tasty

(ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting
    like they're all chums.)

ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat
        Otherwise we'd get along!
GUARDS: WRONG!

(They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and
    ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run
    across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down,
    screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU
    pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword
    out of the SWALLOWER's mouth.  ABU advances on the guards,
    who retreat in fear.)

GUARD 1:    He's got a sword!
GUARD 2:    You idiot--we've ALL got swords!!

(ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are
    once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right.
      He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street,
     as the GUARDS all crash into each other.)

ALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats!
CROWD:  Vandal!
ALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump!
CROWD:  Street rat!
ALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster
CROWD:  Scoundrel!
ALADDIN:    They're quick--but I'm much faster
CROWD:  Take that!

(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a
     carpet and jumps out the window)

ALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in
        Wish me happy landin'
        All I gotta do is jump!

(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to
     the street, and land in a pile with the sign "Crazy Hakim's
    Discount Fertilizer."  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute
    to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each
    other.)

ALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right!

(ALADDIN breaks the bread in two and gives half to ABU, who begins
    to eat.  But ALADDIN looks over and sees two young children
    rummaging through the garbage for food.  The GIRL sees him, then
    drops her find and tries to hide.  ALADDIN looks at them, then
    the bread, then at ABU.)

ABU:        Uh-oh!

(ABU takes a big bite of his food, but ALADDIN gets up and walks
    over to the children.  The GIRL pulls her brother back.)

ALADDIN:    Here, go on--take it.

(The children giggle with delight.  ABU tries to swallow his bite,
    then looks guilty. He walks over to the children and offers his
     bread to them.  In delight, they pet him on the head.)

ABU:        Ah, don't.  Huh?

(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade
    going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people.  He sees
    PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)

BYSTANDER 1:    On his way to the palace, I suppose.
BYSTANDER 2:    Another suitor for the princess.

(ALADDIN is startled as the two children come running out from the
    alley. The BOY runs out in front of the PRINCE's horse,
    startling it.)

PRINCE: Out of my way, you filthy brat!

(The PRINCE brings up his whip to attack the children, but ALADDIN
    jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)

ALADDIN:    Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners
PRINCE: Oh--I teach you some manners!

(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.)

ALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a
        horse with two rear ends!

(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.)

PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a
        street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only
        your fleas will mourn you.

(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut
    in his face.)

ALADDIN:    I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come
        on, Abu.  Let's go home.

(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in
    ABU for the night.)

ALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat.
        I don't buy that.
        If only they'd look closer
        Would they see a poor boy?  No siree.
        They'd find out, there's so much more to me.

(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.)

        Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We'll be
        rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems
        at all.

(Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber.
     The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the
    rear end of his pants.)

PRINCE: I've never been so insulted!

SULTAN: Oh, Prince Achmed.  You're not leaving so soon, are
        you?

PRINCE: Good luck marrying her off!

SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine!  Jasmine!  Jasmine!  (The SULTAN goes
        off into the garden looking for his daughter.  He
        finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE's
        pet tiger, who blocks him off.  RAJAH has a piece
        of the PRINCE's undershorts in his mouth.The SULTAN
        grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH's mouth.)
        Confound it, Rajah!  So, this is why Prince Achmed
        stormed out!
JASMINE:    Oh, father.  Rajah was just playing with him,
        weren't you Rajah.  (RAJAH comes over and allows
        JASMINE to pet and hug him.)  You were just playing
        with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
        weren't you?  (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the
        moment, until she looks up at her angry father. )
        Ahem.
SULTAN: Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting every suitor
        that comes to call.  The law says you...
BOTH:       ...must be married to a prince.

(They walk over to a dove cage.)

SULTAN: By your next birthday.
JASMINE:    The law is wrong.
SULTAN: You've only got three more days!
JASMINE:    Father,  I hate being forced into this.  (She takes
        a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry,
        I want it to be for love.
SULTAN: Jasmine, it's not only this law.  (She hands him
        the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I'm not
        going to be around forever, and I just want to make
        sure you're taken care of, provided for.
JASMINE:    Try to understand.  I've never done a thing on my
        own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the
        pond, petting the fish.)I've never had any real
        friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.)
        Except you, Rajah.  (Satisfied, he goes back to
        sleep.)  I've never even been outside the palace
        walls.
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you're a princess.
JASMINE:    Then maybe I don't want to be a princess.  (She
        splashes the water.)
SULTAN: Oooohhh!  Allah forbid you should have any
        daughters!

(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second.  JASMINE goes to the dove
    cage and yanks open the door.  The birds fly off into freedom.
      She watches them go.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chambers.)

SULTAN: I don't know where she gets it from.  Her mother
        wasn't nearly so picky.  (A shadow falls over him.
        He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.)  Ooh, oh.
        Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor.  I am in
        desperate need of your wisdom.
JAFAR:  My life is but to serve you, my lord.  (He bows.)
SULTAN: It's this suitor business.  Jasmine refuses to
        choose a husband.  I'm at my wit's-end.
IAGO:   (In the parrot voice) Awk!  Wit's-end.
SULTAN: Oh, ha ha.  Have a cracker, pretty polly!  (He
        pulls a cracker out from his pocket.  IAGO looks
        terrified.  Then the SULTAN stuffs it in IAGO's
        mouth.  IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it.  JAFAR
        and the SULTAN both laugh.)
JAFAR:  Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals.
        (IAGO glares at him.)  Now then, perhaps I can
        divine a solution to this thorny problem.
SULTAN: If anyone can help, it's you.
JAFAR:  Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue
        diamond.
SULTAN: Uh, my ring?  But it's been in the family for
        years.
JAFAR:  It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.
        (JAFAR says the word 'princess' with the accent on
        the second syllable, "cess."  He turns his staff
        with a cobra head towards the SULTAN.  The eyes of
        the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR's
        voice slows down and deepens.  The SULTAN's eyes
        get a hypnotized look.)  Don't worry.  Everything
        will be fine.
SULTAN: Everything...will be...fine.
JAFAR:  The diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.

(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns
    to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)

JAFAR:  You are most gracious, my liege.  Now run along and
        play with your little toys.
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized)  Yes...that'll be...pretty good.

(JAFAR and IAGO exit.  We follow them. When they're out of the room,
    the parrot spits out the cracker.)

IAGO:       I can't take it anymore!  If I gotta choke down on
        one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers...bam!
        Whack!

(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)

JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago.
IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack!
JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not
        that addlepated twit.
IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha
        ha!

(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens
    at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE
    in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.
      She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)

JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and
        have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She
        begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH,
        who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye!

(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN
    and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the
    awning of a fruit stand.)

ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go!

(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)

PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds
            will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and
            hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey,
            get your paws off that.
ABU:            Blah blah blah!
PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape!

(He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN
    dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)

ABU:            Bye bye!

(He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front,
    where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like
    he has just done this.)

ALADDIN:    Nice goin' Abu.  Breakfast is served.

(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat.  We see J
    ASMINE walking through the street.)

SHOPKEEPER 1:   Pretty lady, buy a pot.  No finer pot in brass
            or silver.
SHOPKEEPER 2:   Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs!  Sugar
            dates and pistachios!
SHOPKEEPER 3:   Would the lady like a necklace.  A pretty
            necklace for a pretty lady.

(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust
    into her face.)

SHOPKEEPER 4:   Fresh fish!  We catch 'em, you buy 'em!
JASMINE:    I don't think so.  (She backs away, but bumps into
        a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his
        fire.)  Oh, excuse me.  (He gulps, then belches
        fire from his mouth.  JASMINE is disgusted.  He is
        pleased and taps his stomach.  ALADDIN sees her,
        and a strange look comes over his face.)  I'm
        really very sorry.
ALADDIN:    (He's obviously deeply in love with her.)  Wow!

(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head.  ABU sees him and
    jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN's
    face.)

ABU:        Uh oh.  Hello?  Hello?

(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child
    reaching for a piece of fruit.  She picks one up and gives it to
    him.)

JASMINE:        Oh, you must be hungry.  Here you go.  (The
            boy runs off.)
PROPRIETOR: You'd better be able to pay for that.
JASMINE:        (Mystified) Pay?
PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart!
JASMINE:        Oh, I'm sorry sir.  I don't have any money.
PROPRIETOR: Thief!
JASMINE:        Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can
            get some from the Sultan.
PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?

(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to
    chop it off.)

JASMINE:        No, no please!

(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN's.)

ALADDIN:        Thank you kind sir.  I'm so glad you've found
            her. I've been looking all over for you.
JASMINE:        (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN:        (whispering back) Just play along.
PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?
JASMINE:        Sadly, yes.  She is my sister.  She's a little
            crazy.  (He circles his finger around his ear.
            She is shocked.  The PROPRIETOR grabs him by
            the vest.)
PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan!
ALADDIN:        She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.

(ABU is picking a pocket.  He hears this, then straightens up.
    JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)

JASMINE:        Oh, wise Sultan.  How may I serve you?
ABU:            Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN:        Tragic, isn't it?  (He leans forward, picking
            up another apple from the cart with his
            foot.) But, no harm done.  (Walks over to
            Jasmine.)  Now come along sis. Time to see the
            doctor.
JASMINE:        (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor.
            How are you?
ALADDIN:        No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose
            pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.

(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he's stolen from the cart falls
    out.)

PROPRIETOR: Huh?  What is it?  (ABU picks up what he can
            carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here,
            you little thieves!

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's lab.  IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre
    contraption.  At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)

IAGO:       (huffing and puffing)  With all due respect, your
        rottenness, couldn't we just wait for a real storm?
JAFAR:  Save your breath, Iago.  Faster!  (He places the
        SULTAN's ring in the contraption.)
IAGO:       Yes, o mighty evil one.

(IAGO runs faster.  A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing
    into an hourglass below.  The sands begin to swirl.)

JAFAR:  Ah, sands of time--reveal to me the one who can
        enter the cave.  (The sand in top forms the Cave of
        Wonders.  It falls through into a storm, but it
        shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by
        JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes, yes!
        There he is.  My diamond in the rough!
IAGO:       That's him?!?!   That's the clown we've been
        waitin' for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked
        into the gears.)
JAFAR:  Let's have the guards extend him an invitation to
        the palace, shall we?

(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)

IAGO:   Swell.

(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with
    ALADDIN in it.  Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing
    to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)

ALADDIN:    Almost there.

(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN's arms.
    She stands up.)

JASMINE:    I want to thank you for stopping that man.
ALADDIN:    Uh, forget it.  (He grabs a pole.)  So, uh, this is
        your first time in the marketplace, huh?

(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)

JASMINE:    Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN:    Well, you do kinda stand out.  (He stares at her,
        still in love.  She returns the look.  But he
        realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.)
        I mean, uh, you don't seem to know how dangerous
        Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the
        buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned
        down, she vaults over his head.  He looks back in
        surprise.  She tosses the pole to him.  Both
        ALADDIN's and ABU's eyes bulge.)
JASMINE:    I'm a fast learner.
ALADDIN:    Right.  C'mon, this way.  (They go inside the roof
        of a building, dodging planks and beams as they
        go.)  Whoa.  Watch your head there.  Be careful.
JASMINE:    Is this where you live?
ALADDIN:    Yep.  Just me and Abu.  Come and go as we please.
JASMINE:    Fabulous.
ALADDIN:    Well, it's not much, (he pulls back the curtain and
        exposes the palace) but it's got a great view.
        Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?
JASMINE:    Oh, it's wonderful.
ALADDIN:    I wonder what it would be like to live there, to
        have servants and valets...
JASMINE:    Oh, sure.   People who tell you where to go and how
        to dress.
ALADDIN:    It's better than here.  Always scraping for food
        and ducking the guards.
JASMINE:    You're not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN:    Sometimes you feel so--
JASMINE:    You're just--
BOTH:       (in unison) --trapped.

(They look at each other, realizing that they're perfect for one
    another.  But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the
    look.  He takesthe apple out of ABU's hand and rolls it down his
    arm into the hand of JASMINE.)

ALADDIN:    So, where're you from?
JASMINE:    What does it matter?  I ran away, and I am not
        going back.
ALADDIN:    Really?  (He takes a bite from the apple in his
        hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted
        look on his face.)
ABU:        Why you!

(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)

JASMINE:    My father's forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN:    That's--that's awful.  (ABU appears from behind the
        princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!

(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)

JASMINE:    What?
ALADDIN:    Abu says that--uh--that's not fair.
ABU:        What?
JASMINE:    Oh did he?
ALADDIN:    Yeah, of course.
JASMINE:    And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN:    Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do
        to help.
ABU:        Oh, boy!
JASMINE:    Hmm, tell him that's very sweet.

(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until
    ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however,
    by the GUARDS, who have found them.)

GUARD:  Here you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're
                after you?
JASMINE:    My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN:    Do you trust me?
JASMINE:    What?
ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN:    Then jump!

(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They
    try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)

GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we,
        street rat?

(Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are
    here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and
     throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)

GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy.
ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me!
JASMINE:    Let go of him.
GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we
        have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her
        down.)
JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak)
        Unhand him, by order of the princess.

(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)

GUARD:  Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN:    The princess?
ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess?
GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with
        this street rat?
JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release
        him!
GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from
        Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him.

(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)

JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I
        will.

(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He
    slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming
    in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside
    the door frame.)

JASMINE:    Jafar?
JAFAR:  Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO:       Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck!
JAFAR:  How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his
        cape, hiding the door.)
JASMINE:    The guards just took a boy from the market, on your
        orders.
JAFAR:  Your father's charged me with keeping peace in
        Agrabah.  The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE:    What was the crime?
IAGO:       I can't breathe, Jafar!
JAFAR:  Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
IAGO:       If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the
        door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!
JASMINE:    He didn't kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR:  (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear!  Oh, why
        frightfully upsetting.  Had I but known.
JASMINE:    What do you mean?
JAFAR:  Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried
        out.
JASMINE:    What sentence?
JAFAR:  (with a sinister tone)  Death.  (JASMINE gasps.)
        By beheading.
JASMINE:    No!  (She collapses to the floor.)
JAFAR:  I am exceedingly sorry, princess.
JASMINE:    How could you?  (She runs from the room crying.)

(IAGO finally makes it out through the door.  He flies up and lands on
    JAFAR's shoulder, coughing.)

IAGO:       So, how did  it go?
JAFAR:  I think she took it rather well.  (They both get a
        sinister smile on their faces.)

(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain.  RAJAH
    comes over to comfort her.  She pets him.)

JASMINE:    It's all my fault, Rajah.  I didn't even know his
        name.

(Cut to int. of dungeon.  Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see
    ALADDIN chained to the wall.)

ALADDIN:    (to himself) She was the princess.  I don't believe
        it.  I must have sounded so stupid to her.
ABU:        (from a distance) Yoo-hoo!  Aladdin? Hello!

(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!  Down here!  Hey, c'mon--help me outta these.

(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground.  He
     wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an
     imitation of the princess.)

ALADDIN:    Hey, she was in trouble.  Ah, she was worth it.

(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN's shoulders and pulls a small set of tools
    out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)

ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a
        street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's
        gotta marry a prince, she deserves it.

(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.)

ABU:        Ta da!
ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool
OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU
    have seen before.)

ALADDIN:    Who are you?
OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together,
        perhaps we can be more.
ALADDIN:    I'm listening.
OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled
        with treasures beyond your wildest dreams.
        Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd
        wager.

(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word
    'princess' as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation
     of "PRIN-cess."   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks
    his head out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.)

IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here!
ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry--
OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy?
        Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins,
        showing a hideously bad mouth.)
ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful
        treasure with me?
OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong
        back to go in after it.
ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here?

(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)

OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they
        seem.  So, do we have a deal?

(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)

ABU:        Oh, hmm.

(Cut to desert scene.  We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the
    OLD MAN and ABU on it.  Diss. to cave of wonders.)

CAVE:       Who disturbs my slumber?
ALADDIN:    It is I, Aladdin.
CAVE:       Proceed.  Touch nothing but the lamp.

(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of
    ALADDIN. )

OLD MAN:    Remember, boy--first fetch me the lamp, and then
        you shall have your reward.
ALADDIN:    C'mon, Abu.  (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of
        his vest.)

(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase.  He reaches the bottom
    and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)

ALADDIN:    Would ya look at that!
ABU:        Uh oh!
ALADDIN:    Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer
        than the sultan!

(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)

ALADDIN:    Abu!

(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)

ALADDIN:    Don't...touch...anything!  We gotta find that lamp.

(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises
    off the floor and begins following them.  ABU gets the feeling
    they're being followed.)

ABU:        Huh?

(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor.  He continues, and
    the CARPET begins to follow again.  Again, ABU turns back, but the
     CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU
     runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)

ABU:        Aladdin!  Aladdin!
ALADDIN:    Abu, will ya knock it off?

(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet
    jumps to the other side.  It reaches down with a tassel and pulls
    ABU's tail.  When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other
     side.  This time, ABU lands in a karate stance.  CARPET reaches
    down and plucks ABU's hat off, then puts it on himself.  ABU sits
    thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his
     face.  ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away.  ABU tackles
     ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, what are you--crazy?

(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)

ALADDIN:    A magic carpet!  C'mon.  C'mon out.  I'm not gonna
        hurt you.

(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU's hat and dusts
    it off.  It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to
     him.  ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN's shoulder.)

ALADDIN:    Take it easy, Abu.  He's not gonna bite.

(The CARPET again picks up ABU's hat and hands it to him.  ABU shakes
    his fist and screeches at it.  CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")

ALADDIN:    Hey, wait a minute.  Don't go.  Maybe you can help
        us.  (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies
        over and wraps around the pair.)  Hey, whoa!  You
        see, we're trying to find this lamp.  (CARPET
        motions for them to follow it.)  I think he knows
        where it is.

(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant
    underground cavern.  In the centre of the room is a tall pillar,
     with a staircase going up to it.  It is surrounded by water
     with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge.  At the top of
    the pillar is a beam of light.  ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)

ALADDIN:    Wait here!
ABU:        Oh.  Huh?

(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey.  The outstretched paws hold a
    giant ruby.  ABU is hypnotically drawn to it.   ALADDIN climbs the
     stairs quickly.  CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain
     to hold him back.  ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    This is it?  This is what we came all the way down
        here to--  (He looks down and sees ABU break free
        of CARPET's hold and lunge toward the jewel.)  Abu-
        NO!

(ABU grabs the jewel.  There is a rumbling and the room begins to
    shake.)

CAVE VOICE: Infidels!
ABU:            Uh oh!
CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure.  (ABU
               places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel
                and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you
                will never again see the light of day!

(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he
    skies down until he flies into the air.  The water has turned into
     lava.  He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears
    and catches him.   ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the
    bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava.
    Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock
     is exploding.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Carpet, let's move!

(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling
    debris.  ABU grabs ALADDIN's head and covers his eyes.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, this is no time to panic!  (He pulls ABU off
        his head and sees they are flying into a wall.)
        Start panicking.

(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave.  Finally, they
    emerge through the internal entrance.  Outside, the cave begins to
     growl and close.  CARPET and company are almost to the top when a
    boulder drops on carpet, sending it to the floor.  ALADDIN  grabs
    onto the rock wall and holds on.  He sees the OLD MAN at the top,
    within reach.)

ALADDIN:    Help me out!
OLD MAN:    Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN:    I can't hold on.  Give me your hand.
OLD MAN:    First give me the lamp!

(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.  He hands it up, a
    nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)

OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha!

(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD
     MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.)

ALADDIN:    What are you doing?
OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his
        normal voice.) Your eternal reward.

(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when
    ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN,
     who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as
     well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a
     boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races
     up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several
    times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one
    final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off
     his disguise.)

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't
        find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!!

(Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next
    to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)

SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong?
JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She
        looks as if she's been crying.)
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right.
        Now, tell me everything.

(Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET.
    ABU tries to wake him.)

ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin.

(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.)

ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.)
        We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the
        entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer)
        Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp.
ABU:        Aha!

(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)

ALADDIN:    Why, you hairy little thief!  Looks like such a
        beat-up, worthless piece of junk.  Hey, I think
        there's something written here, but it's hard to
        make out.

(He rubs the LAMP.  Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the
    LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the
    LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)

GENIE:  Aaaaahhhhh!  OY!  Ten-thousand years will give ya
        such a crick in the neck!  (He hangs ALADDIN on a
        nearby rock.  Then he pulls his head off and spins
        it around, yelling as he does so.  CARPET pulls a
        ALADDIN down.)  Whoa!  Does it feel good to be
        outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as
        a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and
        gentlemen.  Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in
        ALADDIN's face.)  What's your name?
ALADDIN:    Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIE:  (Says his name as if he's discovered something
        major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with
        ALADDIN's name on it, circled by chase lights.  The
        sign changes to reflect the GENIE's upcoming line.)
        Hello, Aladdin.  Nice to have you on the show.  Can
        we call you 'Al?' Or maybe just 'Din?'  Or how
        bout 'Laddi?'  (GENIE disappears, then a dog
        wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like 'Here, boy!
        C'mon, Laddi!'
ALADDIN:    (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder
        than I thought.
GENIE:  (Still a dog) Do you smoke?  Mind if I do? (Dog
        poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE.  ABU
        screeches wildly.)  Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I
        didn't singe the fur!  Hey, Rugman!  Haven't seen
        you in a few millennia!  Slap me some tassel!  Yo!
        Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE.
        GENIE looks at ALADDIN.)  Say, you're a lot smaller
        than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.)  Either
        that or I'm gettin' bigger.  Look at me from the
        side--do I look different to you?
ALADDIN:    Wait a minute!  I'm--your master?
GENIE:  (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN's hand and a
        mortarboard on his head.)  That's right!  He can
        be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as Arnold
        Schwarzenegger)  the ever impressive,(inside a
        cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with
        a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside)
        but never duplicated--

(He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.)

DUP. GENIES:    Duplicated, duplicated,  duplicated,
            duplicated,  duplicated,  duplicated,
            duplicated, duplicated, duplicated.
GENIE:  (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.)
        Genie!  Of!  The Lamp!  (Goes into Ed
        Sullivan)  Right here direct from the lamp, right
        here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment.
        Thank youuuuu!
ALADDIN:    Whoa!  Wish fulfillment?
GENIE:  Three wishes to be exact.  And ix-nay on the
        wishing for more wishes.  (Turns into a slot
        machine, arm pulls down and three GENIEs appear in
        the windows.)  That's it--three.  (Three GENIE
        caballeros come out of the slot.)  Uno, dos, tres.
        (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.)  No
        substitutions, exchanges or refunds.  (The duck
        drops with the secret word "Refunds.'
ALADDIN:    (To ABU) Now I know I'm dreaming.
GENIE:  (Music for "Friend Like Me" begins) Master, I don't
        think you quite realize what you've got here! So
        why don't you just ruminate, whilst I illuminate
        the possibilities.  (GENIE lights up like a
        fluorescent light)

    Well Ali Baba had them forty thieves
    Scheherazadie had a thousand tales
    But master you in luck 'cause up your sleeve
    You got a brand of magic never fails!

(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords.
    GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes
    the thieves into submission.)

    You got some power in your corner now
    Some heavy ammunition in your camp
    You got some punch, pizzazz, yahoo and how
    See all you gotta do is rub that lamp
    And I'll say

(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged
    by GENIE.  Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and
    explodes.  Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN's
     hand and rubs lamp with it.)

    Mister Aladdin sir
    What will your pleasure be?
    Let me take your order, jot it down
    You ain't never had a friend like me
    No no no!

(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a
    note pad, like a waiter. )

    Life is your restaurant
    And I'm your maitre' d!
    C'mon whisper what it is you want
    You ain't never had a friend like me.

(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal,
    but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes
     into four duplicate GENIEs.)

    Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service
    You're the boss, the king, the shah!
    Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish
    How about a little more Baklava?

(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN
    appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure
    and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the
    screen with baklava.)

    Try some of column 'A'
    Try all of column 'B'
    I'm in the mood to help you dude
    You ain't never had a friend like me

(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top,
    then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off
    and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth,
    and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE
     dressed like a magician comes out.)

(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant
    hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish
    him into nothing.)

    Can your friends do this?
    Do your friends do that?
    Do your friends pull this out their little hat
    Can your friends go poof!
    Well looky here
    Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip
    And then make the sucker disappear?

(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them.
    He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins
    one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses
     the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull
     himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around
     until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into
    a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center).
     The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS,
    who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them,
     they disappear.)

    So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed
    I'm here to answer all your midday prayers
    You got me bona fide, certified
    You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs!
    I got a powerful urge to help you out
    So what you wish I really want to know
    You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt
    So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh!


(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a
    certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls
     a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses
    to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)

    Mister Aladdin, sir, have a wish or two or three
    I'm on the job, you big nabob
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never had a friend, never had a friend
    You ain't never...had a... friend... like...me!
    You ain't never had a friend like me!

(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one.
     She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into
    existence.  To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels,
     and a grand finale dancing number ensues.  ABU grabs as much gold
     as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and
    zaps it away until they're all back in the cave.  GENIE has a
    neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and
    sees that is is empty.)

GENIE:  So what'll it be, master?
ALADDIN:    You're gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
GENIE:  (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost.  There are a
        few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos
ALADDIN:    Like?
GENIE:  Ah, rule number one: I can't kill anybody.  (He
        slices his head off with his finger.)  So don't
        ask.  Rule two: I can't make anyone fall in love
        with anyone else.  (Head turns into a big pair of
        lips which kiss ALADDIN.)  You little punim, there.
        (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a
        zombie.) Rule three: I can't bring people back from
        the dead.  It's not a pretty picture, (He grabs
        ALADDIN and shakes him) I don't like doing it!  (He
        poofs back to normal.)  Other than that, you got
        it!
ALADDIN:    (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos?  You
        mean limitations?  On wishes? (To ABU) Some all
        powerful genie--can't even bring people back from
        the dead. I don't know, Abu--he probably can't even
        get us out of this cave.  Looks like we're gonna
        have to find a way out of here--

(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of
    them.)

GENIE:  Excuse me?  Are you lookin' at
        me?  Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did
        you bring me here?  And all of a sudden, you're
        walkin' out on me?  (Gets madder and madder) I
        don't think so, not right now.  You're gettin' your
        wishes, so siddown!  (They all get on CARPET.
        GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of
        arms pointing out the exits.)  In case of
        emergency, the exits are here, here, here,
        here,here, here, here, here, here, here, here,
        here, anywhere!  Keep your hands and arms inside
        the carpet.  Weeee'rrrrrreee...outta here!

(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off
    into the distance.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. JAFAR is
    there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)

SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage.  If it weren't for all
        your years of loyal service... . From now on,
        you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,
        before they are beheaded.
JAFAR:  I assure you, your highness, it won't happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let's put this whole messy
        business behind us.  Please?
JAFAR:  My most abject and humblest apologies to you as
        well, princess.  (He takes her hand to kiss it, but
        she yanks it away.)
JASMINE:    At least some good will come of my being forced to
        marry.  When I am queen, I will have the
        power to get rid of you.
SULTAN: That's nice.  All settled, then.  Now, Jasmine,
        getting back to this suitor business, (he
        looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine?
        Jasmine!  (He runs after her.)
JAFAR:  If only I had gotten that lamp!
IAGO:       (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of
        you!  D'oh!  To think--we gotta keep kissing
        up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the
        rest of our lives...
JAFAR:  No, Iago.  Only until she finds a chump husband.
        Then she'll have us banished--or beheaded!
BOTH:       Eeewww!
IAGO:       (Has an idea) Oh!  Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!
        Jafar?  What if you were the chump husband?
JAFAR:  (He looks at IAGO in insult)  What?
IAGO:       Okay, you marry the princess,all right? Then, uh,
        you become sultan!
JAFAR:  Oh!Marry the shrew?  I become sultan.  The idea has
        merit!
IAGO:       Yes, merit! Yes!  And then we drop papa-in-law and
        the little woman off a cliff!  (Dive bombs into the
        floor)  Kersplat!
JAFAR:  Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!

(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is
    coming in for a landing.)

GENIE:  (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic
        Carpet for all your travel needs.  Don't stand
        until the rug has come to a complete stop.  (As
        ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by
        CARPET) Thank you.  Good bye, good bye!  Thank you!
        Good bye!  (Back to normal)  Well, now.  How about
        that, Mr.  doubting mustafa?
ALADDIN:    Oh, you sure showed me.  Now about my three wishes-
GENIE:  Dost mine ears deceive me?  Three? You are down by
        ONE, boy!
ALADDIN:    Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the
        cave.  You did that on your own.

(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops.  He turns into a
    sheep.)

GENIE:  Well, don't I feel just sheepish?  All right, you
        baaaaad boy,  but no more freebies.
ALADDIN:    Fair deal.  So, three wishes.  I want them to be
        good.  (To GENIE) What would you wish for?

(GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.)

GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in
        my case, ah, forget it.
ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me.
GENIE:  Freedom.
ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner?
GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig.
        (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic
        powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.)
        Itty bitty living space
ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible.
GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not
        have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do
        you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own
        master, such a thing would be greater than all the
        magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But
        what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real
        here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and
        smell the hummus
ALADDIN:    Why not?
GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master
        wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's
        happened.
ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free.
GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh
        huh, right.  Whoop!
ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in
        and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my
        first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you
        free.   (He holds out his hand)
GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.)
        O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a
        magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want
        most?
ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl--
GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a
        heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't
        make anybody fall in love, remember?
ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and...
GENIE:  Pretty?
ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and
        this hair, wow...and her smile.
GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.)
        Ami.  C'est l'amour.
ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd
        have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince?
GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh,
        chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a
        crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab?
        (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from
        "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I
        hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A
        dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu,
        Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at
        ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the
        words!
ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!
GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square
        shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes
        a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and
        vest combo is much too third century. These
        patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No!
        Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's
        measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is
        outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy
        macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it
        say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse
        me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to
        cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and
        he flies over.)
ABU:        Uh oh!
GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game
        show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with
        "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your
        grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than
        riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out,
        it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it
        opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He
        spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the
        GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his
        fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.)
        Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need?
        (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning
        ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57
        Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's
        a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail
        fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to
        normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!!
        (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns
        into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from
        under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk
        space, check this action out!

(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.
     The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU
     hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)

ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good.
GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but
        we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban,
        kid, cause we're gonna make you a star!

(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks
    begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys.
    (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN
    balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top,
     then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the
    pile collapses.)

JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with
        your daughter.
IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  "If the princess
        has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,
        then the sultan shall choose for her."
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to
        stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs
        away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker
        back.)  How could I choose someone she hates?
        (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a
        cracker in his mouth.)
JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the
        event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess
        must then be wed to...hmm...interesting.
SULTAN: What?  Who?
JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me!
SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can
        marry a princess, I'm quite sure.
JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my
        lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the
        SULTAN with it.)
SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures...
JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell
        breaks momentarily)...but you're so old!
JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry
        me!
SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again
        broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince
        Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha.
        Jafar., you must come and see this!

(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in
    human form as a MAJOR.)

MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali!
MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar,
    Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star,
    Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!
    Make way, here he comes,
    Ring bells, bang the drums.
    You're gonna love this guy

(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.)

    Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!
    Genuflect, show some respect
    Down on one knee

(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)

    Now try your best to stay calm
    Brush up your Sunday Salaam
    And come and meet his spectacular coterie.

(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him.  The
    MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU's trunk.  They stand
    on each other's shoulders as ALI shakes hands.)

    Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!
    Strong as ten regular men, definitely
    He faced the galloping hordes
    A hundred bad guys with swords
    Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali!

(The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt
    zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic
     wheel formation.  The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child
    and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)

CHORUS OF MEN:(Carrying the camels) He's got seventy-five golden camels!

(In pops a typical parade commentator)

HARRY:  Don't they look lovely, June?

CHORUS OF WOMEN:    (On a float)  Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three!

(In comes another commentator.)

JUNE:   Fabulous, Harry, I love the feathers!

GENIE:  (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon gorilla proceeds down
            the parade)
    When it comes to exotic type mammals
    Has he got a zoo, I'm telling you
    It's a world class menagerie!

(GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two
    lines to the two children from earlier.  We cut to a balcony,
    where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)

    GENIE:
        GIRLS: (in couterpoint)
    Prince Ali, Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa
        There's no question this Ali's alluring
    That physique, how can I speak
        Never ordinary, never boring
    Weak at the knee
        Everything about the man just plain impresses
    Well, get on out in that square
        He's a wonder, he's a whiz, a wonder
    Adjust your veil and prepare
        He's about to pull my heart asunder
    To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali!
        And I absolutely love the way he dresses!

(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She
    humphs it off, then leaves.)

CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys!
    (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!)
    And to view them, he charges no fee!
    (He's generous, so generous)
    He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies!
    (Proud to work for him)
    They bow to his whim, love serving him
    They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali!

(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to
    collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the
    palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door
    to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door.
    Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing
     JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)

GENIE:  Prince Ali!
    Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa
    Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!
    And that,good people, is why
    He got dolled up and dropped by
    With sixty elephants, llamas galore
    With his bears and lions
    A brass band and more
    With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
    His birds that warble on key
    Make way for Prince Ali!

(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back
    on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the
     door shut.)

SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.
ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have
            journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand.
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to
        meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.)
        This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted
        too.
JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince
        Abooboo--
ALADDIN:    --Ababwa!
JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited
        and expect to--
SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.
        (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his
        moustache.)  I don't suppose I might...
ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me.

(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down.
    JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)

JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this--
SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun.

(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who
    was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly
     bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and
    CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack,
     flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the
    background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.)

JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure.
        (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.)
JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.)
SULTAN: Look out, Polly!

(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their
    heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)

IAGO:       Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!

(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and
    crashes into a pillar.  He crashes to the floor, and his head
    is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker,
    have a cracker.  The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)

SULTAN: Out of the way, I'm coming in to land.  Jafar,
        watch this!  (He lands.)
JAFAR:  Spectacular, your highness.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely.  Yes, I do seem to have a knack for
        it.  (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then
        collapses.  ABU catches it.)  This is a very
        impressive youth. And a prince as well.   (Whispers
        to JAFAR) If we're lucky, you won't have to marry
        Jasmine after all.
JAFAR:  I don't trust him, sire.
SULTAN: Nonsense.  One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I'm
        an excellent judge of character.
IAGO:   Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure...not!!!

(JASMINE walks in quietly.)

SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!
ALADDIN:    And I'm pretty sure I'll like Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR:  Your highness, no.  I must intercede on Jasmine's
        behalf.  (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This
        boy is no different than the others.  What makes
        him think he is worthy of the princess?
ALADDIN:    Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks
        JAFAR's goatee, which springs out in all
        directions.)  Just let her meet me.  I will win
        your daughter!
JASMINE:    How dare you!  (They all look at her surprised.)
        All of you, standing around deciding my future?  I
        am not a prize to be won!  (She storms out.)
SULTAN: Oh, dear.  Don't worry, Prince Ali.  Just give
        Jasmine time to cool down.  (They exit.)
JAFAR:  I think it's time to say good bye to Prince
        Abooboo.

(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night.  We tilt down and find
    ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)

ALADDIN:    What am I going to do?  Jasmine won't even let me
        talk to her.  I should have known I couldn't pull
        off this stupid prince wish.  (ABU struggles with
        his elephant paws to open a banana.  He squishes
        it, and the banana squirts into his eye.  He then
        tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the
        same.)
GENIE:  (to carpet, playing chess) So move!  (CARPET does,
        knocking a black piece off the board.)  Hey.
        That's a good move.  (As Rodney Dangerfield) I
        can't believe it--I'm losing to a rug.
ALADDIN:    Genie, I need help.
GENIE:  (as Jack Nicholson) All right, sparky, here's the
        deal.  You wanna court the little lady, you gotta
        be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?
ALADDIN:    What?
GENIE:  (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points
        out his words on a blackboard)  Tell her
        the...TRUTH!!!
ALADDIN:    No way!  If Jasmine found out I was really some
        crummy street rat, she'd laugh at me. (He
        puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)
GENIE:  A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!
        (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.
        GENIE comes out holding the real turban.)  Al, all
        joking aside, you really oughtta be yourself.
ALADDIN:    Hey, that's the last thing I want to  be.  Okay,
        I'm gonna go see her.  I gotta be smooth, cool,
        confident.  How do I look?
GENIE:  (Sadly) Like a prince.

(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET.  JASMINE is on her bed,
    sighing.  RAJAH is by her side.)

ALADDIN:    (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?

(RAJAH looks up and growls.)

JASMINE:    Who's there?
ALADDIN:    It's me--Prince Ali.  Ahem--(Then he jumps to his
        deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.
JASMINE:    I do not want to see you.
ALADDIN:    No, no, please princess.  Give me a chance. (RAJAH
        growls and advances on him.)
JAFAR:  Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN:    Down kitty!

(Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)

GENIE:  How's our beau doing?

(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)

ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off
        his turban to brush RAJAH away.)
JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him
        before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you?
ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace.
ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.)
        I have servants that go to the marketplace for me.
        Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace
        for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you
        met.
JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not.
BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk
        about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes.
        Anything--pick a feature!
ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very...
BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
ALADDIN:    Punctual!
JASMINE:    Punctual?
BEE:        Sorry.
ALADDIN:    Beautiful.
BEE:        Nice recovery.
JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know.
ALADDIN:    Yeah!
JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan
ALADDIN:    I know.
JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry.
ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me.
BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt,
             swaggering, peacock I've met!
BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday!
              Mayday!
JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
ALADDIN:    What?
BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off!
BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into
             his turban)
ALADDIN:    Yeah, right!
JASMINE:    What!?!
ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be
        won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free
        to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look
        at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He
        steps up on the ledge and drops off.)
JASMINE:    No!
ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What?
JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that?
        (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet.
JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a
        tassel.)
ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you?
        We could get out of the palace, see the world.
JASMINE:    Is it safe?
ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me?
JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all-
        important line) What?
ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust
        me?
JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes.

(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky,
    knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole
     New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking
    up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace
     wall and into the sky.)

ALADDIN:    I can show you the world
    Shining, shimmering, splendid.
    Tell me princess, now when did you last
    Let your heart decide?

(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a
    flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE.
      She smiles.)

    I can open your eyes
    Take you wonder by wonder
    Over, sideways, and under
    On a magic carpet ride


(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.)

    A whole new world!
    A new fantastic point of view
    No one to tell us no
    Or where to go
    Or say we're only dreaming

(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET
    flies in and out of the clouds.)

JASMINE:    A whole new world
    A dazzling place I never knew
    But when I'm way up here
    It's crystal clear
    That now I'm in a whole new world with you!

ALADDIN:    Now I'm in a whole new world with you!

(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight.  It
    then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)

JASMINE:    Unbelievable sights
    Indescribable feeling
    Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
    Through an endless diamond sky

(They join a flock of birds in the sky.  One of them looks terrified
    and squawks.  CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting
    ALADDIN and JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them.  They then
    zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)

JASMINE:    A whole new world!
ALADDIN:    Don't you dare close your eyes
JASMINE:    An hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN:    Hold your breath--it gets better!
JASMINE:    I'm like a shooting star,
    I've come so far
    I can't go back to where I used to be!

(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the
     ship's sails are the Great Pyramids.  They wave at a worker
     sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx.  He smiles, but
    chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)

ALADDIN:    A whole new world!
JASMINE:    Every turn a surprise
ALADDIN:    With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE:    Every moment, red-letter

(They fly alongside wild horses running.  JASMINE pets one of them.)

BOTH:   I'll chase them anywhere
    There's time to spare
    Let me share this whole new world with you

    A whole new world
    That's where we'll be

(They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a
    tree and rolls it down his arm to JASMINE, who is now sure
    she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)

ALADDIN:    A thrilling chase
JASMINE:    A wondrous place
BOTH:       For you and me!

(CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of
    the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple
    at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)

JASMINE:    It's all so magical.
ALADDIN:    Yeah.
JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble)
        It's a shame Abu had to miss this.
ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up
        realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really
        like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)
        That is...oh no!
JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the
        market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me?
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry.
JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid?
ALADDIN:    No!
JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out?
ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not
        what I meant.
JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth!
ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,
        giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I
        sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the
        pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in
        defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on
         his turban falls down over his eyes.)
JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me?
ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the
        city in disguise, it sounds a little strange,
        don't you think?
JASMINE:    Not that strange.

(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a
    tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext.
    of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET
    forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends
     just below the balcony.)

JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince.
ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess.

(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they
    kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and
    looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)

ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends
        to the ground.) For the first time in my life,
        things are starting to go right.

(He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)

ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth.
        Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant
        hanging from a net tied in a tree.)
GUARD:  Hold him!

(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties
    CARPET in a knot around a tree.)

JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince
        Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's
        never found.

(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a
    cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water.
      He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock
     hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles
    out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he
    loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled
    by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes,
    and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)

GENIE:  Never fails.  Get in the bath and there's a rub at
        the lamp.  (Squeaks the duck)  Hello.  (Sees
        unconscious ALADDIN) Al?  Al!  Kid, snap out of it!
        You can't cheat on this one!  I can't help you
        unless you make a wish.  You have to say  "Genie I
        want you to save my life."  Got it?  Okay.  C'mon
        Aladdin!!  (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and
        shakes him.  His head goes up, then falls.)  I'll
        take that as a yes.  (Head turns into a siren.)
        Wooga!  Wooga!  (Turns into a submarine.)  Up
        scope!  (He babbles in something that sounds like
        German.  On the surface, a giant water spout
        emerges, and lands on top of the cliff.  ALADDIN
        reawakes and coughs the water out of his lungs.)
        Don't you scare me like that!
ALADDIN:    Genie, I--uh, I-uh...(He can't think of how to say
        it, so they just hug each other.)  Thanks, Genie.
GENIE:  Oh, Al.  I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.  Not
        that I want to pick out curtains or anything.

(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing
   her hair.  The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors,hypnotized.)

SULTAN: Jasmine!
JASMINE:    Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time.
        I'm so happy.
SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be,
        Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.
JASMINE:    What?
SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.)  You will
        wed Jafar.

(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)

JAFAR:  You're speechless, I see.  A fine quality in a
        wife.
JASMINE:    I will never marry you.  (She goes to the SULTAN)
        Father, I choose Prince Ali!
JAFAR:  Prince Ali left!

(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)

ALADDIN:    Better check your crystal ball  again, Jafar!
JASMINE:    Prince Ali!

(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)

IAGO:       How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
ALADDIN:    Tell them the truth, Jafar!  You tried to have me
        killed.
JAFAR:  What?  (He goes to the SULTAN)  Ridiculous
        nonsense, your highness.  He is obviously lying.
        (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN's face.)
SULTAN: Obviously...lying.

(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)

JASMINE:    Father, what's wrong with you?
ALADDIN:    I know!

(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches
    and the spell is broken for good.)

SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!
ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with
        this!  (He advances the staff)
SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor!

(The trio advances on JAFAR.)

JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained.
SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just
        dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead.

(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but
    is grabbed by guards.)

SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy!

(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes
    him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud
    appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)

SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere!
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right?
JASMINE:    Yes.

(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)

SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against
        me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever-
        (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.)
        Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You
        brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll
        leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once!
        Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and
        then my boy, you will be sultan!
ALADDIN:    Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a
        person of your unimpeachable moral character is
        exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks
        concerned at this.)

(Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.)

IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta
        start packing, your highness.  Only essentials.
        (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage.
        JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the
        guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out
        a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about
        this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a
        weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.)
        Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO
        flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar?
        Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around
        the neck) Good grip!
JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin
        Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago.
IAGO:       Why that miserable--
JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it!
IAGO:       Me?

(Cut to ext. of palace.  ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)

ALADDIN:    Sultan?  They want me to be sultan?

(GENIE comes out of lamp)

GENIE:  Huzzah!  Hail the conquering hero!  (Turns into a
        one-man band.  He sees ALADDIN walk away with his
        head hung.  He stops, scratches his head, comes up
        with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN.  He holds
        up his hands like a director scoping a picture and
        we look through them.)  Aladdin, you've just won
        the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do
        next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in
        sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs.
        GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls
        out a script labeled "Aladdin." Whispering: )
        Psst, your line is "I'm going to free the genie."
        Anytime.
ALADDIN:    Genie...I can't.
GENIE:  Sure you can.  You just go "Genie, I wish you
        free."  (He grabs ALADDIN's head and uses
        him as a mock ventriloquist's dummy.  ALADDIN pulls away.)
ALADDIN:    I'm serious.  Look, I'm sorry--I really am. But
        they want to make me sultan--no!, They want to make
        Prince Ali sultan.  Without you, I'm just Aladdin.
GENIE:  Al, you won!
ALADDIN:    Because of you!  The only reason anyone thinks I'm
        anything is because of you.  What if they find out
        I'm not really a prince?  (Quietly)  What if
        Jasmine finds out?  I'll lose her.  Genie, I can't
        keep this up on my own.  I can't wish you free.
GENIE:  (Sarcastically) Hey, I understand.  After all,
        you've lied to everyone else.  Hey, I was beginning
        to feel left out.  Now, if you'll excuse me,
        master. (He says the last word in disgust, then
        poofs back into the lamp.)

(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)

ABU:        Ohhh.
ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the
        spout and raspberries him.)   Well, fine. (He slams
        a pillow on top of the LAMP.)  Then just stay in
        there!  (He looks at ABU and CARPET.)  What are you
        guys looking at? (They both leave.) Look, I--I'm
        sorry.  Wait, Abu-- wait--I'm sorry, I didn't--
        wait, c'mon.  (He sighs.)  What am I doing?
        Genie's right--I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.
JASMINE:    (From a distance)  Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?
ALADDIN:    (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes.  (He walks
        into the garden.)  Jasmine?  Where are you?

(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO
    in the pond.  He is imitating JASMINE's voice.)

IAGO:       Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry.
ALADDIN:    I'm coming.

(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds.  IAGO laughs,
    then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is
    panting.)

FLAMINGO:   D'uh!
IAGO:       Ya got a problem, pinky?  (He sweeps the bird's
        feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace
        and finds the lamp under the pillow.)  Boy, Jafar's
        gonna be happy to see you!  (Stretches his face
        like JAFAR's and imitates it.)  Good work, Iago!
        (Normal) Ah, go on.  (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale
        of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,
        Jafar--you're too kind.  I'm embarrassed, I'm
        blushing.  (He flies away with the lamp.)

(Cut to the palace entrance.  The SULTAN is standing on top, making
    an announcement to the people.)

SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a
        suitor!

(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN
    appears at the bottom of the stairs.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine?
JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been?
ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you.
JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's
        announcement!
ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform
        with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire
        crowd.)
SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN:    Oh, boy!

(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)

IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
JAFAR:  Let them cheer.

 (He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.)

GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR)
        reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He
        descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the
        role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and
        sinister ugly man.
JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the
        ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.)
GENIE:  I was afraid of that.
JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on
        high, as sultan!!!

(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes.
    The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)

ALADDIN:    Whoa!
SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on?

(His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body
    flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer
     shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)

JAFAR:  Heh heh heh!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer.
IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls
        off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp!
JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo.

(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into
    the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him.
      They fly up near the GENIE's head.)

ALADDIN:    Genie!  No!
GENIE:  Sorry, kid--I got a new master now.  (He places the
        palace on top of a mountain.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!
JAFAR:  There's a new order now--my order!  Finally, you
        will bow to me!

(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)

JAFAR:  We'll never bow to you!
IAGO:       Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR:  If you will not bow before a sultan, then you will
        cower before a sorcerer!  (To GENIE)  Genie, my
        second wish--I wish to be the most powerful
        sorcerer in the world!

(GENIE extends his finger.  ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot,
    and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt  strikes JAFAR,
     returning him to his normal look.)

IAGO:       Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for
        Sorcerer Jafar!
JAFAR:  Now where were we?  Ah, yes--abject humiliation!
        (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and
        they both bow to him. RAJAH comes running at him.
        He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-
        cat.)  Down, boy!  Oh, princess--(lifts her chin
        with his staff)--there's someone I'm dying to
        introduce you to.
ALADDIN:    (off-camera) Jafar!  Get your hands off her!

(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN.  CARPET flies away.)

JAFAR:  Prince Ali
    Yes, it is he,
    But not as you know him.
    Read my lips and come to grips
    With reality

(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.)

    Yes, meet a blast from your past
    Whose lies were too good to last
    Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!

(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)

IAGO:       Or should we say Aladdin?
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I tried to tell you.

JAFAR:  So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin
    Just a con, need I go on?
    Take it from me
    His personality flaws
    Give me adequate cause
    To send him packing on a one-way trip
    So his prospects take a terminal dip
    His assets frozen, the venue chosen
    Is the ends of the earth, whoopee!
    So long,
IAGO:       Good bye, see ya!
JAFAR:  Ex-Prince Ali!

(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal.  He sends the two of them into
    a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before
    CARPET can get in.  F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where
    the pillar crashes and rolls.  It finally comes to a stop.
    ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)

ALADDIN:    Abu?  Abu!  (He looks back at a shivering pile of
        snow.)  Oh, this is all my fault--I should have
        freed the genie when I had the chance.  (He digs
        out ABU and cradles him inside his vest.)  Abu!
        Are you okay?  I'm sorry, Abu--I made a mess of
        everything, somehow.  I gotta go back and set
        things right.  (He starts to walk through the snow,
        and he eventuallysteps on a frozen CARPET.)
        Carpet!  (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by
        the pillar.  He tugs to try and free CARPET.  He
        can't do it, so he begins to remove snow from the
        base of the pillar.)   Abu, start digging!  That's
        it!  (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and
        the pillar begins to roll.  ALADDIN runs away,
        looks back, then slides into place.  The pillar
        rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and
        ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by
        the window of the pillar.)  Yeah!  All right!  (He
        looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU.
        CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick
        them up.)  Now, back to Agrabah!  Let's go!

(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds.
    Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN
    tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the
    throne.)

IAGO:       Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here's your cracker.
        Shove 'em all right down your throat.  Here, have
        lots!

(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)

JAFAR:  Leave him alone!

(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)

JAFAR:  It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine.
        (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.)
        A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be
        on the arm of the most powerful man in the world.
        (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do
        you say, my dear?  Why,  with you as my queen...

(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)

JASMINE:    Never!
JAFAR:  I'll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he
        raises his hand to slap her.  Then he stops.)  No.
        Genie, I have decided to make my final wish.  I
        wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in
        love with me.

(We see ALADDIN race back into town.)

GENIE:  (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few
        addendas, some quid pro quo-
JAFAR:  Don't talk back to me, you stupid blue lout!  You
        will do what I order you to do, slave!

(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to
    play along.)

JASMINE:    (She stands and puts the crown on her head.)
        Jafar!  I never realized how incredibly
        handsome you are.

(The GENIE's jaw drops.)

JAFAR:  That's better.  (He pulls the GENIE's jaw up like a
        shade.)  Now, pussycat, tell me more
        about...myself.
JASMINE:    You're tall, well dressed...

(JAFAR walks over to her.  ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE
    sees them.)

GENIE:  Al!  Al, little buddy!
ALADDIN:    Shh!
GENIE:  (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.)
        Al, I can't help you--I work for senor psychopath,
        now.  (His head turns into JAFAR's, then back.)
ALADDIN:    Hey--I'm a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE's
        mouth.)  I'll improvise.

(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE.
    JAFAR's back is to ALADDIN.)

JAFAR:  Go on.
JASMINE:    And your beard...is so...twisted!  (She has her
        arms around him.  She pretends to twist with her
        finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN
        to come over.  He makes his move.  IAGO sees him.)

IAGO:       Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
JAFAR:  And the street rat?
JASMINE:    What street rat?

(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl.  JAFAR
    turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him.  ALADDIN
     looks disgusted.  IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)

ABU:        Yuck!
JAFAR:  That was--(he sees ALADDIN's reflection in her
        crown.) You!!  How many times do I have
        to kill you, boy?

 (He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the
    ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)

ALADDIN:    Get the lamp!

(JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then
    zaps her into an hourglass.)

JAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!

(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine!
IAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)

(ABU rushes for the lamp.)

JAFAR:  Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey.
ALADDIN:    Abu!


(CARPET rushes in.)

JAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is
        zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the
        lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by
        large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs
        the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a
        sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed
        up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly
        snake?
JAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how
        snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we
        see a snake's tongue come out from behind his
        teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the
        ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the
        snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes
        moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN
        swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE
        cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.)

GENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into
        that snake!
JAFAR:  You stay out of thissss!

(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a 'J' on it.)

GENIE:  (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he's our man--if he can't do it,
        GREAT!

(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where
    JASMINE is trapped.  However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path.
     ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)

JASMINE:    Aladdin!

(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing
    the sword on his way.  He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake
    cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and
    hangs outside the palace.  ALADDIN jumps up on the snake's back
     and stabs it.  JAFAR screams in agony.  ALADDIN again tries to
     free the princess.)

ALADDIN:    Hang on, Jasmine!

(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)

JAFAR:  (laughs hideously)  You little fool!  You thought
        you could defeat the most powerful being on earth!
IAGO:       (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him,
        Jafar--Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him
        out of the way)
JAFAR:  Without the genie, boy, you're nothing!
ALADDIN:    (Has an idea)  The genie!  The genie!  The genie
        has more power than you'll ever have!
JAFAR:  What!!
ALADDIN:    He gave you your power, he can take it away!
GENIE:  Al, what are you doing?  Why are you bringing me
        into this?
ALADDIN:    Face it, Jafar--you're still just second best!
JAFAR:  You're right!  His power does exceed my own!  But
        not for long!

(JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)

GENIE:  The boy is crazy.  He's a little punch drunk.  One
        too many hits with the snake  (His hand
        turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
JAFAR:  Slave, I make my third wish!  I wish to be an all
        powerful genie!
GENIE:  (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command.
        Way to go, Al.

(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt.
    JAFAR's snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie.  We
     see JASMINE's raised hand disappear under the sand.  ALADDIN
    runs over and finally smashes the glass.  Sand and princess
     pour out.)

JAFAR:  Yes!  Yes!  The power! The absolute power!
JASMINE:    (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN:    Trust me!

(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.)

JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control!
ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something?
    (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you
    got it!  And everything that goes with it!

(Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.)

JAFAR:  No!  No!
IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the
        genie, I don't want--

(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)

ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space.
GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you!

(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN
    and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of
     the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed
     because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears
     where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the
    new lamp.)

JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak
        out of my face!
IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron!
JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up!
GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the
        balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He
        winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his
        palm flat and flicks it out into the desert
        with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of
        wonders ought to chill him out!

(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks
    over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.)

ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a
        prince.
JASMINE:    I know why you did.
ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes
        his head around the corner shocked at what he is
        hearing.)
JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you.
GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still
        got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a
        prince again.
ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom?
GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is
        love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're
        not gonna find another girl like her in a million
        years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked.
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop
        pretending to be something I'm not.
JASMINE:    I understand.

(They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns
    to the GENIE.)

ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for your freedom.
GENIE:  One bona fide prince pedigree coming up.  I--what?
ALADDIN:    (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.)  Genie, you're
        free!

(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off
    GENIE's wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground.
     GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)

GENIE:  (He can't believe it.)  Heh, heh!  I'm free. I'm
        free.  (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.)  Quick,
        quick, wish for something outrageous.  Say  "I want
        the Nile."   Wish for the Nile.  Try that!
ALADDIN:    I wish for the Nile.
GENIE:  No way!!  (Laughs hysterically.  He bounces around
        the balcony like a pinball.)  Oh does that feel
        good!  I'm free!  I'm free at last!  I'm hittin'
        the road.  I'm off to see the world!  I--

(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking
    very sad.)

ALADDIN:    Genie, I'm--I'm gonna miss you.
GENIE:  Me too, Al.  No matter what anybody says, you'll
        always be a prince to me.

(They hug.  The SULTAN steps forward.)

SULTAN: That's right.  You've certainly proven your worth
        as far as I'm concerned. It's that law that's the
        problem.
JASMINE:    Father?
SULTAN: Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?  From this day
        forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems
        worthy.
JASMINE:    (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN's arms.)
        Him!  I choose...I choose you, Aladdin.
ALADDIN:    Ha, ha.  Call me Al.

(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together.
    GENIE is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy
     hat.)

GENIE:  Oh, all of ya. Come over here.  Big group hug!
        Mind if I kiss the monkey?  (He kisses ABU.)  Ooh,
        hairball!  Well, I can't do any more damage around
        this popsicle stand.  I'm outta here!  Bye, bye,
        you two crazy lovebirds.  Hey, Rugman: ciao!  I'm
        history!   No, I'm mythology!  No, I don't care
        what I am--I'm free!

(The GENIE flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles
    behind him.  They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse)
     to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see
     ALADDIN and JASMINE flying on CARPET.)

ALADDIN:    A whole new world
JASMINE:        A whole new life
BOTH:   (with off-camera chorus)    For you and me!
MEN'S CHORUS:   A whole new world!

(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared,
    the moon turns and reveals the GENIE's laughing face.  Suddenly
    the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up
     and looks at the audience.)

GENIE:  Made ya look!

(Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon.  Fade to black.
    The end.)

          TNT. KITCHEN - DAY
          A New York Times crossword puzzle. The hand of MARY HOROWITZ
          scratches the answers in ink without pausing even a second
          between each one.

          MARY (V.O.)
          Vita aenigma est. Life is a
          puzzle. It is. Specifically, life
          is most like a crossword puzzle.
          There are a million reasons why,
          not the least of which is that
          life, like crosswords, requires the
          use of your whole entire brain-
          Her writing hand knocks a glass of grape soda and it spills
          all over the puzzle.

                         MARY
          Crap.
          The puzzle answers all run together.

          INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

          Ten plastic folding chairs line the hallway -- all empty
          except for one.
          In the last chair sits Mary Horowitz, 31, in her best
          synthetic cardigan, somebody's grandmother's skirt, her own
          red rubber boots. Genius meets retard. She mumbles to
          herself.

                         MARY
          Four letter word for... vomit.
          She takes a deep breath to calm her nerves. it doesn't help.

                         MARY
          Not "barf". For sure not "barf".
          That's too easy. "Puke" is okay,
          but maybe a bit pedestrian (that
          means boring)... I like "hurl". I
          do. I like the way it rolls off
          your tongue -- the word, I mean.
          But my all time favorite is none of
          those.
          She puts her head between her knees, tries to keep it
          together.

          

          

          

          

          2.

                         MARY
          Four letter word for vomit? S-P-E-
          W. Spew... Sp-ew.
          A door nearby opens but Mary doesn't budge. A POLICE OFFICER
          walks out.
          A 40ish female TEACHER pokes her head out the door, signals
          to Mary.

                         TEACHER
          We're ready for you now.
          (a plastic Kroger shopping
          Mary jumps up, grabs her purse
          bag).

                         MARY
          Jesus help me.

          INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

          Mary stands in front of the chalkboard, "CAREER DAY" written
          in huge letters behind her. She smiles with terror at the
          class of 10 year old KIDS.
          The Teacher reads from her notes.

                         TEACHER
          Here's a treat, students. Our
          final guest for Career Day, Miss
          Mary Horowitz, is the crossword
          constructor for the Atlanta
          Citizen. You know the crossword
          puzzles you see every week in the
          newspaper? It's her job to create
          them. Isn't that fun?
          Mary stares at the Teacher, whispers.

                         MARY
          You weren't supposed to tell them.

                         TEACHER
          Pardon me?

                         MARY
          I made a crossword puzzle to help
          them guess what my job is. You
          ruined it.

                         TEACHER
          Oh, I'm so sorry.

          

          

          

          

          3.
          Mary takes the crossword puzzles out of her bag, looks at
          them like lost puppies.

                         TEACHER
          Maybe you could tell them a bit
          about what your job is like?

                         MARY
          People do crossword puzzles all the
          time but they don't often think of
          the person who made all the words
          fit together, and who thought up
          the clues, and who made sure the
          little black squares at the top
          mirror the ones at the bottom.
          She pulls one of the crosswords out of the garbage can, holds
          it up, turns it upside down, forces a nervous smile.

                         MARY
          Crossword constructors usually have
          above average intelligence, with
          knowledge of just about every
          subject you can imagine. And it
          helps if they can spell.
          The card in Mary's hand reads "LAUGH". She laughs. Nobody
          else does. She looks at the cards again, instantly gets
          serious, sweeps her hand through the air.

                         MARY
          Imagine, for a moment, a world
          without crossword puzzles. A world-
          Mary notices one Kid with his hand up. It totally throws her
          off.

                         TEACHER
          Daniel, you have a question?

                         DANIEL
          You make a living doing that? Just
          making puzzles? The Atlanta
          Citizen only comes out on Fridays.
          One puzzle a week can't make you
          enough to live on.
          A LARGE KID in the front row pipes up.

          

          

          

          

          4.

          LARGE KID
          How do you pay your rent?

                         MARY
          My parents -

                         DANIEL
          You live with your parents?
          The Kids all laugh their asses off. Mary just stares at
          them.

          LARGE KID
          Oh my God, how old are you? Still
          living at home!
          The kids all laugh some more. Mary's on the verge of panic.

                         TEACHER
          Children!
          The Teacher shoots the Kids a warning look, then notices Mary
          hyperventilating.

                         TEACHER
          Are you okay?
          Mary grasps for breath, struggles to speak.

                         MARY
          Water.

                         TEACHER
          Water. Just hang on.
          The Teacher rushes out. The kids all stare at Mary.

                         MARY
          Yep, I live at home...
          She forces herself to get it together, totally faking it.

                         MARY
          But so do all of you, so there...
          And sure, I only create one
          crossword puzzle a week but I have
          deadlines, I have stress, I have
          demands on me so huge you would not
          believe. The newspaper business is
          hell. I mean it. Hell.
          Somebody's got to write about all
          the horrors that go on in this
          world.

                         (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          5.
          MARY (cont'd)
          And after people read about those
          horrors, somebody else has to bring
          them back from the brink of
          suicide. Who do you think that is?
          She leans in close to the front row, scares herself more than
          anybody.

                         MARY
          Me! My crossword puzzle is always
          good news. it enlightens.
          it r andma's
          entertains. It keeps your g
          mind alive so she remembers to send
          you five bucks on your birthday.
          Think about that as you lie in bed
          tonight picking your nose and crying
          yourself to sleep. I know I will.
          The Kids just stare at her. She leans against the teacher's
          desk, tries to look relaxed but fails miserably.

                         MARY
          My job matters, you know. In media
          circles I am, as the Dutch say,
          geliefd. That means I have plenty
          of friends. Hoards, in fact.
          Scads even.
          The kids aren't buying it.

          LARGE KID
          You're a freak.
          The kids all nod in agreement. Mary's frozen, devastated.
          The Teacher rushes back into the room with a cup of water,
          hands it over. Mary sips it like communion wine. Half of it
          runs down her chin.
          Mary looks at the Teacher, fakes a smile.

                         MARY
          That's a pretty blouse.
          The Teacher smiles back. Awkward.

          EXT. SCHOOL -- DAY

          The front doors of the school swing open and a visibly shaken
          Mary walks out. She takes a deep breath and embraces denial.

          

          

          

          

          6.

                         MARY
          Twelve letter phrase for smashing
          success!
          She heads down the walkway toward the bus stop.

                         MARY
          As one would say in old Paris...
          Coup de maitre!
           A CUSTODIAN cleaning the school yard looks up. Mary keeps on
          talking - now to him.

                         MARY
          It means "master stroke", even
          though the direct translation is
          actually "master blow"... Leave it
          to the French to pass off an
          unpleasant slave activity as an
          everyday expression.
          The Custodian doesn't know what the hell she's talking about.
          Mary continues on to the bus stop.

          INT. CITY BUS -- DAY

           The CITY BUS DRIVER watches as Mary pays her $1.75 one nickel
          at a time.

                         MARY
          I sometimes suffer from benign
          positional vertigo. Could you
          please not drive until I'm -
          f He ignores her, starts driving. Mary struggles toward the
          back o f the bus, grabbing g
          goes.

                         MARY
          Excuse me... pardonnez-moi...
          begnadiyen sie mich...
          She lurches for an empty seat and just about dislodges her
          shoulder on the center pole. Finally settled, she peeks
          under her sweater at the shoulder damage.

                         MARY
          Hello hematoma.
          She smiles at an angry ELDERLY LADY sitting across from her.
          The lady gives her the "don't talk to me" glare, then stares
          out the window. Mary fidgets in her seat.

          

          

          

          

          7.

          MARY (V.O.)
          In crosswords, as in life, some
          days are harder than others. It's
          true. In the New York Times, for
          example, the puzzles get harder as
          the week goes. So on Monday, a day
          that traditionally bites the big
          one, the crossword is super easy.
          It's comforting to know that
          although life can be difficult at
          times, crosswords let you off easy
          when you need it the most.
          Mary looks around for anybody to talk to. The other
          PASSENGERS avert their eyes. Mary starts biting her nails.

           EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

          A frail 80 year old man MR. TAKIHASHI works alongside his
          wspapers,
          40ish granddaughter BETTY selling magazines, ne
          smokes and Pocky.
          In the corner of the newsstand, a muted TV features CNN
          "Breaking News" coverage of a high speed car chase.
          BUSINESSMEN are glued to the images as they wait in line.
          Mary grabs a half a dozen different newspapers, yells to Mr.
          Takihashi like he's deaf.

                         MARY

          KONCHA, TAKIHASHI-SAN!
          He ignores her. Mary hands the papers to Betty.

                         MARY
          Hi Betty.
          Betty just rings up the papers.

                         MARY
          Did you see the review of
          "Hairspray" in the Journal
          yesterday? They used the word
          "spectacular" -- always a good
          sign. Maybe you'd like to go see
          it with rne? I have a coupon for
          five dollars off.
          Betty shoves the newspapers back across the counter, points
          at them, then speaks in barely recognizable English.

          

          

          

          

          S.

                         BETTY
          Nine dollar twenty.
          Mary fishes in her bag for money.

                         MARY
          We could bring your dad if you
          want. I don't think the show is
          ageist. That means he won't feel
          like a loser for being old.
          As she takes her time paying, Mr. Takihashi madly gestures
          about Mary holding up the line. Betty barks at her.

                         BETTY
          Pecha kucha! Do Itta!
          Betty takes Mary's money, waves her on and helps the next
          customer.

                         MARY
          So no then? That's a no?
          Betty ignores her. Mary waits, loads the newspapers into her
          bag.

          MARY (V.O.)
          Sometimes crosswords are even
          better than life. Here's how.
          They don't discriminate.
          Crosswords don't care if you're
          young or old; black or white; male,
          female or intersex. Crosswords
          only care if you're an idiot. And,
          really, that's okay, because if you
          have the IQ of a yam, finishing a
          crossword should be the least of
          your worries.
          Mary glances up at the TV news once more, then walks away.

          INT. CNN LOADING BAY - DAY

          A half dozen NEWS CREWS rush to load and unload CNN news ECHS --
          vans. JOURNALISTS, PHOTOGRAPHERS,
          PRODUCERS, SOUNDyT
          all in a mad rush to go get
          An unshaven and surprisingly calm STEVE balances camera
          equipment in one hand while he scratches a barely legible
          "Steve" onto a clipboard. A young PA takes the clipboard,
          hands Steve a bunch of gas masks.

          

          

          

          

          9.

                         50'S
          Steve heads to an open van where a disheveled, mid
          producer ANGUS MCCORMACK checks his watch.

                         ANGUS
          Where the hell is he?

                         STEVE
          Probably doing his nails.
           -- paper
          40ish reporter HARTMAN HUGHES rushes to the van on his face.
          napkin tucked in his shirt collar, bread crumbs

                         HARTMAN
          What do you mean "the big one"?
          Terrorists, natural disaster, what?

                         ANGUS
          Pandemic.
          Hartman's eyes light up.

                         ANGUS
          Half of the Midwest and spreading.
          Nobody's safe.
          Steve tries on a gas mask.

                         HARTMAN
          Please let it be the bird flu.

                         STEVE
          Bird flu is for pussies. This
          thing's unstoppable.

                         HARTMAN
          How's it spreading?
          Angus looks at Steve.

                         STEVE
          Squirrels.
          Hartman can barely contain his excitement.

                         HARTMAN
          Oh my God, they're everywhere!

                         STEVE
          Exactly.

                         HARTMAN
          Al Qaeda connection?

          

          

          

          

          10.

                         ANGUS
          Always a possibility.

                         STEVE
          Who wishes he was in Iraq now?

                         HARTMAN
          Not me!.
          Hartman grabs a gas mask and rushes to the van's side mirror.

                         HARTMAN
          I need blush. No, wait. I'll go
          pasty. It'll look like I could be
          the first media victim. "Hartman
          Hughes, no such thing as too close
          to the story".
          Hartman looks back at Steve and Angus. They're just standing
          there, unable to keep a straight face. Hartman deflates.

                         HARTMAN
          Assholes! I knew it was too good
          to be true.
          He throws his gas mask down, storms off.

                         ANGUS
          Hartman, come on.
          Hartman gets in the elevator, hollers out to them.

                         HARTMAN
          I had a perfectly good bologna
          sandwich going on upstairs.
          Wasted!
          Angus and Steve watch the elevator door close, shrug it off.

                         STEVE
          Next E-coli story breaks, he'll be
          fine.

          EXT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY

          An 1890 Colonial Revival home surrounded by White Oaks.
          Oversized statue of the Blessed Virgin in the flower bed.
          Mezuzah on the door.
          Face still in the newspaper, Mary trips up the steps and
          skids onto the porch. Her knee starts to bleed.

          

          

          

          

          11.

                         MARY
          Crap.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY

           It's house that's been lived in. Every inch cluttered with
           old newspapers, family photos, various objet d'art, and
          books, books and more books.
           Mary steps out of her boots and marches into the living room
          where her 50ish mother, MRS. HOROWITZ, sits reading with MR.
          HOROWITZ (late 50's, professorial head to toe, furrowed brow
          to worn loafers).

                         MARY
          "Brilliant" is what they said.
          Never in the history of St.
          Margaret's Career Day have the
          children's brains been so
          inordinately stimulated as they
          were today by my presentation.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Good for you, sweetie.
          Mary pulls the newspapers out of her bag, sorts through them,
          stacks them on top of the TV.

                         MARY
          "Inspired", the teacher told me.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          You get the Post?
          She hands him the paper.

                         MARY
          "Engrossing" one child exclaimed.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          A ten year old said that?

                         MARY
          I'm sure that's what he meant. And
          "ebullient"-

          MR. HOROWITZ
          What happened to your knee?
          Mary looks down at the blood dripping down from her knee onto
          her sock. She's completely annoyed - more at the question
          than the mess.

          

          

          

          

          12.

                         MARY
          Dad, some of the greatest orators
          of all time had their heads chopped
          off for their labors. I'm lucky to
          escape with a simple flesh wound.
          Mary hands over the last newspaper, heads out to the hallway.
          Her mother yells to her.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Change those socks before your
          date.

                         MARY
          I told you I'm not going.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Mrs. Alchessi says you'll like this
          one.

                         MARY
          Mrs. Alchessi has gliomatosis
          cerebri.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          What?

                         MARY
          A brain tumor characterized by,
          among other things, dementia.
          She's nuts.
          Mary walks up the stairs.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Mary, it's just a date. This is
          what normal girls your age do.
          Mary stops on the stairs.

                         MARY
          I'm normal.
          Silence from her parents. Mary marches back into the living
          room.

                         MARY
          In fact, I'm normalis extremes.
          That's the kind of normal that
          doesn't get more normal.

          MRS. HANCOCK
          Of course you are, sweetie.

          

          

          

          

          13.
          Mary looks at her obviously lying mother and uncomfortable
          father. Mary's mind reels, like her head is going to
          explode. Finally, a determination hits her.

                         MARY
          I'll go.
          Mary bolts up the stairs to her room.
          Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz look at each other, surprised, happy.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          You ever want to see grandchildren,
          you better burn the damn boots.
          She swats him with her book, tries not to laugh.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Storage room or bedroom? Boxes and books all over the place.
           In the middle of it all, a bed.
           On the dresser, a bunch of photos of Mary Tyler Moore in the - MTM in a
          1970's. Taped to the mirror, the chosen photo Horowitz
           smart blue sweater and skirt ensemble. An
           wears the exact same outfit. Oddly,
           surprisingly current and actually hot.
           She leans over the gerbil cage next to her desk, taps to wake
          up the :Lone, fat occupant.

                         MARY
          Carol, tonight I have a date. A
          blind one. Not the guy, I mean the
          situation. We are, as yet, unknown
          to one another... It's nerve
          wracking, I know. Try not to have
          a spontaneous epileptiform seizure.
          The doorbell rings. Mary freezes, listens for the muffled
          voices downstairs.
          She sits on the corner of her bed and breathes rapidly into a
          paper bag.
          There's a knock on her bedroom door. Mary folds up the bag,
          puts it in her pocket for later, then opens the door a crack.
          It's her mother.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Guess who's here.

          

          

          

          

          14.

                         MARY
          I'd rather not.
          Mrs. Horowitz opens the door wider, takes a look at Mary,
          looks like she's going to cry.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Look at you.

                         MARY
          i already did. Repeatedly.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          You're beautiful.

                         MARY
          Please don't mean on the inside.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Beautiful and smart. And fun. And
          interesting.
          Mary takes a deep breath, lets it out fast.

                         MARY
          Let's hope all that does it for
          him.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          A bored, CNN jacket wearing Steve looks up to see Mrs.
          Horowitz descending the stairs. Not far behind, Mary takes
          each step like her knees are fused together but still manages
          to look hot. Steve's pleasantly surprised.
          With one look at Steve, Mary's eyes glaze over as if a choir
          is screaming "hallelujah" in her brain.
          As Mary reaches the bottom step --

                         STEVE
          Mary, hi. I'm Steve.
          She puts up a finger - "just a second".
          She turns around and runs back upstairs. Steve looks at Mrs.
          Horowitz, confused.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          And how's your mother?

          

          

          

          

          15.

                         STEVE
          Great. Thanks.
          She just stares at him and smiles.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Mary runs into her room, kneels down in front of the mizrach
          and crucifix on the wall. Hands clasped in prayer.

                         MARY
          Gods. You may have noticed that
          I'm wearing clean socks.
          Translation: I'm really trying and
          thus should be amply rewarded.
          Thanks for your support.
          She gets up, has a second thought, gets back onto her knees.

                         MARY
          And by support I don't mean, you
          know -
          She hikes up her bra.

                         MARY
          I mean your assistance, your
          furtherance, your advocacy of my
          efforts to get out there and... do
          what I'm supposed to do.
          She concentrates hard, opens her eyes. Now she's ready.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Steve waits as Mary walks down the stairs again, this time a
          bit more relaxed.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          There we go.
          Mary makes it to the bottom of the stairs, steps into her red
          boots. Her mother cringes. Steve's a bit surprised at the
          boots but who cares, Mary's still hot from the knee caps up.

                         STEVE
          Ready?
          Mary nods a bunch of times.

          

          

          

          

          16.

                         STEVE
          Mrs. Horowitz. Goodnight.
          (calling into living room)
          Sir.

          MR. HOROWITZ (O.S.)
          You kids have fun.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Be careful now. Don't forget your
          seatbelts.
          Mrs. Horowitz sees them out the door then heads into the
          living room. She waves to them out the window, trying to
          hide her worry but failing miserably.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          She'll be fine.
          They look at each other - a bit of hope, a bit of dread.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Steve unlocks the driver's side door of his SUV while Mary
          waits at her door, nervous but smiling.

                         STEVE
          Sorry about this blind date thing.
          My mother -

                         MARY
          I never went to kindergarten!
          He looks at her, totally confused.

                         MARY
          They skipped me to the forth grade.

                         STEVE
          Okay.
          She gets in the car, fastens her seatbelt. Steve hesitates
          then heads to the driver's side, gets in.

                         MARY
          I missed finger painting.
          He has no clue what to say.

                         STEVE
          Sorry?

          

          

          

          

          17.

                         MARY
          Me too.
          She lunges for his lips but the seatbelt snaps her back
          inches short.

                         STEVE
          Whoa!
          Undeterred by the whiplash, Mary undoes her seatbelt and
          tries again, this time making contact with Steve's lips.
          He's more than a little startled but kisses her back anyway,
          all the while straining to see the Horowitz house.

                         STEVE
          Mary... uh, what about your mother?
          She straddles him and keeps kissing.

                         MARY
          You're not her type. And she's
          married.

                         STEVE
          No, we're right in front of your
          house and...
          She undoes her sweater.

                         STEVE
          And I have no problem with that
          whatsoever.
          She kisses his neck. He looks up with a "thank you, God".

                         MARY
          Steve?

                         STEVE
          Mary.

                         MARY
          Is it Steven with a V or Stephen
          with a P-H?

                         STEVE

          V.
          She works over his face over like it's an ice cream cone.

          

          

          

          

          18.

                         MARY
          I thought so. There are almost a
          million Stevens with a V in the
          country, you know. It's much more
          popular than the P-H way, almost
          twice as popular in fact. I think
          it's the Brits who prefer the P-H.
          They love their P-H's over there.
          Not as much as they love their fish
          and chips but still, they love
          them. It was the media thing, you
          know, that's why our moms wanted us
          to get together. You work in the
          media, so do I. We really have to
          hand it to our moms, Steve, we do,
          and not just for raising us, or for
          thriving during a time when women
          painstakingly struggled for
          equality, but I mean we should hand
          it to them for being visionaries
          and predicting our all encompassing
          compatibility. We're
          professionally compatible, yes, but
          it's occurring to me at this
          particular moment that we're also
          sexually compatible, and I don't
          know if you noticed like I noticed
          but we're also both wearing blue.
          What are the chances of that?
          Actually, if I really think about
          it, the chances are probably pretty
          good. Blue is one of the most
          popular three colors, however,
          yours is-
          She leans forward and checks the fabric tag on the neck of
          his jacket. She can't quite read it. She reaches up and
          flips on the interior light. Steve's just about blinded.
          She grabs the tag, reads.

                         MARY
          Nylon. And mine...
          She grabs her own tag and reads it, just about elbowing Steve
          in the eye.

                         MARY
          Polyester! See? Both synthetic
          fibres! And the chances of that
          are much smaller than the chances
          of us just wearing blue.
          Steve looks at Mary - suddenly fully aware of her craziness.

          

          

          

          

          19.

                         MARY
          Do you like crosswords?

                         STEVE
          Sure.
          She just about jumps out of her pants with excitement.

                         MARY
          Me too! And semantics, the study
          of the meaning of words? You love
          words, right?

                         STEVE
          What's not to love.

                         MARY
          I know!
          She can hardly believe her good fortune. Her mind reels just
          as fast as her lips.

                         MARY
          Steve with a V, you know what we
          are? We're didymous. Two of a
          kind. Two rare earth elements
          brought together by Norns, that's
          Scandinavian for The Destinies.
          You want to make out for ten to
          fifteen minutes more then go get a
          six pack of Twinkies and Mountain
          Dew and stay up all night and talk?
          Steve is frozen. No escape - then it hits him. He jumps a
          bit, pulls out his cell phone.

                         STEVE
          Sorry. I have to get this.

                         MARY
          I didn't hear it ring.

                         STEVE
          Vibrate.

                         MARY
          I didn't feel it

                         STEVE
          You didn't?
          (into phone)
          This is Steve... What? Really?
          Now? If I don't have a choice...

          

          

          

          

          20.
          He hangs up, looks at Mary like he feels bad.

                         STEVE
          Work. I have to go to... Boston.
          This happens all the time. You
          know how it is. Wherever news
          happens...
          Mary gets off of him, slides back into her seat, buttons her
          sweater.

                         MARY
          It's okay. When you get back we
          can have plenty of quality time.

                         STEVE
          Sure. I'll call you.
          He leans over, opens her door.

                         MARY
          Steve, this has been a night to
          remember.

                         STEVE
          No kidding. You certainly are -
          He searches for any word that will do. Mary jumps in.

                         MARY
          Normal.

                         STEVE
          You read my mind.
          Never happier, she jumps out of the car.
          As he drives away, she pulls the paper bag out of her pocket,
          breathes into it.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - NIGHT

          Mary's parents hear the door open then Mary's footsteps hit
          the stairs. Mrs. Horowitz jumps up, rushes to meet her.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Sweetie, what's wrong? What
          happened? My God, you've barely
          been gone ten minutes.
          Mary stops on the stairs, turns back.

          

          

          

          

          21.

                         MARY
          Mom, sometimes that's all you need
          to know he's the one!
          Mary smiles big, takes the rest of the stairs up two at a
          time. Mrs. Horowitz is about to follow her.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          That girl makes up her mind the
          moon is green, it's green. Leave
          her be. It'll pass. Eventually.
          Mrs. Horowitz moves away from the stairs, no less worried.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

          Mary leaps from the doorway and lands on her bed in pencil
          pose, smiling up at the ceiling.

                         MARY
          Eleven letter word for serendipity.
          She screams into her pillow.

                         MARY
          The perfect answer: S-E-R-E-N-D-I-P-
          I-T-Y. Serendipity. Why would you
          ever need a better word than that?
          She sits up, grabs her notebook, starts to draw out a new
          crossword puzzle.

          - DAY

          INT. ATLANTA CITIZEN NEWSPAPER OFFICES

          A busy newspaper office. COURIERS make deliveries,
          JOURNALISTS talk at their desks, SECRETARIES count the
          minutes until they can go home.
          In the Editor's office, JIM SOLOMAN looks over the newspaper
          layout with an ASSISTANT.

                         SOLOMAN
          Let's split the gardening feature
          into two weeks. Keep them in
          suspense.
          He steps back, looks at the whole layout.

                         SOLOMAN
          Looks good. How are we doing here?

          

          

          

          

          22.
          He checks his watch.

                         SOLOMAN
          Five minutes to spare. Look at
          that.
          The Assistant points to a blank corner of page 26. Soloman's
          surprised, and not particularly impressed.

                         SOLOMAN
          Horowitz.

          INT. ATLANTA CITIZEN BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

          Mary stands at the front of the full elevator, smiling, a
          piece of paper gripped in her hand.

          MARY (V.0.)
          When I was a fledgling (that means
          novice) crossword constructor, I
          would find comfort in the words of
          the learned crossword sages. Above
          all, my hero is Manny Nosowsky,
          frequent New York Times contributor
          and all around cruciverbial master.

          INT. ATLANTA CITIZEN NEWSPAPER OFFICES - DAY

          Mary walks out of the elevator and heads through the office.
          Nobody seems to notice her.

          MARY (V.O.)
          Manny says that a crossword
          puzzle's greatness can be
          determined by asking three simple
          questions.
          She marches in the direction of the Editor's office.

          MARY (V.0.)
          Is it solvable?
          She almost collides with a mail cart but keeps walking.

          MARY (V.0.)
          Is it entertaining?
          She arrives at the Editor's office, plants her feet in the
          doorway.

          

          

          

          

          23.

          MARY (V.O.)
          Does it s arkle?
          She looks down at the crossword puzzle in her hands, smiles,
          holds it out for Soloman.
          Soloman grabs the crossword and hands it right to the
          Assistant, who rushes it out the door.

          INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

          Two OLD LADIES sit under the hair dryers, each doing the
          Atlanta Citizen crossword puzzle. They're stumped. The
          first Old Lady hollers over the noise of the dryer.

          OLD LADY

          I CAN'T GET ANY OF THESE!
          The other Old Lady holds up her blank crossword, shrugs.

          male EXECUTIVE sits down and spots the newspaper opened to
          the crossword puzzle.

                         GUY
          Don't even bother, man. I don't

          Steve?
          Mary sits and smiles.

          

          

          

          

          24.

                         SOLOMAN
          Every single answer is "Steve"?
          Who the hell is Steve anyway? No
          wait, I don't care, but I do care
          that you pissed off our readers.
          Mary's smile falls a bit.

                         SOLOMAN
          I thought you knew better than to
          pull something like this. It's
           unprofessional, it's --
           to him.
          He's too frustrated, the words aren't coming

                          MARY
           Romantic?

                          SOLOMAN
           No!

                         MARY
          Creativo? That's Italian for
          "creative".

                         SOLOMAN
          No.

                         MARY
          How about -

                         SOLOMAN
          Mary. We're letting you go.

          Oh.
           up her Kroger
          She looks like she's going to cry. She picks
          bag, fidgets.

                         MARY
          Maybe I could make it up to you by
          doing a fishing themed crossword.
          I know how you love the
          piscatology.
          Soloman shakes his head -- it's done.
          Mary hesitates then finally gets up.

                         MARY
          Okay. I'll just give you some time
          then. We'll talk next week.

          

          

          

          

          25.
          He ignores that. She walks out, seemingly content, a bit of
          denial.
          A PAYROLL CLERK sees the elevator doors close behind Mary.

          PAYROLL CLERK
          She forgot her severance.

                         ASSISTANT
          Don't you mean "Steverance"?
          They both laugh.

          EXT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY

           Mary walks up to the front steps where Mr. Horowitz sits

                          THE
          waiting for her. She sits down beside him. He holds up
          Atlanta Citizen crossword.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          Interesting way to go.

                         MARY
          Indeed.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          They like it?
          She points to the other newspaper in his lap.

                         MARY
          Finished with the Times?
          She goes to take the paper. He stops her.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          Neshama, the puzzle. How'd it go?
          She looks around. Nowhere to run.

                         MARY
          How do you think?
          She looks at him -- worry all over his face. She hesitates
          for a moment then sucks it up.

                         MARY
          Because if you're thinking that
          they loved it, that they thought it
          was imaginative and bold and
          evocative... you would be right.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          He's not sure how to take that.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          And Steve?

                         MARY
          He works a lot, you know. Travels
          all the time. 'Tis possible he has
          not yet espied it.
          She picks up the crossword, admires it.

                         MARY
          But when he does, I'm sure he'll
          say, "that Mary Horowitz... is a
          catch. Where oh where has she been
          all my empty life? From here
          onward my life will be divided into
          'before I met Mary' and 'after I
          met Mary' with the second part
          being far superior. I am lonely no
          more. The missing letter in my
          puzzle has at last been found."

          MR. HOROWITZ
          I don't want you getting your hopes
          up too much.

                         MARY
          I'm not.

          INT. CNN ATLANTA - DAY

          An exec office. Steve relaxes on the sofa next to Angus
          while Hartman noses around the office.

                         ANGUS
          We're going to hit rush. We'll
          have to take the second flight.
          Exec. Producer DAN CORBITT walks in, heads straight for his
          desk.

                         CORBITT
          You're set. KDFW's on site now.
          Angus and Steve start to get up.

                         CORBITT
          Hang on.
          They sit. Corbitt grabs the remote control, turns the TV on.

          

          

          

          

          27.

                         CORBITT
          Anybody want to tell me about this?
          He fast forwards through footage of Hartman reporting from a
          greenhouse. Corbitt slows it to normal speed, mutes it.
          They watch as Hartman interviews an attractive female
          BOTANIST holding a test tube with a seedling in it. Hartman
          keeps pointing to the seedling - which happens to be right in
          front of the Botanist's generous breasts.
          The camera gets closer and closer - each time it pulls away
          Hartman points to the seedling again to force the camera in
          close - basically turning the piece into a giant boob-fest.

                         ANGUS
          Take a look at those... plants.
          Corbitt pauses it on the worst shot, looks at Steve.

                         CORBITT
          We can't use this.
          Hartman fakes disgust.

                         HARTMAN
          Of course not. Nice camera work,
          Stevie.
          Steve glares at Hartman. Corbitt points at the frozen shot
          on the TV screen, looks at Steve.

                         CORBITT
          You want to go back to the Weather
          Channel, try that again.
          Corbitt checks his watch, points them out the door.

                         CORBITT
          Get out of here. Don't embarrass
          me in Dallas.
          Hartman, Angus and Steve walk out. Steve nods to Hartman -
          thanks asshole.
          In the hallway, Steve's cell phone rings. He answers it.

                         STEVE
          What?... Mom, let me call you
          back.

          

          

          

          

          28.
          He listens, signals to Angus he needs a minute, then stops at
          a reception area. He sorts through the newspapers, pulls out
          the Atlanta Citizen, flips through it.

                         STEVE
          What page?
          He finds Mary's crossword. He looks at it closely, totally
          confused. It takes him more than a second to get it.
          He laughs -- then suddenly reality sets in.

                         STEVE
          Jesus.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Mary does a crossword while soaking in the bathtub. Without
          missing an answer, she reaches over the side of the tub,
          grabs the telephone on the floor. She checks the dial tone,
          hangs up quickly, continues with the puzzle.

                         MARY
          Four letter word for am I going to
          wait my whole life for Steve to
          call?
          She suddenly stops writing.

                         MARY
          Nope.
          She flails out of the tub like a salmon heading upstream,
          grabs a towel barely big enough to cover her. Without any
          effort to dry off, she runs out of the bathroom.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - HALLWAY / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          Towel wrapped around her but barely covering, Mary reaches
          the top of the stairs. Her wet feet sliding all over the
          place, she opts for the safety of a banister slide. She gets
          up on it, slides a few inches before realizing what a bad
          idea it was.

                         MARY
          Ow ow ouch.
          She gets off the banister, slops the rest of the way down the
          stairs, jumps into the doorway of the living room.

          

          

          

          

          29.

                         MARY
          The news is Steve's life! It's not
          just what he does, it's who he is,
          imbedded deep down in his polymer
          of nucleotides. I should be out
          there by his side. That's what
          girlfriends do, isn't it? Let him
          concentrate on his work. I'll
          concentrate on the relationship.
          It won't be easy, I know, but
          neither is quantum physics or...
          the Heisenberg Uncertainty
          Principle or... paper mache, but
          I've managed to do fine with those,
          haven't I?
          She looks at her parents. They sit at a table playing bridge
          with MR. and MRS. HANCOCK.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Mary, you remember the Hancocks.

                         MARY
          Top of the evening.
          Mr. Hancock checks out Mary's bare legs as she stands in a
          puddle of bath water. Mrs. Hancock lifts her husband's chin,
          snaps him out of it.

          MRS. HANCOCK
          Loved this week's puzzle, dear.
          Whoever Steve is, he must be a very
          lucky young man.
          Mr. Horowitz gives Mrs. Hancock a look - "don't encourage
          her".

                         MARY
          Exactly! And all I have to do is
          go to him, be near him, and do my
          best to radiate... me.
          Mr. Horowitz doesn't like the sound of this.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          And where exactly will this
          radiation take place?
          Mary rushes to the TV, turns it on, flips it to CNN.

          ON THE TV:

          A shot of the Medieval Times castle in Dallas, TX. The
          banner on the screen reads "WORKPLACE KILLING".

          Wherever news happens, Dad.
          Wherever news happens.

          EXT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - ATLANTA - DAY

          PASSENGERS board the bus destined for Dallas. Way too
          excited in her red boots, Mary is the last in line. She hugs
          her mother then jumps up onto the first step of the bus. Mr.
          Horowitz holds Mary's knapsack and Kroger bag, shakes his
          head in disbelief.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          This is nuts.
          Mary takes the bags from him.

                         MARY
          Abe, Catherine, I'm off. I don't
          know where I'm going -
          The Greyhound Bus DRIVER hollers from behind her.

                         DRIVER
          Dallas.

                         MARY
          Geographically yes, I know.
          Figuratively, philosophically,
          spiritually, much less so. My
          entire life is before me. The
          world is my ostrea edulis... That
          means the edible kind of oyster.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          That's beautiful, sweetie. You
          sure you won't take mine instead?
          She tries to switch her leather bag for Mary's Kroger bag.
          Mary resists, points back and forth between the two bags.

                         MARY
          Mom, two handles, two handles, they
          both hold stuff, what's the
          difference?
          Mrs. Horowitz goes to explain, gives up.

          

          

          

          

          31.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          That Steve shows any disrespect,
          you're on the next bus back here.

                         MARY
          Disrespect. Do you mean
          unmannerly, tactless, vulgar?
          Because he's a straight man, Dad,
          and some things can't be helped.
          But if you mean inconsiderate to
          me, contemptuous toward me,
          insulting, irreverent, uncivil -

                         DRIVER
          Let's go already!
          She steps up one more step, yells out to her parents and the

                         WORLD:

                         MARY
          I don't know when I'll be back but
          I do know this-
          The door shuts in her face.

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS DAY

          Mary waves to her worried parents through the closed door.

                         MARY
          (to herself)
          I'm not coming back alone.

          EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - DALLAS - DAY

          Local and national NEWS CREWS are camped across the road from
          the Medieval Times castle. Among them, Steve holds the CNN
          camera on Hartman. A young audio tech JOSH hovers nearby.

                         HARTMAN
          Paula, what started out as a
          routine rehearsal here at the
          Dallas Medieval Times turned deadly
          when an employee allegedly turned
          on his fellow performers. Twenty-
          four hours later, at least thirty
          employees are still being held
          hostage by the assailant, their
          lives hanging in the balance.
          He listens to his earpiece, nods.

          

          

          

          

          32.

                         HARTMAN
          The castle you see behind me is one
          of eight medieval Times dinner
          theatre restaurants. Guests who
          cross the drawbridge enjoy a
          medieval style feast while watching
          the main attraction: knights
          engaging in a battle of strength
          and skill. The restaurant promises
          "fun, feasting and fighting" but it
          appears that this time, fun was in
          short supply.
          A few feet away, Angus frantically takes notes as he talks to
          a MAINTENANCE WORKER, then slips a piece of paper to Hartman.

                         HARTMAN
          Paula, devastating news just in.
          We have one confirmed death - an
          Andalusian - a purebred Spanish
          horse. One of many that perform in
          the show, and the first innocent
          victim of a rogue knight's rage...
          He takes a moment to fake compose himself, barely getting the
          words out.

                         HARTMAN
          At times like this, I like to think
          there's a heaven just for horses.
          A rolling meadow, lush grasses,
          unlimited supply of... those things
          horses like to lick - or is that
          cows? Nevertheless, a beautiful,
          peaceful place.
          He turns and looks toward to the Medieval Times.

                         HARTMAN
          May you long roam in that heaven,
          noble horse -
          Angus hands him another note. Hartman scans it, instantly
          kills the fake anguish.

                         HARTMAN
          But not quite yet. We're the first
          to report, the horse is not dead,
          Paula. Not dead. The horse is
          alive and well after having merely
          fainted, as it was trained to do
          for the show. One happy, blessed
          miracle...

          to hold the lives of his coworkers
          in his depraved hands.
          And they're out. A pissed off Hartman pulls out his
          earpiece.

                         HARTMAN
          Dammit, Angus. Get it a bit closer
          to right before you hand it to me.
          Josh moves in, removes Hartman's mic.

                         STEVE
          But then we wouldn't have heard
          about horse heaven.
          Josh and Angus laugh.

          It's that kind of genius that won

          Family Coalition's Journalist of
          the Year award, you ingrates.

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT

          The bus is full. Most PASSENGERS sleep.
          Mary sits in the aisle seat of the first row, a BURLY MAN in
          his 60's beside her. The light above their seats illuminates
          the crossword puzzle he's working on. Mary looks over his
          shoulder, points to the blank spaces in his puzzle.

                         MARY
          Omaha... Einstein... cholera...
          grenade... Bach... oui...
          potbelly... Oreo.
          The man drops the crossword, glares at her.

                         MARY
          Sorry.
          She looks away, starts biting her nails, then spots a sign on
          the freeway, calls-out to the Driver and anybody else who
          will listen.

                         MARY
          Bessemer, Alabama! Named after Sir
          Henry Bessemer, a Brit. Guess what
          he did? Perfected the way steel is
          made, of course.

          I won't bore you with the whole
          story, just the best parts, like
          how it involves molten pig iron
          which does not, as one might think,
          have anything to do with pigs.
          It's actually a raw iron made from
          iron ore, plus limestone, plus coke
          - and by coke I mean the
          carbonaceous residue, not the cola,
          or the booger sugar.
          Mary looks around for a response -- nothing.

                         MARY
          You know what else is in Bessemer?
          The city, I mean? Hitler's
          typewriter. It's crazy, I know.
          That guy was such an asshole.
           The Driver's eyes glaze over. Please let this and.

          The Driver looks at the passengers. Most of them are still
          sleeping.

                         DRIVER
          We'll just take five minutes here.
          He steps off the bus. Mary turns to the man next to her.

                         MARY
          Can you watch my stuff?
          He glares at her -- you have got to be kidding. Mary grabs
          her backpack and Kroger bag and steps off the bus.

          INT. REST STOP - NIGHT

          Mary walks into the restaurant, heads toward the ladies room.
          On her way, she spots a television behind the counter. A few
          DINERS watch. Mary joins them.
          On the TV: "MEDIEVAL TIMES HOSTAGE CRISIS".

          

          

          

          

          35.

                         HARTMAN
          (on TV)
          Perhaps the greatest obstacle the
          hostage negotiators face is the
          suspect's refusal to communicate
          using modern day technology. In
          keeping with his role as a medieval
          knight, he's insisting on an
          eleventh century messenger to
          deliver all communication.
          The screen splits with a female news ANCHOR.

                         ANCHOR
          What are we talking about here,
          Hartman? Carrier pigeons?

                         MARY
          Homing pigeons.
          A few of the Diners overhear.

                         HARTMAN
          Actually, homing pigeons.
          The Diners look at Mary.

                         MARY
          Carrier pigeons, despite their
          name, are more or less useless when
          it comes to actually carrying
          anything. Homing pigeons are
          better for messenger work...
          The Diners lose interest. Mary catches the eye of a WANDERER
          at the end of the counter. He's hanging on her every word.

                         MARY
          You know who used them all the
          time? Genghis Khan. Loved the
          pigeons, scared to death of pooches
          though.
          The Wanderer just stares at her.

                         MARY
          You know, dogs, canines, de honden?
          Still nothing. She looks back at the TV.

          

          

          

          

          36.

                         ANCHOR
          Have the negotiators located any
          homing pigeons? Where do you even
          get them in this day and age?

                         HARTMAN
          You can buy them on the internet
          for twenty-five bucks a pop.
          Mary looks at the Diners, smiles, points to the TV.

                         MARY
          My boyfriend is probably holding
          that camera right now.
          The Diners ignore her and just eat their pie. Mary realizes
          the time, runs out of the rest stop.

          EXT. REST STOP - NIGHT

          Mary runs out into the parking lot. The bus is gone.

                         MARY
          Crap! Crap, crap, crap!
          She looks down the road -- no sign of the bus anywhere. She
          takes her paper bag out of her pocket, breathes into it.
          A TRUCK DRIVER passes her with coffee in hand, on his way to
          his rig.

                         MARY
          Do you know when the next bus to
          Dallas goes through here?

          TRUCK DRIVER
          Can't say I do.

                         MARY
          I missed mine.
          She breathes double time into the paper bag. He takes pity
          on her.

          TRUCK DRIVER
          I'm headed that way.
          He points to his truck. Mary looks at the truck, looks at
          him, looks at the truck, thinks about it for a long time.

          

          

          

          

          37.
          With no sign of an answer forthcoming, the Truck Driver keeps
          walking to his rig. When he's just about there, Mary yells
          out to him.

                         MARY
          You ever killed animals?
          He looks at her, surprised but amused.

          TRUCK DRIVER
          Road kill?

                         MARY
          Set a garbage can full of kittens
          on fire or anything like that?
          Now he's disturbed.

          TRUCK DRIVER
          No.

                         MARY
          Humans?

          TRUCK DRIVER
          Would I tell you if I did?

                         MARY
          Touche, sir. Touche.
          Mary thinks some more.

          TRUCK DRIVER
          Wait for the next bus if that suits
          you.
          He climbs into the truck. Mary runs to catch up with him.

                         MARY
          Do you have a .light? Matches,
          Zippo, blow torch, et al?

          TRUCK DRIVER
          Afraid not.

                         MARY
          May I see your license?
          Why not. He pulls his license out of the visor, flashes it.
          Mary steps up and grabs it, looks at it closely.

                         MARY
          Norman James Durwood.

          

          

          

          

          38.
          She reaches up and shakes his hand.

                         MARY
          Mary Magdalene Horowitz.

          TRUCK DRIVER/NORM
          Good to meet you... I think.
          Still holding the license, she digs in her Kroger bag, pulls
          out a large black magic marker. She pushes up her sleeve and
          writes Norm's license number in huge print down her arm.

                         MARY
          Norm, if you're going to rape and
          murder me, you'll have to cut me up
          into a million chunks and scatter
           me all over four states, otherwise
          this appendage -
          She holds her arm up, shows him.

                         MARY
          Will lead homicide detectives right
          to you.
          She smiles at him warmly, puts the marker back in her bag.

                         MARY
          And you already told me you don't
          have a light to burn the flesh off.
          Norm can't believe this. Before he can say a word, Mary
          moves around to the passenger side, hops up into the truck.
          She notices some snacks on the dash.

                         MARY
          Moon Pies! Want to go halfsies?
          At a loss, Norm motions for Mary to help herself. As she
          unwraps a Pie, he reluctantly starts up the truck.

          EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - DALLAS - NIGHT

          Steve reloads his battery camera at the rental van. Angus
          looks over paperwork.

          What?

                         STEVE
          It's a set up.

                         ANGUS
          She's hot.

                         STEVE
          I don't care. Never again. My mom
          set me up with this chick -

                         ANGUS
          You let you mother set you up?
          What the hell is wrong with you?
          There's a commotion in the distance. Every photographer on
          the grounds focuses on the castle. Reporters jump into
          position.
          Hartman touches up his make-up, roots through his bag. He
          yells out to Steve, Angus and Josh.

                         HARTMAN
          Which one of you bastards hid my
          bronzing shimmer?
          The police surrounding the castle take aim.
          Dead silence as the Medieval Times drawbridge lowers.
          A KNIGHT walks out, arms raised as high as his squeaking
          armor will allow, which is not very high, but high enough to
          get the point across -- Surrender.

          INT. NORM'S TRUCK -- NIGHT

          Norm drives as Mary drones on while flipping through a truck
          repair manual.

                         MARY
          And my other rule about crossword
          puzzles is this. No pencils.
          Doing a crossword with a pencil is
          like screaming with your lips duct
          taped together. It's weak.

          If you're going to do a crossword,
          you should do it fearlessly, with
          abandon, and with a pen. I prefer
          a medium tip, felt, blue -

                         NORM
          Quiet time might be good right
          about now.

                         MARY
          Oh.
          She thinks about it, whispers.

                         MARY
          Do you mean quiet as in softly
          hushed like this? Or do you mean
          quiet, as in silent?
          He nods. Mary squeezes her lips together, holds them. It
          lasts for about a second.

                         MARY
          Norm?

                         NORM
          What?

                         MARY
          Thanks for not raping me.

          My pleasure.

           As the sun comes up, Norm's truck drives into Dallas.

           EXT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - DALLAS - DAY

           Norm's truck drives away, leaving Mary standing on the side
          of Interstate 35. She looks across the road to the Medieval
          Times -- it's completely deserted.

                         MARY
          Eight letter word for "screwed".
          Mary crosses to the Medieval Times parking lot, steps over
          the police line blowing in the wind.

                         MARY
          F-A-S-T-E-N-E-D. Fastened.

          She looks around. There's nobody for miles.

          MARY (V.O.)
          That's what's great about
          crosswords, and life. Every once
          in a while, you get a surprise.
          She heads back to the interstate, starts walking.

          INT. BUS STATION - DAY

          Mary walks past TV in the bus station tuned to Fox News.
          On every screen - images of an upset WOMAN dodging press to

          My road, dad. My road. You don't
          commit to a relationship and then
          give up because you'd rather be at
          home curled up in front of the
          fireplace with a thesaurus. This
          is what people are supposed to do -
          go out on a limb for love. My limb
          just happens to be in Oklahoma.
          It's only 850 miles away from home.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY

          Dozens of local and national news vans line the streets
          surrounding the hospital.
          A long line of news crews, views of the hospital's admitting
          entrance behind them. At one end of the line, a male KOCO
          (Oklahoma) REPORTER talks to camera.

          KOCO REPORTER
          Eleven months ago, the child we've
          come to know as Baby Peggy was born
          with an extremely rare birth
          defect, a third leg. Shortly after
          the birth, her parents Misty and
          Bill Dunlevy separated. Now with
          joint custody, one parent wants the
          baby to keep the third leg, the
          other wants it gone...
          A few feet away, a female FOX NEWS REPORTER is on camera.

          FOX NEWS REPORTER
          After months of legal wrangling, a
          judge has ordered in favor of the
          mother. Amputation surgery is
          scheduled for Wednesday but the
          father, Bill Dunlevy, isn't about
          to give up. As his lawyers work to
          secure an injunction, the devoted
          father rallies public support for
          the extra limb.

          

          

          

          

          43.
          At the end of the long line of news crews, Steve has the
          camera on Hartman.

                         HARTMAN

                         (READING)
          "God wouldn't have given my child
          the third leg if he didn't want her
          to keep it." But for now, the fate
          of that precious child's third leg
          is the hands of a judge... This is
          Hartman Hughes reporting, live from
          Oklahoma City.
          Steve signals they've cut, lowers his camera. Hartman calls
          out to Angus.

                         HARTMAN
          What if next time I say Baby Peggy
          is like the wishbone of her
          parents' dispute?
          Hartman acts out a wishbone pull. Steve's disgusted.

                         STEVE
          Yeah, go ahead and suggest that.
          Corbitt will love it.
          Steve turns and looks toward the edge of the fenced off
          hospital grounds. Dozens of PROTESTORS are camped out - a
          sorry assortment of oddballs standing at the fence, waving
          their signs: "SPARE THE LEG", and "HONOR THE FATHER". Many
          of them carry drawings of a three legged baby wearing a halo.
          Steve braces himself and heads for the crowd. Half way
          across, he spots a loner walking from the parking lot. He's
          35, chubby, his shirt buttoned one button off so it hangs
          lower on the left. This is HOWARD. In one hand: a pro-leg
          sign. In his other hand: a carton of chocolate milk.
          Howard stops to lick up the chocolate milk spilling all over
          his arm. Steve catches up with him.

                         STEVE
          Mind if I ask you a few questions
          on camera?

                         HOWARD
          Me?

                         STEVE
          How do you feel about what's going
          on here?

          

          

          

          

          44.
          Steve shoulders his camera, focuses in on Howard's sign.
          It's an impressively detailed drawing of a judge yanking a
          baby's third leg off.

                         HOWARD
          I haven't made up my mind yet.
          Both parties have valid arguments.

          EXT. 13TH STREET - DAY

          HOSPITAL STAFF, PROTESTORS and the curious PUBLIC approach
          the hospital grounds.
          A taxi inches through the crowd. It barely stops when Mary
          leaps out like she's late for a Yanni concert.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - DAY

          Mary steps onto the hospital grounds and looks all around her
          - NEWS CREWS circulate, PATIENTS and staff walk in and out of
          the hospital, protestors line the fence. Somewhere in the
          middle, she finds what she's hunting for -- Steve.
          Mary's face lights up and she starts running toward him - in
          her mind, no doubt in slow motion, with clouds parting to
          light her way.
          Steve's attention is drawn away from the interview with
          Howard. He spots Mary running toward him, arms outstretched.

                         STEVE
          Please God, no.
          He looks for a place to hide but she's running ridiculously
          fast. It's too late. She's only a few feet away.

                         MARY
          Steve!
          She jumps into his arms but he's only got one arm free and
          isn't about to use it to catch her. She slides down his leg
          to the ground but quickly picks herself up.

                         MARY
          I'm here! Surprised?

                         STEVE
          Surprised?

          

          

          

          

          45.

                         MARY
          Astounded, flabbergasted,
          bushwacked -
          He pulls Mary off to the side, away from everybody.

                         STEVE
          What are you doing?

                         MARY
          Talking to you. And noticing how
          the Oklahoma climate agrees with
          your complexion.

                         STEVE
          Tell me you didn't come all the way
          here just to see me.

                         MARY
          Of course not... I went to Dallas
          looking for you first. And you
          know why?
          Steve grabs his head. This is not happening.

                         MARY
          Because you're inimitable and I'm
          intransigent.

                         STEVE
          No, we're not. I don't know what
          that means but trust me. We're so
          not.

                         MARY
          It means you're awesome and I'm
          unstoppable.

                         STEVE
          Great. Listen, Mary, you seem like
          a nice girl, and the ten minutes we
          spent together were --

                         MARY
          Mind blowing.
          At a complete loss, he just goes along.

                         STEVE
          Sure, but I'm working here.
          Working.

          

          

          

          

          46.
          Mary points to the partially hidden side door of the
          hospital. A MAN with his face covered, in a nurse's uniform
          and dress shoes, sneaks out the door unnoticed.

                         MARY
          I know. I'm just here to support
          you, show you I care, and also ask
          why you aren't following that guy
          pretending to be a nurse but
          obviously not wearing sterilizable,
          non-slip footwear.
          Steve looks toward the hospital, spots the Man.

                         MARY
          If I was Baby Peggy's dad, that's
          how I'd avoid the press too.
          Steve takes off running. Mary yells out to him.

                         MARY
          I'll be right here in case you want
          to make out later on!
          Steve looks back, a bunch of people stare. Mary waves to him
          then watches until he's out of sight.
          A SECURITY GUARD approaches her.

          SECURITY GUARD
          Miss, if you want to be here,
          you're going to have to stay behind
          the fence.
          Mary turns to see what he's pointing at - the growing crowd
          of protestors off in the distance. They wave their signs
          around, cry, sing and sway together, their painful song
          barely audible from afar.

                         PROTESTORS
          Near, far, wherever you are, we
          believe that the leg should stay
          on...
          Mary watches, paralyzed with awe, like seeing herself in the
          mirror for the first time ever.
          At last, she has found her people.

          

          

          

          

          47.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - DAY

          An overweight 30ish woman ELIZABETH (who shouldn't be wearing
          those low rise pants and cropped tee) lights a bunch of
          candles in the grass behind the protestor fence. She reaches
          the last candle in line just as Mary walks up to join the
          group.
          Elizabeth looks up at Mary, smiles.

                         ELIZABETH
          I like your boots.

                         MARY
          Thanks. I found them in an alley.
          Elizabeth looks at the boots again, impressed. She stands
          up.

                         ELIZABETH
          Are you pro-leg or anti-leg?

                         MARY
          Neither really.

                         ELIZABETH
          This is the pro-leg group over
          here. We're supporting Baby
          Peggy's dad in his fight to save
          the baby's third leg.
          She points to the end of the fenced off area where only a few
           protestors hold anti-leg signs:"NORMAL LIFE FOR BABY PEGGY",

          "3 LEGS ARE NOT BETTER THAN 2".

                         ELIZABETH
          Those are the anti-leggers.
          They're all for the amputation.

                         MARY
          I'm just here because my boyfriend
          is working the story. He's with
          CNN, the world's news leader, the
          most trusted name in news, the
          place where more -

                         ELIZABETH
          The pro-leggers have better snacks.

                         MARY
          I'm definitely pro-leg.

          

          

          

          

          48.
          Elizabeth smiles, hands Mary a candle.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE -- NIGHT

          Mr. and Mrs. Horowitz watch TV and read at the same time.
          The TV is on mute --- CNN's Baby Peggy coverage.
          In the corner of the screen, "amputation countdown - 35
          hours". Shots of the protestors' candlelight vigil appear on
          the screen.
          Mrs. Horowitz spots Mary in the crowd, standing next to
          Elizabeth. She sings and waves her candle around, all the
          while straining to look for Steve.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          There she is! Abe, look! There
          she is right there.
          Mr. Horowitz glances up from his book.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          She's going to set her hair on fire
          with that candle.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Look, she's made friends.
          Mrs. Horowitz tries not to cry.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT

          At the back doors of the rental van, Steve and Angus work on
          laptops. Steve confides in Angus, trying not to wake up
          Hartman sleeping on the back seat.

                         STEVE
          She's on me what, thirty seconds
          after meeting me, and the chick
          will not shut up the whole time. I
          had to fake a work call, gave her
          the -

                         ANGUS
          (imitating Steve)
          Wherever news goes...

          

          

          

          

          49.

                         STEVE
          I think I'm in the clear, then she
          does this crossword - she works for
          the Citizen - she does this
          crossword all about me, and as if
          that's not crazy enough, she shows
          up here.

                         ANGUS
          Here?

                         STEVE
          Over by the fence. Red boots.
          Can't miss her.

                         ANGUS
          Is she hot?

                         STEVE
          Jesus, Angus. When a psychotic
          chick's swinging a machete at your
          throat, who cares if she's hot?

                         ANGUS
          I've been married to the same woman
          for seventeen years. I care.

                         STEVE
          Crazy, man. The chick is cra-zy.
          Hartman sits up, totally awake and never happier. He points
          at Steve.

                         HARTMAN
          Priceless! This is priceless!
          Steve cringes.

                         STEVE
          Hughes, don't. Don't even.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT

          A short, 60ish PROTESTOR and his PROTESTOR WIFE talk to an
          Oklahoma Journal Record NEWSPAPER REPORTER at the fence.

          PROTESTOR WIFE
          All we're saying is, wait until
          Baby Peggy can talk and ask her
          what she wants to do with the
          spare.

          

          

          

          

          50.
          Mary listens in while she dispenses a hot chocolate from
          another protestor's backpack thermos. She finishes pouring,
          taps the guy on the shoulder.

                         MARY
          Thanks, Bruno.
          He walks away. Mary takes a sip of the hot chocolate, burns
          her mouth.

                         MARY
          Crap.
          She grabs her tongue with her fingers. Hartman appears right
          in front of her.

                         HARTMAN
          M'lady.
          She's a bit stunned and star struck. He offers his hand.

                         HARTMAN
          Hartman Hughes.
          Mary lets go of her tongue, uses her saliva covered hand to
          shake his.

                         MARY
          Mary.

                         HARTMAN
          Mary'. Mary, Mary, Mary.
          He takes his hand back, discretely wipes it on his pants.

                         HARTMAN
          Steve told me you were beautiful.
          He was going on and on and on and
          on about it. I had to come see for
          myself. Great boots.

                         MARY
          Thank y-
          He puts an arm around her, pulls her away from the crowd.

                         HARTMAN
          Listen, Mary, I've been working
          with Steve for about a year now.
          The guy is like a brother to me.
          A YOUNG PROTESTOR recognizes Hartman.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          YOUNG PROTESTOR
          Hartman Hughes'.
          Without missing a step, Hartman grabs a pen from his pocket
          and autographs the guy's sign whether he wants it or not,
          then continues on with Mary.

                         HARTMAN
          Girls follow us around everywhere
          we go. Who do you think they're
          after?
          Hartman reflects on it, smiles.

                         HARTMAN
          Me, of course me, but every once in
          a while some of them try to land
          Steve. It's true. Sure he'll go
          for a few skanks here and there but
          it's all just a sad attempt to hide
          his fear. All he wants is to love
          but he's afraid of opening up,
          afraid of putting himself out
          there, afraid of somebody like you,
          Mary - yes you - afraid of you
          breaking his heart. Can you blame
          him?
          She's a bit stunned and confused by all of this.

                         MARY
          No?

                         HARTMAN
          No! Promise me this. Promise
          you'll stick around long enough to
          help him get over that fear. He
          tells you to go away, don't. He
          says he thinks you're crazy?
          You're not. He's crazy, Mary.
          Crazy not to let down his walls and
          tell you how he really feels. Can
          I count on you to hang in there no
          matter what?

                         MARY
          Of course. I don't want to
          interfere in his work but I just
          need to be here for him and -
          He grabs her, hugs her in so her words are all muffled - and
          yet she keeps talking.

          

          

          

          

          52.

                         HARTMAN
          Good girl.
          The SECURITY GUARD walks past, gestures that they should be
          behind the fence. Hartman holds up his press pass to get rid
          of the Guard, then lets go of Mary. He points her toward the
          protestors, starts backing away.

                         HARTMAN
          I'll tell Steve to come find you
          when we wrap for the day. What
          side are you on?

                         MARY
          Pro-leg.
          She shows him her button featuring a cartoon of a very happy
          three legged baby. Hartman laughs.

                         HARTMAN
          You might want to jump camps. No
          way they're going let that baby
          keep the third leg and live like a
          freak. Trust me.
          He waves and turns around, starts heading for the press camp.
          Mary calls out to him.

                         MARY
          She'd just be like the tree frogs.
          Hartman turns around. What?

                         MARY
          A trematode parasite causes
          polymely (that means extra limbs)
          in tree frogs. It happens all the
          time. In some ponds there's like a
          quarter of the tree frogs with
          extra legs. Totally natural.
          Hartman looks at her like she's a nutcase.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT

          Angus is on his phone as Steve rushes to set up his
          equipment. Hartman arrives back at the van.

                         HARTMAN
          What's going on?
          Josh rushes to get the mic on Hartman.

          

          

          

          

          53.

                         JOSH
          The parents of the kid got back
          together. Surgery's cancelled.

                         HARTMAN
          No amputation?

                         STEVE
          Tell me you weren't talking to
          Mary.

                         HARTMAN
          Who?

                         STEVE
          Go to hell, Hughes.
          scans it
          Angus hands Hartman the press release. Hartman
          quickly.

                         HARTMAN
          It's over? The kid keeps the leg.

                         ANGUS
          For now.
          Hartman checks his teeth in a hand mirror.

                         HARTMAN
          'Til she gets it caught in a car
          door.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT

          News spreads around the pro-leg protestors camp. They all
          start hollering with joy.
          The disappointed anti-leg protestors ditch their signs and
          storm off.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - NIGHT

          Mr. Horowitz is asleep in front of the TV. He wakes up as
          the amputation countdown clock on the news stops.

          KOCO REPORTER
          With mere hours to spare, the
          Dunlevys reconciled, agreeing to
          halt surgery until Baby Peggy is
          old enough to decide for herself.
          Further down the row of reporters:

          FOX NEWS REPORTER
          And while dozens of children fight
          for their lives behind these walls,
          Baby Peggy won't be one of them.
          With surgery cancelled, it's time
          for the Dunlevys to be a family
          once again.
          Past a few more news crews, at the end the line, Steve has
          the camera on Hartman.

                         HARTMAN
          And like the noble tree frog whose
          extra leg is nothing if not
          natural, so Baby Peggy begins the
          rest of her three legged life...
          This is Hartman Hughes reporting
          live from Oklahoma City.
          Hartman pulls out his ear piece. Angus, Josh and Steve all
          look at him, a bit surprised.

                         STEVE
          Tree frog? Where do you get this
          shit?
          Hartman taps the side of his head -- it's all up here.

                         HARTMAN
          A little thing called astutitude,
          my friends.
          Steve and Angus look at each other -- is that even a word?

          EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT

          Mary celebrates with the other protestors. The Protestor and
          his Protestor Wife cry tears of joy. Mary pulls a tissue out
          of her bag, hands it over. The husband takes it, turns away
          and wipes his eyes.

          

          

          

          

          55.

                         MARY
          There you go, George. Just a
          little nasolacrimal duct cleaning.
          Nothing to be ashamed of.
          Elizabeth runs up to Mary, hugs her.

                         ELIZABETH
          You see? When you sing loud enough
          and when your signs are big enough,
          people listen!
          Mary spots some of the news vans pulling away.

                         MARY
          Steve!

                         ELIZABETH
          Go, go on. I'll watch your stuff.
          Mary drops her bags, runs toward the media camp.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA MEDIA CAMP - NIGHT

          Josh pulls the back doors of the van shut.

          INT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT

          Angus at the wheel, Hartman in the passenger seat. In the
          back, Steve nervously looks out the windows. Josh gets in
          next to him.
          Angus starts driving slowly across the grass behind other
          news vans. Steve finally relaxes.

          EXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT

          As the van drives, Mary runs to catch up.

                         MARY
          Steve! STEVE!

          INT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT

          Hartman spots Mary in the rear view mirror.

                         HARTMAN
          Angus, hold up.

          

          

          

          

          56.
          Steve sees what Hartman's looking at.

                         STEVE
          No, go. Fast.
          Hartman rolls down his window.

                         STEVE
          Don't.
          Hartman sticks his head out the window.

                         STEVE
          Hughes, I swear I'll kill you.
          Hartman waves to Mary to catch up. Angus sees her in the
          mirror as he drives.

                         ANGUS
          Is that her? She's hot.

                         STEVE
          Angus, come on man, get me out of
          here.

                         ANGUS
          She's really hot.

                         STEVE
          Who cares? Jesus, you guys -
          Angus hits the brakes. Steve hides behind the seat just as
          Mary catches up with the van.

                         HARTMAN
          Hi beautiful.
          Mary tries to get a look at Steve but can only see part of
          his back hunched over behind the seat.

                         MARY
          Steve? Are you okay? Is he okay?
          Angus leans over to her window.

                         ANGUS
          I don't think we've met. Angus.
          Mary shakes Angus' hand. He can't take his eyes off her.

                         HARTMAN
          Steve's not feeling well.

          

          

          

          

          57.

                         MARY
          Oh no.

                         HARTMAN
          I'm sure he'll be fine by the time
          we get to New Mexico.

                         ANGUS
          Your eyes are striking.
          Steve punches him through the seat. Mary's oblivious.

                         MARY
          Thank you.

                         HARTMAN
          Steve really wants you to follow
          us. It would mean a lot to him.

                         STAYS
          Steve cringes, goes to speak up but stops himself and
          hidden.

                         HARTMAN
          He was going to go ask you himself
          but look at the poor bastard. So
          sick he can't even sit up straight.

                         MARY
          What if it's a viral zoonotic
          disease? He should see a doctor.

                         HARTMAN
          Exactly what I told him, but the
          only person he wants touching his
          infected flesh is you.
          Mary looks at Steve, worried.

                         MARY
          But wait, what if -
          up.
          Hartman grabs her face, squishes her lips to shut her

                         HARTMAN
          Hey now, we need you to be strong
          for him. Leachinan trial, Santa Fe,
          can you remember that?
          Mary nods, unable to speak.

                         HARTMAN
          We'll meet you there, God willing.

          

          

          

          

          58.
          He lets go of her face.

                         MARY
          Will you take care of him?

                         HARTMAN
          Like he's my own.
          She backs away from the window. Angus waves to her and
          starts driving.

                         ANGUS
          Nothing wrong with that one.

                         JOSH
          Except for those boots.

                         STEVE
          You're an asshole, Hughes.
          Hartman laughs.

          EXT. RENTAL VAN - NIGHT

          Mary watches the van drive away.

          EXT. OKLAHOMA PROTESTORS CAMP - NIGHT

          Only a few protestors remain. Abandoned signs and garbage
          cover the grass. Elizabeth gets autographs from other
          protestors like it's the last day of high school.
          Mary runs up, grabs her bags.

                         MARY
          Elizabeth! I have to meet Steve at
          his next job, in New Mexico. He's
          sick, not as in rad, although he is
          that too, but more like unwell,
          infirm, perhaps barfy. Hopefully
          nothing serious but you never can
          be too sure and besides, healthy or
          not, he needs me.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sign my book before you go?
          Elizabeth hands her the ratty hand decorated book and a pen.

          

          

          

          

          59.

                         MARY
          The trip's not too long, right
          through all kinds of interesting
          sites like, for example, El
          Santuario de Chimayo: The Lourdes
          of America. Know what that is? A
          sacred sand pit near a burrito
          stand. What could be better than
          that?
          Mary looks away from Elizabeth, fidgets a bit.

                         MARY
          Want to go? Unless you're busy, I
          mean. You probably have something
          better to do.
          Elizabeth thinks about it.

                         ELIZABETH
          Not really.
          Mary is stunned. She takes a minute to realize it's real,
          gets excited. From behind her:

          HOWARD (O.S.)
          I'll go too.
          Mary turns around and spots Howard.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mary, have you met Howard?
          Mary shakes her head. Howard offers his hand. It's got
          dried chocolate milk all over it. She takes it.

                         ELIZABETH
          Mary, Howard. Howard, Mary. Mary,
          Howard's got a car, you know. He
          can drive us.
          Mary looks at him, thinks about it.

                         MARY
          What kind of car do you have?

                         HOWARD
          Plymouth Colt.

                         MARY
          What year?

          

          

          

          

          60.

                         HOWARD
          Eighty-nine.
          Mary quickly scans her memory.

                         MARY
          Replace the recalled seat belts?

                         HOWARD
          Yes.
          Mary thinks about it, smiles.

                         MARY
          Let's grab souvenirs!
          Elizabeth and Howard each pick up a Baby Peggy sign off the
          ground. Mary grabs as many as she can hold -- way, way too
          many. A bunch of them slide off but she perseveres.

          MARY (V.0.)
          Here's something you never see in
          crosswords, two letter words, and
          thank goodness for that. The word
          "go": not fun. The word "vamoose":
          super fun. You see? crosswords
          are just like life in that way -
          they're only boring if you have no
          sense of adventure.

          INT. HOWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

          Howard starts the car. In the passenger seat, Elizabeth has
          a bunch of the protest signs crammed in at her feet.
          Mary gets settled in the back seat, spots a copy of
          Scientific American magazine, then finds an apple stuck
          behind the seat belt. She yanks the apple out, looks at it.
          Howard looks at her in the rear view mirror.

                         HOWARD
          You can have that. I have more.

                         MARY
          Thanks.
          Mary puts the apple in her Kroger bag.

                         MARY
          Howard, if you get sleepy and want
          to trade off driving for a while,
          just wake me up and I'll take over.

                         (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          61.
          MARY (cont'd)
          I'm a night owl, yes, but I'm also
          a day owl too, a burrowing owl,
          technically. They stay awake all
          day too. I'm pretty much alert
          24/7, always have been. No
          caffeine. Just sugar and my
          natural tendency to, you know,
          never fall asleep.
          Mary leans back, closes her eyes, and she's out.

          EXT. I-40 - NIGHT

          Howard's car merges onto the highway, westbound toward New
          Mexico and into the night. Mary sleep talks in the back.

                         MARY
          Persimmon. AKA, the mabolo, the
          date-plum, the velvet apple.
          Genus: Diospyros.

          EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - DAY

          A media extravaganza - local, national and this time,
          international news teams.
          A REPORTER for Inside Edition talks on camera.

          INSIDE EDITION REPORTER
          This tragedy began eight months ago
          in what was once paradise - the
          Elysium Sanctuary outside of Taos,
          New Mexico. For years, celebrities
          considered the five star meditation
          resort the only true place for
          spiritual purification, and with
          good reason. Nestled in the heart
          of reclaimed Pueblo Indian lands,
          the Elysium Sanctuary promised one
          thing - enlightenment.
          A COURT TV REPORTER is on camera a few feet away.

          COURT TV REPORTER
          But the Elysium Sanctuary would
          never be the same after tragedy
          struck last winter. Twenty-six
          year old resort masseuse Juan
          Carlos Velasquez found stabbed to
          death in the meditation villa of
          beloved star of stage and screen,
          Cloris Leachman.

          

          

          

          

          62.
          A bit further down the'line of reporters, an EXTRA! REPORTER
          is on camera.

          EXTRA! REPORTER
          Publicists for the eighty year old
          Leachman insist her relationship
          with the deceased Velasquez was no
          different than with the dozens of
          other resort personnel attending to
          Ms. Leachman during her solitude
          retreat.
          At the end of the row, Hartman reports.

                         HARTMAN
          But the octogenarian Leachman may
          not have been as innocent as her
          representatives claimed, at least
          according to the evidence found at
          the murder scene.
          Hartman reads from his notes.

                         HARTMAN
          Whips, hot wax, bamboo skewers, a
          spanking bench, and perhaps most
          damaging, a henna tattoo across Ms.
          Leachman's chest that read "Mrs.
          Juan Carlos Velasquez".

          EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - DAY

          Elizabeth, Mary and Howard step onto the curb and survey the
          crowd.
          On one side, an odd assortment of fans with signs like "FREE
          CLORIS", "JAIL REAL CRIMINALS, NOT OLD LADIES" and "OSCAR
          WINNERS DON'T KILL", with photos of Cloris Leachman through
          the years.
          On the other side of the crowd, a smaller group of MEXICAN
          MOURNERS with signs "JUSTICE FOR JUAN", "GUILTY", and "LET

          THE BITCH FRY".

                         HOWARD
          Guilty or not?
          They all think about it. A greasy haired Shaman CLYDE steps
          up behind them.

          

          

          

          

          63.

                         CLYDE
          Everybody deserves the benefit of
          the doubt.
          He looks at Mary, smiles.

                         CLYDE
          Everybody.
          As he joins the Leachman fans, Mary thinks about it.

                         MARY
          Be has a point.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yay! I love Cloris Leachman.

                         HOWARD
          Who doesn't?

          MEXICAN MOURNERS
          jMuerte! iMuerte! iMuerte!

                         MARY
          I have to go find Steve. How do I
          look?
          Unwashed hair, bed head, and there's a chunk of a Twinkie
          caked onto Mary's ear. Elizabeth picks the Twinkie off,
          smooths down Mary's hair.

                         ELIZABETH
          Perfect.

                         MARY
          I'll be back. Save me a sign! And
          if Cloris comes out, tell her I
          loved her in "My Little Pony: The
          Movie".
          Mary runs off as Howard and Elizabeth join the crowd of fans.

          EXT. SANTA FE FEDERAL COURT HOUSE - MEDIA CAMP - DAY

          Mary walks among the news vans. At the entrance to a nearby
          tent, Hartman spots her, waves her over.

                         HARTMAN
          Hi gorgeous. What'd you do to your
          hair?

          

          

          

          

          64.

                         MARY
          Slept on it in the car. Where's
          Steve? Is he okay?

                         HARTMAN
          Never better. Come in and wait.
          He'll be back soon.

          INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY

          A briefing area is set up - folding chairs, table, podium. A
          bunch of male journalists sit around the table playing poker -
          Vince (CNN), DOUG (CNN), the COURT TV REPORTER, a BBC NEWS
           PHOTOGRAPHER, a FRENCH PHOTOGRAPHER, A SPANISH JOURNALIST and
          Angus.
          Hartman escorts Mary in. The guys perk up a bit.

                         HARTMAN
          You all know Mary? Steve's
          girlfriend?
          Mary shakes hands around the table, greets them all in their

          She gets to Angus. He kisses her hand.

                         ANGUS
          My dear, sit.
          He shoves the BBC guy out of the way to make room for Mary
          next to him. Vince shuffles the cards.

          Howard wanders through the crowd wearing an "I V Cloris" t-
          shirt over his own. He passes a VENDOR selling "Innocence
          Beads", "Acquittal Incense" and "autographed" Cloris Leachman
          photos.
          The crowd continues to grow. A Candles are lit, healing
          rituals performed, donuts passed around.

          INT. MEDIA TENT - DAY

          Mary holds her cards close to her.

                         MARY
          "There are few things that are so
          unpardonably neglected in our
          country as poker." Guess who said
          that one.
          She looks around the table. The guys, except Angus, are
          starting to lose their patience.

                         MARY
          Mark Twain. And you know what else-

          BBC NEWS PHOTOGRAPHER
          Darling, you in or not?

                         MARY
          Sorry.
          Mary looks at her cards, thinks about it for way too long,
          then grabs a handful of coins from her Kroger bag, slaps them
          on the table.

                         MARY
          Send it, ladies!
          Steve steps into the tent, spots Mary, turns to run back out.

                         HARTMAN
          Don't go, Steve! Look who's here.
          Mary jumps up - just about knocks the table over, then
          sustains a number of injuries trying to leap over chairs. At
          last she makes it to Steve, hugs him.

                         MARY
          Thank God you're okay!

          He looks over her shoulder and mouths "you're dead" to
          Hartman.

                         TO
          He holds her back at arm's length, looks at her, goes
          speak then stops himself, pulls her outside the tent.

          EXT. MEDIA TENT - DAY

          Steve tries to stay calm talking to Mary.

                         STEVE
          You have to stop stalking me.

                         MARY
          I'm not. It's more like picking
          travel destinations based on where
          you happen to be working.

                         STEVE
          Stalking.

                         MARY
          Hartman told me you wanted me here.
          Now that I am, what better
          opportunity for us to get to know
          each other better.

                         STEVE
          This is crazy.

                         MARY
          Hartman said you'd say that.

                         STEVE
          Go home, Mary.

                         MARY
          And he said you'd say that too.
          It's just your fear talking.
          Steve just about loses it.

                         STEVE
          He's not my friend, he's not your
          friend. He's just an asshole who
          thinks it's fun to string you along
          and make my life hell.
          He yells toward the tent.

                         STEVE
          Hughes! Get out here!

          

          

          

          

          67.
          Mary looks right at him.

                         MARY
          You know how sometimes you see a
          pinguid (that means fat and greasy)
          guy with an attractive girl and you
          think how the heck did he pull that
          off? People won't think that when
          they look at us. We're perfectly
          matched.
          She can hardly contain her excitement.

                         STEVE

          HUGHES!
          Hartman peeks out of the tent.

                         HARTMAN
          For the hundredth time, Steve, no,
          I am not interested in a threesome
          with you and your new girlfriend.
          Steve points to Mary.

                         STEVE
          Tell her the truth. About all the
          crap you told her.

                         HARTMAN
          Okay. Fine.
          Hartman goes to Mary, grabs her hand.

                         HARTMAN
          Everything I said about Steve,
          about his feelings for you, his
          hopes, his dreams, his fears, his
          unexplainable odor, forget about
          it. Forget everything I said.
          None of it was true.
          Mary's stunned, devastated. She looks like she's going to
          cry. Hartman and Steve look at each other - what now?
          Hartman shoves him forward. Steve reluctantly puts a
          comforting hand on her shoulder.

                         HARTMAN
          Because nothing I said comes close
          to the enormity of Steve's real
          feelings for you!

          Mary perks up. Steve yanks his hand off her shoulder like
          it's on fire.

                         HARTMAN
          It's a love that defies words!
          Steve jumps him. Hartman fights back. Mary's horrified.

                         MARY
          Stop it, you guys! Stop! "Victory
          attained by violence is tantamount
          to a defeat, for it is momentary."
          You know who said that? Gandhi.
          And me. Just now.
          The fight continues. Mary half covers her eyes.

          No! This isn't about money! It's
          about courage, love, honor and all
          things virtuous and pure. Steve,
          kick him in the leberknoedel!
          Hartman looks up at her, hurt. The distraction costs him.
          Steve knees him then follows with a jab to his face.

                         JOURNALISTS
          Ohhhh!
          Hartman drops to his knees, tries to pull himself together.

                         STEVE
          Tell her!

                         HARTMAN
          Okay, alright.
          Hartman wipes his lip, looks up at Mary.

                         HARTMAN
          Mary, millions of people believe
          what I tell them every night. Why
          shouldn't you?
          Steve dives at him. Hartman swings and gets him right in the
          nose. One of their cell phones ring, then another, then all
          the guys' phones go off.

                         ANGUS
          Verdict's in.
          They all rush off to the court house, leaving a stunned Mary
          standing alone.

          The camera is knocked out of position as Mary rushes Steve.
          Angus steps in and pulls her away. A COP grabs her.
          Mary looks back to Steve as she's dragged back to the fan

          Angus hangs up the phone, hands it back to Steve.

          In here. So loud. Always

          Suddenly, Mary spots Hartman, Steve and Angus rush past. She
          breaks away from Clyde, rushes along the fence to catch up.

          Considering you probably just cost

          But I do! If you're in trouble
          because of me I can fix it, I can
          explain to your boss. He or she
          probably just doesn't understand

          to express themselves properly, but
          even I, with my plenitudinous

          I got him in trouble, Dad. I have

          There's three places they could be
          headed.
          She pulls a note pad out of her pocket, looks it over.

          For each story, I've worked out an

          I rest my case! If you gave up the
          first time dad said no then I
          wouldn't exist. Telling me to give
          up so soon on my potential husband-
          to-be, birth father of my twelve

          of my gerbil Carol -- you might as
          well be saying that you wish you
          had given up too and that you never

          Torrential rain pelts the line of vehicles heading north.
          The only movement in the southbound lanes -- Howard's car.

          EXT. GALVESTON WATERFRONT - DAY

          In full rain gear, Hartman walks past rows of boarded up
          businesses. Steve follows him with the camera. Angus, Doug
          and Josh are close behind.
          The rain is deafening, the wind ridiculous. It's all Hartman
          can do to stay on his feet.

                         HARTMAN
          (yelling his head off)
          And this time, the warnings were
          hard to ignore. One Galvestonian
          told us "tornados, we can handle.
          Hurricanes we can handle. Bugs we
          can handle. Put 'em all together
          and that's a storm I don't need to
          see". A wise man indeed.
          Something off to the side catches Hartman's eye -- it's a
          picnic table blowing down the street.

                         HARTMAN
          Oooh! Get that!
          Steve gets the shot then pretends to make adjustments to his
          camera while he discretely scans the area, on the lookout for
          Mary.

          INT. HOWARD'S CAR ON 1-45 TO GALVESTON TX - DAY

          Howard and Mary can barely see out the window. The car
          inches along.
          Mary digs in a KFC bag, takes out a handy wipe, starts
          cleaning her body with it.

                         MARY
          And when I met Steve, I knew right
          away we had a lot in common. We're
          both in the media, we both love
          crosswords, we both love words. We
          both felt this unexplainable
          connection, no matter how much his
          instinct might be to fight it.
          That's okay. We just have to get
          to know each other better, that's
          all.
          She uses the wipe on her face, gets a bit on her lip and the
          taste is awful. She rolls down the window, closes her eyes
          and gently sticks her face out to rinse with rain water.
          The car hits a flooded patch of the road. A wave of mud
          washes up and smacks Mary right in the face.

                         MARY
          Crap.
          She starts the handy wipe bath all over again. A nervous
          Howard speaks up.

                         HOWARD
          I saw Steve talking to you... He
          wasn't very nice.
          Mary makes herself busy putting the handy wipe in her Kroger
          bag then looks out the window.

                         MARY
          If there's one thing I learned from
          crossword puzzles it's that you
          can't give up.

          MARY (cont'd)
          Sometimes you run into a doozy and
          you think you'll never be able to
          solve it in a million years. If
          you quit, you're right, but if you
          stick with it, you'll figure it
          out. Eventually.
          She looks at Howard.

                         MARY
          I have to give it one more try. I
          have to fix the mess I made with
          his work, then maybe he and I --
          For the first time, she doesn't seem so sure. Howard
          notices.

                         HOWARD
          You know what my favorite part of
          doing crosswords is? When you know
          something you didn't think you
          knew.
          Mary thinks about it, then turns back to looking out the
          window.

                         MARY
          Me too.

          EXT. GALVESTON PIER - DAY

          Hartman stands in the middle of a pier that looks moments
          away from being carried out to sea. Steve shoots from a spot
          on the pier a few feet closer to shore but not much safer.

                         HARTMAN
          Paula, this pier was closed to the
          public twenty-four hours ago, and
          for good reason.
          Steve inches a bit closer for the shot, his footing unstable.
          Josh moves in and hangs on to Steve to keep him steady.

                         HARTMAN
          As I stand here, I can actually
          feel the structure moving under my
          feet. The only thing between me
          and the limitless depths of the sea
          is this two-by-four railing that -
          The railing flies off. Hartman drops to his knees and crawls
          to the other railing then hangs on for dear life. Steve and
          Josh struggle to hang on to the camera and each other.

          

          

          

          

          81.
          Steve signals,to Hartman to wrap it up fast. Hartman talks
          slower than ever.

                         HARTMAN
          And Paula I have to tell you, not
          only has my hearing been
          permanently damaged by the sheer
          force of the rain hitting my
          eardrums, but at this point, I'm
          beginning to wonder if I'll even
          make it out alive.
          He raises his head up for the big finish, gets hammered by
          the wind and rain.

                         HARTMAN
          This is Hartman Hughes, reporting
          live from Galveston, Texas.
          Steve and Josh start backing up off the pier with Hartman
          crawling behind them. Steve yells back to him.

                         STEVE
          You had to get the pier shot. Had
          to. Just about got us all killed.
          Happy?
          Hartman points in the water, yells.

                         HARTMAN

          OH MY GOD! IT'S MARY!
          Steve jumps, looks to where Hartman is pointing -- it's a
          plastic bag floating by in the water.

                         STEVE
          You're such an asshole.
          Steve walks off the pier mad as hell.

                         HARTMAN
          Come on, that was funny. You have
          to admit... Stevie?

          INT. HOWARD'S CAR ON

          Howard stares out the window, the first look of real fear on
          his face.

                         HOWARD
          Hang on.
          He hits the brakes, starts backing up as quickly as possible.
          Mary looks ahead -- sees what looks like a tornado up ahead.

                         MARY
          Oh my God.
          Howard backs under an overpass, points to a protected area up
          the cement embankment.

          EXT. 1-45 OVERPASS - DAY

          Mary and Howard run up the cement embankment as the rain and
          winds swirl all around them.

                         HOWARD
          We'll just have to wait for this to
          pass, then we'll keep going. It'll
          be okay.
          They look down to the road just in time to see Howard's car
          picked up and blown right through the underpass, landing on
          its side in a ditch fifty yards away.

                         MARY

          Steve awakens in panic.

          GO AWAY, GO AWAY, GO AWAY!

          Steve looks at the person in front of him -- it's a scared
          year old MEXICAN BOY.

                         STEVE
          Who the hell are you? What are you
          doing?

          MEXICAN BOY
          They pay me twenty dollar to wake
          you.
          Steve looks outside the van, sees Doug and Hartman laughing
          hard. The Kid scurries out of the van. Angus gets in, opens
          up his laptop.

                         STEVE
          You seen her?

                         ANGUS
          She's too smart to come here during

          No, she's here somewhere. I can
          feel it.

          EXT. 1--45 OVERPASS - NIGHT

          As the storm calms around them, Howard and an exhausted Mary
          crouch in the sheltered area. They use a little flashlight
          on Mary's keychain to watch debris blowing by.

                         MARY
          I spy with my little eye a chemical
          element from group two of the
          periodic table.

          Howard points to a discarded fireworks casing at their feet.

          She barely has the energy to get the word out.

                         MARY
          Cobalt.
          Mary points to a steel belted tire on the ground, lays back
          and shuts her eyes. Howard takes something out of his - it's a
          pocket, puts it in her hand. Mary looks at it
          shrivelled, sculpted apple head. She smiles, hardly able to
          keep her eyes open.

                         MARY
          Mother Teresa.

                         HOWARD
          My best seller. I'm an apple
          sculptor.
          She's quiet for once. Howard watches her drift off.

                         HOWARD
          I went to school for physics but got
          bored. Now I just make these and
          sell them on appleheadsrule.com. I
          was going to give that one to my
          girlfriend in Bangor but I can make
          her another one. She'd probably
          prefer a Stephen Hawking one anyway.
          Science is her life. Not like my

          into Jesus. Same as my other
          girlfriend in Duluth.
          He waits for a response - nothing.

                         HOWARD
          Maybe I'll meet them in person one
          day. They're just so far away and
          I don't get out much, not farther
          than the apple orchard or the post
          office anyway.

                         MARY
          But you're out now.
          He's a bit surprised she was listening.

          I saw the people on TV fighting for
          Baby Peggy. It wasn't far from my
          house, and the people there looked
          nice enough, so I went. I thought
          I had everything I needed at home
          but then I thought, maybe there's
          more.

                         MARY
          Maybe there is.

                         HOWARD
          Can I tell you something?
          Mary nods.

                         HOWARD
          I like your eyeballs.

          pissed off FAIR PATRONS.
          At the edge of the fair grounds, the ferris wheel casts a
          shadow over the rescue site. The whole area has been
          overtaken by RESCUERS and their equipment. POLICE guard the
          tape to keep ONLOOKERS back. Local MEDIA circulates.
          Hartman kneels at the back of the ambulance, holding the hand
          of one of the Teachers. Steve gets it on camera, all the
          while looking around, a bit paranoid.

                         HARTMAN
          And what went through your mind
          when you realized they were gone?
          The Teacher just bawls. Hartman turns to the camera.

                         HARTMAN
          Grief too strong for words. That's
          the best way to describe this
          tragic, tragic scene. One minute,
          a merry day at the fair. The next
          minute, helpless babes savagely
          sucked into the menacing abyss.
          The Teacher bawls even harder. Hartman gives her a "there
          there" then continues talking to camera.

                         HARTMAN
          And here's how hopeless the rescue
          looks at this moment. The earth
          surrounding hole is far too
          perilous for anybody to approach on
          foot. Moving heavy rescue
          equipment in too close could mean
          death for the rescuers as well.
          Its cold down there, wet, dark,
          probably a few snakes and rats
          moving around.

          If the hearing impaired children
          even survived the fall, they're
          undoubtedly dealing with serious
          injuries, although some may have
          had their fall cushioned by their
          deaf brothers and sisters who
          dropped before them. Nevertheless,
          they've got to be in complete
          misery. Even if one them is
          telling the next "it'll be okay",
          it's not like he, or she, can hear
          a word of it.

          Rescuers keep a safe distance from the perilous hole. A
          RESCUE SUPERVISOR oversees the effort, watches as a bucket is
          attached to the old crane, barely big enough for one person.
          A FIREMAN gets in the bucket, doesn't fit. He gets out. A
          SKINNY FIREMAN is pushed forward. He gets in.
          The bucket is lowered into the ground. Hartman jumps in
          front of the scene. Steve follows with the camera.

                         HARTMAN
          To some, a simple crane. To the
          trapped, innocent, special children
          -- the answer to their prayers.

          EXT. TRI-PARISH FAIR GROUNDS

          As all the other Journalists scramble, Hartman and Steve are
          a bit stunned. Angus joins them, puts his phone on speaker.

          CORBITT (O.S.)
          Shame about your girlfriend in the
          pit, Steve, but we've got the
          inside advantage here so let's use
          it.
          Steve shakes his head, not impressed.
          Angus takes the phone off speaker, steps aside to talk to
          Corbitt. Steve's phone rings. He answers it, listens,
          cringes.

                         STEVE

          Mrs. Horowitz cries into the phone.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          We're coming! Tell her to hang on!
          Mr. Horowitz runs down the stairs with luggage and Carol the
          gerbil.

          EXT. TRI-PARISH FAIR GROUNDS - MEDIA CAMP -- DAY

          Steve listens to the phone and glares at Hartman.

                         STEVE
          You and your husband stay put, Mrs.
          Horowitz.

          She'll be fine. I promise.
          He hangs up, looks at Hartman.

                         STEVE
          She better be.
          Hartman looks away, guilty.

          INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

          Complete darkness. Mary's voice full of misery.

                         MARY
          Eight letter word for... my life
          has come to this.
          There's a bit of shuffling around in the dark.

                         MARY
          Not destiny, that's only seven
          letters. Not fortuity - that
          sounds more like when good things
          happen to people like finding a
          quarter in the sofa or something.
          I mean the not so great stuff
          that's bound to befall some people
          more than others. Fate's nasty
          cousin, I mean.
          Suddenly Mary's face lights up with her mini keychain
          flashlight.

                         MARY
          F-O-R-E-D-0-0-M. Foredoom.

                         A
          Mary shines the light on her knee. Her previous cut is now
          gaping wound, blood is all over the place.

          EXT. TRI-PARISH FAIR GROUNDS

          Near the hole, the Rescue Supervisor consults with the other
          rescuers and a MINE SAFETY EXPERT.

          RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          The new equipment is going to take
          a while. Let's try and find out
          what kind of shape our victim's in.

                         RESCUER
          Can we lower a phone down in there?

          MINE SAFETY EXPERT
          Not at those depths, this whole
          area is bad enough above ground.
          We'll never get a signal down
          there.

          RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          Let's keep it simple. Get me a
          flashlight, a piece of paper and a
          pencil.
          An unenthusiastic Hartman steps in front of the camera, the
          Rescuers in the shot behind him. Doug films. Hartman goes
          to speak but can't seem to summon his on air personality.

                         HARTMAN
          Behind inc... Oh what's the point?
          Hartman walks away moping.

          EXT. TRI-PARISH FAIR GROUNDS - MEDIA CAMP - DAY

          Steve paces. Angus hangs up the phone.

                         ANGUS
          Corbitt wants you to go on air to
          talk about Mary. An interview with
          the boyfriend.

                         STEVE
          I'm not her boyfriend!

                         ANGUS
          Close enough. Come on, we need
          this.
          Hartman steps up, listens in.

          

          

          

          

          98.

                         ANGUS
          Fox has already got their hands on
          everything but her panty size.

                         HARTMAN
          Fox scooped us? Our Mary? The
          bastards.
          Steve glares at him.

          A RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR comments as a graphic shows the
          cross section of the mine. As he talks, the graphic animates
          with a female figure in red boots tumbling into the mine and
          bouncing off the walls all the way down -- and it plays over
          and over.

          RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR
          That area was never reinforced up
          above, no need since the whole
          eastern tunnel was blocked off in
          the late Seventies. Of course that
          would also affect the air quality
          down there.

                         ANCHOR
          That has to be bad news for Mary
          Horowitz, wouldn't you say?

          RETIRED MINE SUPERVISOR
          Definitely not looking good.

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY

          Mr. Horowitz snaps the TV off, furious and worried.
          An upset Mrs. Horowitz cracks open the curtains, looks
          outside.

          MRS. HOROWITZ
          Who are these people?

          INT. HOROWITZ HOUSE - DAY

          A slick, young JOURNALIST stands on the sidewalk in front of
          the Horowitz house.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          SLICK JOURNALIST
          Mary Horowitz, described by those
          who know her as smart, talkative,
          very much the girl next door, that
          is, if the girl next door has a
          genius level IQ. She's worked for
          eleven years as the crossword
          constructor for the Atlanta Citizen
          and lives right here with her
          parents.
          Mr. Horowitz opens the door an is swarmed by Reporters. The
          Slick Journalist gets right in there.

          MR. HOROWITZ
          No, Mary doesn't live with us. She
          just came over one day and won't
          leave, but she has her own place.

          SLICK JOURNALIST
          Can you comment on the rumors that
          Mary's fall into the mine was a
          suicide attempt?

          MR. HOROWITZ
          That's ridiculous. Not our Mary.
          The word depression isn't in her
          vocabulary. Well, it's in her
          vocabulary, obviously, but no,
          nothing ever gets her down. Steady
          as a rock, that one.

          INT. MINE SHAFT - DAY

          Mary shines her light around on the walls of the mine. Black
          soot everywhere, a mine track, abandoned equipment.

                         MARY
          I am not afraid. I am not fearful,
          pusillanimous, nor am I affrighted.
          Suddenly in the light - a face. Mary screams her head off.
          The face doesn't budge - it's a LITTLE DEAF GIRL.

                         MARY
          Oh my God, they forgot one! You
          scared the crap out of me.
          The girl just stares at her.

          

          

          

          

          100.

                         MARY
          I'm sorry, can you hear me, I mean
          at all? Do you have sensorineural
          hearing loss or conductive? "Deaf
          people can do anything except
          hear." You know who said that?
          Doctor Jordan, first deaf President
          of Gallaudet U. Maybe you'll go
          there one day. That is, unless we
          perish down here.
          Mary smiles. The Little Deaf Girl just stares back.

          A YOUNG RESCUER arrives with the flashlight, pencil and
          paper.

          YOUNG RESCUER
          What should we say?

          RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          Tell her help is on the way. We
          just need her to confirm she's
          conscious -- here, give me that.
          The Supervisor grabs the paper and pencil, scribbles the
          note, ties it to the flashlight.
          They look up to the thin nylon rope now in place of the
          snapped cable. The Rescue Supervisor signals for them to
          drop it. He attaches the flashlight/note, waves to the crane
          op.
          The crane swings over, lowers the rope into the hole.

          rope. Mary grabs the flashlight, turns it on, reads the
          note.

          At the hole, the crane reels in the rope, swings it away from
          the hole. They see the note attached, flashlight gone.

          RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          That's a good sign right there.
          The Young Rescuer grabs the note.

          What's it say?

                         UNFOLDS
          The rescue team gathers around. The Young Rescuer
          the note, reads it slowly and loudly.

          YOUNG RESCUER
          "I think you mean, am i conscious,
          not am I conscience."

          RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          Jesus Christ.

          YOUNG RESCUER
          "Conscious means alert and awake.
          Conscience is your inner morality
          gauge, you know, the thing that
          stops you from doing bad things,
          e.g. killing, stealing, harming
          helpless animals, and whatnot."

          RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          Can we leave her down there?
          He motions for the Rescuer to continue.

          YOUNG RESCUER
          "To answer your question, yes I am
          conscious. My leg is bleeding but
          I'll probably live."

           RESCUE SUPERVISOR
          Great.

          YOUNG RESCUER
          "Yours truly, Mary Horowitz."
          The other rescuers start to disperse.

          looking at as much as sixteen hours
          to bring the other one in.

          Sixteen hours? If we've got carbon
          monoxide -

          There's air coming in through the

          Even at a concentration of 5ppm,

          ground for heroes. Jimmy Carter,
          Hank Aaron, Ryan Seacrest and
          now... Mary Horowitz. As the
          country wonders about what would
          drive this woman to such an
          extraordinary act, we went straight
          to those closest to her.

          NERVOUS OLD LADY
          Mary Horowitz was one of my second
          grade students. Brilliant girl...
          Darling. Always a smart dresser as
          I remember. And she once brought
          me soup when I wasn't well.

          Mary Horowitz, a hero who's devoted
          her life to caring for the sick and
          elderly. Clearly a woman with a

          FEMALE REPORTER
          Exactly like the boots worn by Mary
          Horowitz when she slipped into the
          mine. Were the boots responsible
          for the accident? The manufacturer
          refuses to comment. For now, the
          deadly footwear remains on store
          shelves, leaving consumers to pay
          the ultimate price.

          I knew Mary Horowitz in college.
          She caught me trying to cheat off
          her physics midterm, lectured me
          for an hour and when she finally
          stopped talking I asked her out.
          She said no, said it was because I
          was, get this - hebetudinous. Can
          you believe?
          He walks away, bitter, gets back to work on NASA rockets.

          We dated for a while but she ended
          it. Said she couldn't stand this -
          He points around 'to the library - you could hear a pin drop.

                         RESEARCHER

          fiance struggling for her life at
          the bottom of the abandoned mine as
          we speak.
          Steve glares at him. Hartman motions for him to go on.

                         STEVE
          Mary... she's smart, incredibly
          smart. She talks a lot. Never
          boring, I'll tell you that much.
          He thinks about her, gets lost in it.

                         STEVE
          Mary Horowitz doesn't pretend to be
          anything she's not. She's
          passionate, beautiful, real... and
          she definitely doesn't deserve to
          be where she is now.

          An ELDERLY COUPLE hands Howard and Elizabeth candles. Howard
          looks around at the rest of the crowd - strangers watching,
          waiting, worried.

                         HOWARD
          They don't even know her.

          ELDERLY LADY
          No, but they know what it's like to
          be alone, to need a helping hand.
          That's a good enough reason to be
          here.

          Happenstance, I love that word too.
          And you know what else -
          Mary coughs. Before she has a chance to catch her breath, a
          rope with a small bag attached quickly drops next to her, the
          bag hitting the floor. Mary unties the bag and looks inside
          to find water and sandwiches.

                         MARY
          No dessert. Crappy. Did you know
          that the word dessert comes from an
          old French word that means "clear
          the table"? Sometimes I feel like
          dinner is just doing time so I can
          get to the point, and of course the
          point always involves sugar. Who
          needs -
          The Little Deaf Girl covers her ears, vocalizes as much as
          she's able.

          LITTLE DEAF GIRL
          Shut up! I can't hear you but you
          talk a lot.
          Totally catches Mary off guard. She fully takes that in.
          Her demeanor completely shifts, a calm washes over her.,

                         MARY
          I know.
          She sits down.

                         MARY
          I know.
          She notices the Little Girl's shoes are soaked. Mary moves
          next to her, takes off her rubber boots and puts them on the
          Little Girl. Mary puts an arm around her, holds her close at
          - softly,
          her side, then speaks like she's a different person
          to herself, the Little Girl unable to read her lips.

                         MARY
          I'm not good at... silence. "Mary
          doesn't do quiet", that's how my
          grandmother always said it.
          "What's that hush?" she'd holler at
          a party. "It's Mary about to
          talk", then she'd laugh and laugh
          and laugh. Everybody would... But
          I knew something they didn't - that
          if you keep talking, if you keep on
          talking, you don't hear people
          telling you that you're different.
          You don't hear people saying they
          don't like you. And if you're
          talking, you just might not hear it
          when some kid... calls you a freak.
          Mary's eyes start to well.

          

          

          

          

                         MARY
          I just wanted to be normal, that's
          all. Steve said I was.
          She thinks about it, laughs a bit.

                         MARY
          I'm beginning to think newsmen
          can't entirely be trusted.
          She buttons up the Little Girl's sweater.

                         MARY
          The truth is normal is -- not me.
          She seems surprised she said it out loud. There's relief in
          it.

                         MARY
          My friends, the people I've met
          over the past week, they're not
          normal either. They're more
          interesting, more original, more
          real, more rare.
          She suddenly gets it, brightens up.

                         MARY
          That's where I fit.
          - and for
          She thinks about it, in silence. The sadness fades
          the first time, she's comfortably quiet.
          She smiles at the Little Deaf Girl. The Little Deaf Girl
          smiles back. And they sit -- Mary totally calm.
          Mary hears something in the distance - a gentle PLINK PLINK
          PLINK she couldn't have heard while talking.
          She picks up the flashlight, moves toward the noise. In a
          corner of the mine, a water drip hits on some old rusted
          mining tools, including two rusty vice grips.
          The Little Girl coughs. Mary looks back at her, concerned.

                         MARY
          Little Deaf Girl, it's time for us
          to go home.

          Until then, all we can do is wait,

          There's a commotion at the rescue site. Doug zooms in.

          Mary motions for the Little Deaf Girl to jump on piggyback.
          She jumps up onto Mary's back, still in the red rubber boots.
          Mary starts jugging up the rope, the vice grips and rope
          pieces acting like ladder steps.
          They start rising up slowly. Not an easy task. Mary

          MARY (V.0.)
          My brain is full of all kinds of
          information, some of it useful,
          some of it not.

          117.
          MARY (V.0.) (cont'd)
          I've recently discovered, hiding in
          the back of my mind, somewhere
          between astrophysics and a catalog
          of candy bars of the Seventies, a
          previously hidden bit of knowledge
          more important than everything
          else. It is this...

          INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

          Mary sits right at the front talking to the female BUS

          DRIVER.

                         MARY
          In solving the puzzle of life
          there's one thing you must do.
          She points to the side of the road. The bus pulls over.

                         MARY
          Find somebody just as normal as
          you.
          Mary stands up, gets off the bus.

                         MARY
          if not a whole bunch.
          Howard, Elizabeth, George, Lydia, Carlos, Clyde, a few old
          Ladies, a bunch of other Protestors file off the bus. Mary
          keeps talking to the bus driver.

                         MARY
          And don't be a slave to your loins.
          Trust me on that one.
          Mary taps the side of her head.

                         MARY
          You need to let this be the boss of
          you. Cornprende ?

          EXT. MARY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - ATLANTA - DAY

          A huge gated property. Mary opens the gate and walks up a
          tree covered path, Howard right behind her, all the other
          Protestors following. For once, Mary isn't doing all the
          talking.

                         HOWARD
          That bus driver looked like Francis
          Galton. Did you see that?

          

          

          

          

          118.

                         MARY
          He's my favorite behavioral
          geneticist in the world.
          They continue on through an open yard.

                         HOWARD
          In retrospect, and I say this with
          some hesitation because I don't
          like to have actual regrets so I'll
          just say I'm beginning to perpend -

                         MARY
          Good one.

                         HOWARD
          I'm beginning to perpend whether or
          not eating three bags of caramel
          corn for lunch was the smartest
          thing to do. Honestly I'm this
          close to spewing...
          Mary reaches the end of the path and stops, waits for
          everybody else to catch up. They're in complete awe of the
          monstrous Georgian estate before them.

                         MARY
          My grandma left it to me. My
          parents won't stay here. And for
          me it was always too... quiet.
          She looks at her new friends.

                         MARY
          Not anymore.
          They head toward the house.



                        THE END
