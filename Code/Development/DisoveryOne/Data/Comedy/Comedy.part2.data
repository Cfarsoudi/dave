                                                             10/16/09
          EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
                         
          A HOMELESS MAN, who from his tatty suit may have been a top
          broker this time last year, is picking through a bin in
          Manhattan's deserted night-time financial district.
                         
          The street starts to vibrate. A TERRIFYING GROWL approaches.
                         
          A huge black shape smashes into view - THE DARK KNIGHT'S
          BATMOBILE! Our audience wonder if they've wandered into the
          wrong movie. The Homeless Man dives for cover.
                         
          BAM! The Batmobile smashes into a row of parked cars.
                         
          We hear manic laughing from inside the car, which screeches
          and careers violently into a sign reading `WALL STREET'.
                         
          Sirens herald THREE POLICE CARS in hot pursuit.
                         
          The Batmobile roars up Wall Street, bashing against the New
          York Stock Exchange, thumping up and down the Federal Hall's
          steps and finally smashing at high speed into the rear end of
          the famous 'Charging Bull' statue. Two enormous bronze
          testicles thud onto the Batmobile's bonnet and roll away.
                         
          The cop cars screech up, surrounding the Batmobile. TWO OLDER
          COPS and A ROOKIE surround it, weapons drawn.
                         
          A HELICOPTER appears, blazing the Batmobile in white light.
                         
                          ROOKIE COP
           Cooool.
                         
          An older Cop flashes the rookie a dirty look, then points a
          FLASHLIGHT into a tiny window. THE BATMAN - actually drunken
          English socialite ARTHUR BACH TEMPLEMEAD in a costume -
          lowers the window and offers a handshake.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Evening, Constable!
                         
                          OLDER COP 1
           (seen it all before)
           Hi, Arthur.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Are you familiar with the
           expression `I can explain
           everything'?
                         
                          OLDER COP 1
           Out of the car, please.
           2.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Terribly sorry, but in the film
           they used a different model to show
           the old Batchap getting in and out.
           This one has no doors, so I'd have
           to squeeze out the back arsehole
           first. Which nobody wants...
                          (TO COP 2)
           Apart from you, cheeky monkey!
                          (BEAT)
           It's a joke! Okay, okay.
                         
          Arthur wriggles awkwardly out of a rear hatch. The bronze
          bull teeters, a little scarily. He stands, wobbly. His Batman
          utility belt features a big water pistol, a firework, a hip
          flask and line of shot glasses. And, inexplicably, a big red
          stapler. The younger cop is desperately fighting the giggles.
                         
                          OLDER COP 1
           Okay, explain everything.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Well. What with having spunked 1.6
           million fat Alberts on this little
           runaround, I thought why not take
           it a step further and try to
           actually collar a few ne-er do
           wells? It worked for the
           billionaire Bruce Wayne, why not
           the future billionaire Arthur Bach-
           Templemead? Will I have to do
           traffic school?
                         
                          OLDER COP 2
           How much have you drunk, Arthur?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           To use the technical medical term -
           megabloodyshitloads. Either that or
           I've had a stroke! But fret not, I
           have a designated driver.
                         
          The cop shines his flashlight back inside, revealing A
          BEARDED HOMELESS OLD MAN IN A CRAPPY 60S `ROBIN' costume.
                         
                          HOMELESS ROBIN
           Where's my five thousand dollars?
                         
          Arthur counts out a huge wad of cash.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The Boy Homeless here neglected to
           say he'd never driven.
                          (MORE)
           3.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Or that the only reason he's sober
           is to be ready for the conspiracy
           of leopards about to seize
           Manhattan.
                         
                          HOMELESS ROBIN
           It's LIZARDS! English prick!
                         
          Arthur hands another wad of cash to Cop 1.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I trust this will cover all repairs
           to New York and any inconvenience
           to your good selves?
                         
          He turns and tries to get back in.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Up up and away! Ah, no, that's the
           other chap.
                         
          The bronze bull collapses fully, crushing the Batmobile.
                         
                         
          INT. 23RD PRECINCT. CELL - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          Arthur sits, minus mask, in a cell with Homeless Robin and
          VARIOUS CRIMINALS and DRUNKS, including A HUGE GUY IN A
          CHICAGO CUBS SHIRT, sporting a terrifically swollen eye.
                         
          JAY, a drunk with a bandaged neck, is ranting away at Arthur,
          who's paying close attention, genuinely fascinated. Cash
          sticks out of various pockets.
                         
                          JAY
           Then the crazy motherfucker cut me!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Goodness. Why?
                         
                          JAY
           Said I cut the bombita with pig
           killer!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Rude man. And who threw hot
           Americano in whose face again?
                         
                          JAY
           I did in his. No half and half
           neither. That shit burnt!
                         
          Jay laughs hard, as does GARY, another crook. Arthur, out of
          politeness, tries to join in the laughter.
           4.
                         
                         
                          GARY
           I burnt my sister's hair.
                         
                          JAY
           (high fiving him)
           Cool...
                         
                          GARY
           Ho wanted to evict me, just 'cause
           I don't fit her definition of
           hygiene. Plenty of places to take a
           shit, toilet's just one of them.
           Just ask the a-rabs.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's like a chat show, this.
           (looking into an imaginary
                          CAMERA)
           It's been said of my next guest, by
           Jay the bandaged lunatic, that
           she's `a sick-ass, whacked-out,
           whacked-up asswipe'.
           (to a PROSTITUTE)
           Carmella, when did you first dream
           of becoming a crack whore?
                         
                          PROSTITUTE
           Mother died when I was six.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Oh G-d, I hate when that happens.
                         
                          PROSTITUTE
           My father raped me when I was
           twelve.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sounds like you had six relatively
           good years.
                         
                          JAY
           What do you do?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I model riding boots, I spend
           money, I sleep with women. But I
           have weekends off and I am my own
           boss.
                         
          The cell door swings open.
                         
                          OLDER COP 1
           Hey, The Drunk Knight. Your Fairy G-
           d-lawyer's here.
           5.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (STANDING)
           I never thought New York's
           underbelly could be quite such
           agreeable company. I shall never
           forget you. Farewell.
                         
          The crooks look back at him sulkily. Arthur looks guilty.
                         
                         
          INT. 23RD PRECINCT. CORRIDOR. NIGHT - LATER
                         
          Arthur's attorney ELVERTON DEVERE is leaving with him.
                         
                          DEVERE
           I don't think your mother will be
           pleased, Arthur.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Really, Elverton - if a chap can't
           help out a few chums, whatever
           their station in life.
                         
          The other crooks from the cell are leaving alongside them.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Each has given his or her word to
           put the criminal life behind them.
                         
                         
          EXT. 23RD PRECINCT. NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Arthur steps into a blaze of paparazzi flashes.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I am the Batman. Gotham can sleep
           easy tonight.
                         
                          JAY
           (points at A CAMERAMAN)
           Don't point that shit at me, bitch!
           I will FUCK YOU UP!
                         
          Jay attacks the cameraman violently. Gary piles in.
                         
                          HOMELESS ROBIN
           Yes! Yes! Kill the lizards!
                         
          Arthur pushes past the press.
                         
                          PRESS
           Arthur! What will your mother say?
           Didn't she send you here to get you
           out of the British papers? Arthur!
           6.
                         
                         
          He turns to those crooks who aren't fighting.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Anyone need a job? My last driver
           resigned after I filled his limo
           with squirrels. Preferably sober,
           clean driving licence?
                         
          The crooks all look unsure. Apart from one....
                         
                         TITLES
                         
                         
          EXT. MANHATTAN- NIGHT
                         
          A different, extremely flashy car zips through Central Park,
          the back full of released crooks, the huge Chicago guy - his
          name's MARTY - at the wheel.
                         
          The car passes A MALE JOGGER. It stops and backs up. Arthur
          opens a door and beckons the jogger, offering champagne. The
          jogger gets in. The car sets off again.
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           Anyone know a good bar?
                         
                         
          EXT. CLUB - NIGHT
                         
          The car pulls up outside a very rough-looking dive club. Out
          falls Arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne
          bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys. Following him are
          his crook friends, the jogger, TWO MIDDLE-AGED TOURISTS and A
          DANCING MAN in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `CHEAP
          APARTMENT RENTALS!'
                         
          Like the pied piper, Arthur leads his disciples into the bar.
                         
           JUMP CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. BAR - LATER
                         
          Arthur staggers out, leading a bigger crowd! (IN A CONGA?)
          He's even more drunk, arm in arm with Carmella the prostitute
          and a very attractive young woman, SOFIA. He produces A BIG
          ROCKET.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Stand back!
                         
          He releases the firework; it flies at a crazy drunk angle,
          people screaming and diving for cover. It explodes into a
          shop sign reading `CHECKS CASHED'.

                          (LAUGHING)
           Oh, man. Nobody tell you about the
           recession?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The what?
                         
                         
          EXT. MANHATTAN - NIGHT
                         
          A very long line of excited people stand at an ATM, Arthur at
          the front.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Roll up, roll up, folks, let's fix
           this thing right now.
           (to his first customer)
           How much, sir?
                         
                          FIRST MAN
           Um. $800 please.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Coming right up.
           (keys it in)
           Fries with that?
                         
          The man laughs, along with others in the line, including
          Sofia who catches his eye.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Congratulations everyone! THE
           RECESSION'S OVER!
                         
          Arthur dials a number on his gold iPhone.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Pierre? Arthur Bach-Templemead. Can
           you squeeze me in for a little
           snack? Yeah, just me and a couple
           of mates.
                         
                         
          INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The Maitre D' enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find
          the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people, so there's
          standing room only. People are even sitting on tables. It's a
          very eclectic mix of people.
                         
          An angry, stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit
          horrified at the center.

          Arthur's flanked by Carmella the prostitute and Sofia from
          the ATM line.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Pierre! We'd like 182 pate de foie
           gras, 182 chateaubriand steaks, a
           motherlode of chips and your entire
           wine cellar please.
                         
          The daughter of the stuffy couple - she's ERICA - speaks.
                         
                          ERICA
           Arthur?
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (TAKEN ABACK)
           Erica? Fancy meeting you here!
           Er...Everybody, this is Erica - the
           very best friend forever of my
           girlfriend Susan. And Erica's
           parents Ernest and Margaret.
           (to Erica and her parents)
           Are you familiar with the
           expression `I can't explain
           anything'?
                         
                          ERICA
           Who are the women with you, Arthur?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Oh, um, this is Sofia. I believe
           she works for Avis. Checks the cars
           for dings, dead people in the
           trunk, that sort of thing. And
           this is Carmella. Anyway...
                         
                          ERICA'S FATHER
           What do you do, Carmella?
                         
                          CARMELLA
           Whatever you want. But no
           penetration without a rubber.
                         
          It's all gone a bit tense.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Carmella's joking. She's actually
           a...queen. Of a very small country.
                         
                          ERICA'S FATHER
           Is she now?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's terribly small.

                          ERICA'S FATHER
           I see.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Rhode Island could beat the crap
           out of it in a war.
                         
                          ERICA'S FATHER
           Yes, it's a small place.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           85 cents in a cab from one end of
           the country to the other. I'm
           talking small.
                         
                          ERICA'S FATHER
           I think I understand how small it
           is.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Just had the entire country
           carpeted, this is not a big place.
                         
                          ERICA'S FATHER
           You need to grow up, Arthur.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           That's easy for you to say, you
           haven't got 50 pairs of short
           trousers hanging in your closet.
           Maybe we should go somewhere else.
                         
                          ERICA
           Maybe you should.
                         
          He gets out his ultra-exclusive Black Visa Card.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Could I have all those lobsters to
           go, please?
                         
                         
          EXT. PIERRE HOTEL - DAY
                         
          The bright dawn sun explodes on the windows of Arthur's
          castle-like $56 million penthouse atop the Pierre Hotel.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A huge jacuzzi is full of contented liberated lobsters,
          surrounded by the most amazing toy boat armada in history.
           10.
                         
                         
          We cut around the vast, opulent 20's apartment, scattered
          with unconscious revellers from last night. A mixture of old
          extravagance and modern excess, the place is stuffed with the
          toys of the boy who has everything:
                         
          An old gun cabinet is stacked with enormous water rifles.
                         
          A `Bodyworlds' plastinated corpse is posed, swinging from a
          chandelier, a bottle of champagne in its hand.
                         
          Damien Hurst's shark in formaldehyde is half out of its
          smashed tank, a REVELLER'S FEET protruding from its jaws.
                         
          Unconscious partygoers are slumped on plush seats in a home
          cinema themed to look like the set of `Roadrunner', while a
          screen plays episodes of the cartoon.
                         
          A naked couple lie in a sleeping embrace in a room converted
          entirely into a sandpit, complete with giant toys.
                         
          Big Chicago Marty, Arthur's new driver, lies on a big sofa,
          consulting his sports pager.
                         
          Homeless Robin is filling pans and antique vases with water.
                         
          A huge photo of Arthur modelling riding boots fills a wall,
          beside an old red London telephone box, converted into an
          aquarium, bubbling with colorful fish.

          SENSIBLE WOMAN'S SHOE steps over a reveller.

          Arthur and Sofia are in an even greater frenzy. The floating
          bed is wobbling scarily.

          The older woman enters the room carrying A PLASTIC TRAY AS
          USED AT AIRPORT SECURITY. This is JANE HOBSON, the British
          aristocracy's longest-serving nanny.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (brightly, as he humps)
           Morning, Hobson!
                         
          Unfazed, Hobson busies herself picking up Arthur's trousers,
          and emptying wallet, matchbooks, and iPhone into the tray.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Morning, Arthur.
                         
          She hits a remote. The curtains fly open. A HUGE TV flips on,
          showing news coverage of Arthur's antics last night.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           I'm afraid your impromptu stimulus
           package failed to reignite the

          Hobson's reading a text on Arthur's phone: `So excited ur

           (noticing Sofia's stopped
           having sex with him)
           Why are you stopping? Oh, sorry.
           How impolite of me. Sofia, this is
           Hobson, my nanny.

                          HOBSON
           He's merely shaped like an adult.
                         
                          SOFIA
           Is she going to stay here?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson, could you come back in a
           minute and a half please?
                         
                          HOBSON
           Negative. You're seeing your mother
           this morning.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Nobody told me.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Actually I did, on the other side
           of the vast moat of champagne known
           as `last night'.
                         
          Hobson picks up Sofia's panties and bra from the floor like a
          crime scene officer.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           I wouldn't recommend letting him
           get used to your breasts, dear.
           Addictive personality. He was at
           mine until he was six.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson! Really...
                         
                          HOBSON
           I had to dab Tabasco sauce on the
           nipples to see him off...
                         
                          SOFIA
           I can't do this.
                         
          She pulls away from Arthur, grabs her clothes and jumps out
          of bed, nearly tipping Arthur out.
           13.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           I support your decision 100%. Will
           you be requiring a taxi, or just be
           getting in a random passing car?
                         
          Sofia storms to the door, clutching her clothes. Arthur can
          see other revellers being removed by HOTEL SECURITY.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           Say goodbye to your new friends,
           Arthur. They have to go back to the
           recession now.
                         
          Arthur covers his head with the sheet.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Cancel my mother please, Hobson.
           I'll work from bed today.
                         
          But Hobson hits a touch-sensitive screen on the wall. The
          magnetic bed thuds to the ground. She taps another control.
                         
          MUSIC: HORRIBLE, DEAFENING DEATH METAL
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Not the death metal, please!
                         
                          HOBSON
           (shouting over the music)
           Aren't you a fan of Carcass?
                         
          Hobson reads off an album cover in a little wall screen.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           `Vomited Anal Tract' is surely a
           classic of its genre.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           OKAY, OKAY, I'LL GET UP!
                         
          Arthur sits up. Hobson stops the music.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Good boy.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm going for a shower.
                         
                          HOBSON
           I'll alert the media.
           14.
                         
                         
          EXT. BALCONY SHOWER - DAY
                         
          Arthur stands naked in his shower - a big glass cube jutting
          out from the balcony like something from a David Blaine
          stunt. Hot jets of water are blasted from holes in the cube's
          ceiling. Arthur can see Manhattan far beneath his bare feet
          as he showers.
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (SINGING)
           To Bombay, a travelling circus
           came...
                         
          Arthur grabs a pair of binoculars which hang on a hook.
                         
                          HOBSON
           They brought an intelligent
           elephant and Nellie was her
           name...Hobson!
                         
          We see Hobson on a little screen inset into the glass wall.
          She's on a phone at Arthur's computer.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Female Tom Hanks!
                         
                         
          INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hobson - in front of an Ebay screen full of purchases - picks
          up her own pair of binoculars and looks down.
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           Heading east towards Park Avenue.
                         
          Through Hobson's binoculars we see A MIDDLE-AGED
          BUSINESSWOMAN who does look vaguely like a female Tom Hanks!
                         
                          HOBSON
           She's early today...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Can we invite her up and dress her
           as Forrest Gump?
                         
                          HOBSON
           No.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Just for a laugh! We'll pay her.
                         
                          HOBSON

          INT. SHOWER - DAY
                         
          Arthur's still peering down through his binoculars.
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           Hobson! That was your birthday
           present! You like bears!

          Hobson glances up at Arthur, washing himself on the screen.
                         
                          HOBSON
           That reminds me, clean your
           genitals. Heaven knows what
           wildlife that girl was harbouring
           between her thighs.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S DOJO. DAY - LATER
                         
          Arthur, in expensive baggy yoga pants and collarless shirt,
          is doing self-invented yoga to Indian `meditation' music.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I give you `Sideways farting
           spider'.
                         
          Hobson is sitting, exasperated, going through various
          expenditures.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur, you have to stop giving
           money away!

                          HOBSON
           With the emphasis on the `pissed'.
           Really, what is it about unearned
           wealth that brings out such idiocy
           in those who have it and those who
           want it? The way you're going,
           you'll have spent your inheritance
           before you've inherited it.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (shifts to new pose)

                          HOBSON

                          ARTHUR
           What kind of yoga teacher won't let
           a pupil invent positions? She was

          EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY
                         
          Arthur and Hobson are in a huge Bentley. Marty's at the
          wheel, still in his Cubs shirt but sporting a chauffeur's cap
          and tie. As he drives, he checks a bleeping sports pager. He
          nearly hits a pedestrian, then goes back to the pager.
                         
                          MARTY
           Sorry, fellas.
                         
                          HOBSON
                          (CONSPIRATORIAL)
           You don't seriously intend to keep
           employing this gentleman?

                          ARTHUR
           Give the guy a chance, Hobson. He
           got laid off in Chicago...
                         
                          HOBSON
           But he doesn't know his way around
           New York!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           So? I want interesting, fun people
           around me, not drones who just get
           the job done...
                         
          Arthur sees something out of the window.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Marty! Stop the car!
                         
          Marty hits the brakes, pitching Arthur and Hobson forward.
                         
                         
          EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur hurries up to A SMALL GROUP OF TOURISTS.
                         
           WOMAN (O.S.)
           The Chrysler Building. Designed by
           William Van Allen...
                         
          A TOUR GUIDE wearing a name badge reading `Naomi' is talking.
          She is gorgeous, wearing vintage clothes, clutching a
          clipboard. We understand why Arthur stopped the car.
                         
                          NAOMI
           ...and inspired by the machine age
           of the 1920s, this magnificent
           structure was the world's tallest
           building for 11 months before the
           Empire State stole its thunder.
                         
          She looks out on her sullen, miserable tourists.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           The Chrysler got its name when the
           builder went bust in the 1928
           Cement Famine and had to melt down
           his Chrysler to make the pointy bit
           at the top. If you peer closely you
           can still make out remnants of a
           hub cap and a sticker reading `Honk
           twice if you voted Hoover.'
                         
          Some tourists laugh. Some don't. Arthur's transfixed.
           18.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           That was a joke, folks. It was
           built for the Chrysler corporation.
                         
          Naomi shares an eye roll with A NEWSSTAND GUY who's clearly
          in love with her.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           The spire is a beauty, especially
           on a winter's morning when the sun
           hits it and it just seems to...
                         
           GRUMPY FEMALE TOURIST
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           How tall is it?
                         
                          NAOMI
           1047 feet madam, not allowing for
           pigeon shit. Okay, let's cross.
                         
          Naomi leads the tourists across the busy road. She has to go
          back to grab a teenager in the headphones, who didn't hear.
          Arthur hurries alongside Naomi.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Can I join your tour please?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Sure. It's $15, plus $5 for the
           free authentic street pretzel.
           Sorry, my bosses make the prices.
                         
          Arthur produces his wallet full of high-end credit cards.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Sorry. I can't take cards.
                          (BEAT)
           Ah, owe me it. I start on that
           corner every day on the hour...
                         
          Just as Naomi's reaching the other side, a cabbie, driving
          very aggressively, nearly hits her.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Hey, you big blind jerk! Doesn't
           your braille windshield work?
                         
                          CABBIE
                          (ANGRY)
           !NO ME HINCHAN LAS PELOTAS!
           19.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI

           ENORMA Y SU PADRE NO TIENE NINGUIN
           MARTILLO!
                         
          The cabbie's shocked - but laughs and blows Naomi a kiss. She
          smiles back.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Wow. What did you say?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Just generalised criticism of his
           parents and genitals.
           (to the tourists)
           Everyone make it over alive?
           Excellent. Next we enter Times
           Square, world famous for New Year's
           Eve, when a Waterford Crystal Ball
           descends at eye-poppingly slow
           speed for the inexplicable
           entertainment of a million drunk
           fools. Many people think the square
           is actually a square, despite
           blatant evidence otherwise.
                          (TO ARTHUR)
           Sir? What shape is Times Square?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           A circle?
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (LAUGHS)
           See? Morons.
                         
          More tourists laugh this time. Some...
                         
           GRUMPY MALE TOURIST
           When do we get the pretzel?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Soon, sir. Soon.
                         
          She checks her watch and leads the party inside a laundromat.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Okay, next the very Laundromat once
           used by George Gershwin, Donald
           Trump...
           20.
                         
                         
          INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Naomi approaches a washing machine just as it ends its cycle
          and makes a loud buzz.
                         
                          NAOMI
           ...Mr Big from Sex and the City and
           three of the 9-11 terrorists.
                         
          She starts unloading the machine of a large man's whites -
          vests, underwear, shirts, all stained red by a baseball cap.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Oh, dad.
                         
          She transfers the laundry into a tumble dryer and feeds it
          quarters. Arthur stays close.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           The Welsh poet Dylan Thomas drank
           himself to death at the Chelsea
           Hotel half an hour after losing a
           sock in this very dryer.
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (CONSPIRATORIAL)
           Are you abusing this tour to do
           your errands?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Are you abusing the tour to stalk
           me?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Absolutely.
                         
          Arthur stares at the big tumble dryers.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           These things are amazing. Have you
           ever put all your father's clothes
           on and just got inside one?
                         
          Naomi looks at him, bemused but intrigued as she heads to the
          door.
                         
                         
          EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY
                         
          Hobson's out of the car looking for Arthur.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Where the blazes is that boy?
           Arthur!
           21.
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They emerge into the street.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Ahead, the jewel in Manhattan's
           crown, the Empire State Building.
           This iconic symbol of American
           corporate might was adapted during
           World War 2 in case of attack from
           enemy forces. At three minutes'
           notice the entire structure can
           retract into the ground like a
           tortoise's head.
                         
                          TOURIST
           That's not possible. I should know,
           I'm a civil engineer.
                         
                          NAOMI
           You're not being very civil to me.
                         
          Some tourists laugh.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The building doesn't retract; the
           ground rises up.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Exactly. The ground rises up! Thank
           you, sir.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           They were going to install giant
           legs so if a plane was flying at
           the tower it could run away. But
           where's it going to run?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Manhattan's in the way.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It'd have to jump in the Hudson.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Victory to the Nazis. Is that what
           you want?
                         
          The group approaches a pretzel stand.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Okay, folks, your pretzel awaits.
                         
          The group lines up to get their pretzels.
           22.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Do I know you from somewhere?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           If you go on Perez Hilton or TMZ.
                         
                          NAOMI
           What are they?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The gossip websites.
                         
                          NAOMI
           That the internet? Ah, my
           computer's too old for all that.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           For the internet? Seriously?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Life's too short for all this
           obsessive upgrading.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You consider the internet an
           upgrade? Wow.
                         
                          NAOMI
           So why do people gossip about you?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Ah, that was a joke. I'm nobody.
                         
          Arthur feels a tap on his shoulder. Hobson.
                         
                          HOBSON
           You're late for your mother!
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (TO ARTHUR)
           Sorry, this pretzel stand is a
           watering hole for the crazies.
           (raises her voice to
                          HOBSON)
           The soup kitchen's just up and to
           the left, honey.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson, this is...
           (reads her badge)
           Naomi.
                         
                          NAOMI
           She's with you?
           23.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           Delighted to meet you, Naomi.
           Normally one has to go to a bowling
           alley to meet a woman of your
           stature.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Ooh, Grandma's got jokes.
                         
                          HOBSON
           You aren't the first woman who
           walks the streets this young man
           has asked.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Who's this? Joan Rivers' older
           bitterer sister?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           My nanny.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Obviously. Seriously, who is she?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           My nanny. Well, she started as
           that, but these days she's more of
           an all-round enforcer and
           bodyguard.
                         
          Naomi looks at her watch and glances to the tourists, chewing
          on their pretzels. She starts to walk away.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Sorry, I have to get out the cattle
           prod and haul ass. Got another tour
           starting in eight minutes.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Can I call you?
                         
          Naomi starts to walk away.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I don't give my number to grown men
           with nannies. But as you may not be
           a grown man, it's 917 476 2030.
                         
          Manhattan swallows the lovely stranger.

          INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          They cross a huge foyer, passing a big sign reading
          `TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS INC' to the elevator.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But what if this is the one?
                         
                          HOBSON
           This is just like the Komodo
           dragon. Everyone else is happy to
           see one in the zoo and leave it
           there. You had to own one. Thank
           goodness that handbag manufacturer
           was prepared to take the poor
           lizard away.
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (HORRIFIED)
           You said he's in London Zoo!
                         
                          HOBSON
           He is, Arthur. Are you the only one
           allowed to joke now?
                         
                         
          INT. TEMPLEMEAD HOLDINGS. RECEPTION AREA - DAY
                         
          Reception is manned by GRANT, a too-cool-for-school, young
          Aryan beefcake straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch spread.
          Arthur and Hobson enter.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I don't like it here.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Of course you don't. People work
           here.
                         
                          GRANT
                          (HATES ARTHUR)
           Good afternoon, Mr Bach-Templemead.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hi Grant. Tell me - which of your
           parents are you most like?
           Abercrombie or Fitch?
                         
                          GRANT
           (doesn't get the joke)
           I have no connection with that
           store. My family name is Von
           Krausehoff. Take a seat please.
           25.
                         
                         
          Arthur and Hobson sit down. Grant picks up a phone.
                         
                          GRANT (CONT'D)
           Vivienne?
           (conspiratorial, flirty)
           White mid-rise briefs...mmmm.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Don't fret, Arthur. This won't take
           long. Then we'll have ice cream.
                         
          A LARGE OFFICE DOOR opens spookily of its own accord.
                         
           VIVIENNE (O.S.)
           Come in, Arthur.
                         
          Arthur heads to the door. VIVIENNE BACH-TEMPLEMEAD a
          formidable, tanned American widow in her sixties, shakes his
          hand.
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
           Arthur.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Vivienne.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           You know I prefer `mother'.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm sorry. You look more like a
           Vivienne.
                         
          Vivienne nods to Hobson as the door to her lair shuts. An icy
          breeze passes between biological mother and surrogate.
                         
                         
          INT. VIVIENNE'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and
          framed photos of Vivienne's younger self showjumping and
          holding trophies aloft. There's one small photo of Vivienne,
          Arthur's late father GERALD and Arthur as a toddler.
                         
          Vivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations. Arthur,
          clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her.

           So. How are you, Arthur?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Quite busy. I have a riding boot
           shoot for Petrie Dressage...
           26.
                         
                         
          But Vivienne's buried in her work, not listening.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           What else...I'm meeting Ivanka
           Trump for brunch to discuss the
           environment. She's sending her
           helicopter to avoid the traffic...
                         
          Vivienne's still not listening.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Crashed my Batmobile into the
           bronze bull on Wall Street...
                         
          She's still not listening. Has it always been like this?
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           ...which caused a hole to swallow
           up the New York Stock Exchange...
                         
          She's still not listening.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           ..the world economy to collapse and
           the planet to descend into looting
           and cannibalism.
                         
          Still not listening.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           What else? Um...tripped over in the
           shower this morning. Head split
           open, found a family of meerkats
           hiding in there! Hated the thought
           of the little lads being homeless
           so I bricked up the remaining half
           of my brain, popped them back in
           and Hobson glued my skull back
           together.
                         
          Still not listening.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           I'm thinking of buying a giant. I
           think the market's right for it.
                         
          Arthur stops. He watches Vivienne. He lets out a huge belch.
          Nothing. A big fart. Nothing. Opera. Nothing.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           You really are a shoddy mother.
                         
          Vivienne eventually looks up.
           27.
                         
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Did I hear you say you were meeting
           Ivanka Trump for brunch? That's
           nice. Right. Today we're going to
           have a friendly chat. Then a
           serious talk. And lastly make a
           timetable. How does all that sound?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Amazing. Do you have any vodka?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           What happened, Arthur? You were
           such a sweet baby.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I still wake up in my own poo
           occasionally.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Right, that's it for the chat. Time
           to transition to our talk.
                         
          Vivienne hits a remote control. A large wall-mounted screen
          fills with a changing collage of him drunk, dancing, puking,
          making out with women, beside countless news headlines.
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
           This insanity has to end, Arthur.
           As the delightful coffee-coloured
           gentleman who runs this country
           said, `The time has come to set
           aside childish things.'
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Can't Hobson set them aside for me?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Susan is a splendid girl. Her feet
           are on the ground, she's of fine
           stock...
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (GETS UP)
           Oh. That's what this is all about.
           I'm not marrying Susan. I don't
           love her.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           And? You think I spent my marriage
           to your father skipping through
           meadows?
           28.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
          Not after you ran him over in the
          Bentley, no. Susan's boring. She's
          not funny.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          Ditto your father. The aristocracy
          doesn't marry for `fun', Arthur.
          It's about stability. Continuity...
                         
                          ARTHUR
          ...and sinking your fangs into
          Susan's father's bank account.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          The Johnson family's considerable
          equity in a stormy financial period
          is merely a side issue. Burt is a
          pillar of the community.
                         
                          ARTHUR
          His baby formula was taken off the
          market in six African countries!
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          A completely innocent error in
          places where there's precious
          little for children to live for
          anyway. The families all got gift
          baskets as compensation. That
          little bump in the road aside, Burt
          is a devout Christian.
                         
                          ARTHUR
          Yes, because they're never insane.
          And where did he get Jesus?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
                          (GETTING EXASPERATED)
          Burt paid his debt to society years
          ago.
                         
                          ARTHUR
          He strangled a fireman! Who
          strangles a fireman?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          Arthur...
           29.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
          I'm sorry, Vivienne. I've met
          someone else very lovely who, as
          far as I know, isn't related to
          anyone who would kill an unsung
          hero in cold blood.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          Un-meet her. Arthur, you're the end
          of our line. We need an heir.
                         
                          ARTHUR
          I nearly gave you an heir!
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          Oh, give me strength! A Bach-
          Templemead having a child by a lap
          dancer called `Mystery'?
                         
                          ARTHUR
          That was just her stage name! To
          give her more mystery when
          she...waved her fanny around. Her
          real name was...what was it again?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          Susan is 33 this year. Her egg
          inventory has dropped by 23% since
          you met her. You risk having no
          sons, or worse, some pea-brained
          hunchback who hugs everyone!
                         
                          ARTHUR
          Great! I like hugs! And some of
          them are really good at math.
           (heading to the door)
          You know the `Frog and Toad' books?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          No.
                         
                          ARTHUR
          Of course you don't. Hobson read
          them to me while you were off
          riding horses over stripey poles.
          They're about fun and friendship,
          not how many unspasticated tadpoles
          I can squirt up a rich girl.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
          Your father would turn in his grave
          to hear this nonsense...
           30.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           That I won't follow in his
           footsteps and marry a woman I hate?
           I think he might climb out of the
           grave and dance on it.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Suit yourself.
                         
          Vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier.
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
           My will, which I have updated to
           designate Grant in reception as the
           sole beneficiary.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You wouldn't! You're my...
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           ...Vivienne? Try me.
                         
          Vivienne opens a draw and takes out A HUGE RING BOX.
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
           Shall we segue to the timetable
           part of our meeting?
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          The liberated lobsters are now living happily at the bottom
          of the London phone box aquarium. Arthur eats lunch alone at
          a huge table, THE BIGGEST DIAMOND RING IN THE WORLD is beside
          him. Hobson brings a plate of vitamins.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Ah. The ring your father gave your
           mother, I recall.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (feeling its huge weight)
           Did he knock her out with it, then
           drive her to the church in the
           trunk of his Bentley?
                         
                          HOBSON
           No. Your father was a gentleman.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What's gentlemanly about dying
           before I knew him? That's just
           rude. Did he ever love my mother?
           31.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           They had their days.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Ah well. At least he doesn't have
           to wake up every day to a woman
           with a face like saran wrap
           stretched over a gargoyle.
                         
          Arthur stares at the ring again.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           What about Naomi?
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur. I say this with love:
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Uh-oh...
                         
                          HOBSON
           Even by modern male standards
           you're a breathtakingly immature
           little shit. Coupled with the kind
           of money you have access to, that's
           deadly. Susan may not have a four
           hour stand up routine about the
           Flatiron Building, but she's a
           solid girl who will look after you.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I have you for that.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Not forever.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Yes forever. You're Hobson.

          Naomi answers a giant old cellphone in her modest apartment,
          cooking for her dad, RALPH, a bear of a man slumped in front
          of the TV watching CSI. A picture of Naomi and her elderly
          mother, in hospital, is on the wall.

           I'm sorry, I've never really
           understood that question. Are you
           free tomorrow night?

          Arthur's on the toilet in a bathroom whose walls are entirely
          covered in a photographic mural to make it look like he's
          sitting at the top of a ski slope, with skis on his feet.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Is that a euphemism for something
           naughty?
                         
                          NAOMI
           No, it's a lie. I have a creative
           writing class. Tonight?
                         
          Arthur glances down at the ring box on the floor.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I have a contractual commitment.
           Friday?
                         
                          NAOMI
           You got it.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Paper.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Sorry?
                         
          A voice-activated toilet paper dispenser spits out a sheet.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sorry, I was talking to something
           else. So. What do you want to do?
           33.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Naomi dishes out the food on cheap plates. It's all a big
          contrast to Arthur's setting.
                         
                          NAOMI
           A movie?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Movie? Come on, you've got to try
           harder than that.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Pizza.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What have you always wanted to do?
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's a first date, Arthur. Not our
           honeymoon.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Every date will be our honeymoon.

           Ewww. Okay, uh, picnic in the
           park...or dinner with a view. I
           like views.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Arthur's standing at a sink. A list is beside him, reading
          `Picnic in park, movie, dinner, view.'
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What sort of food do you like?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Anything but guts and mushrooms.
           Okay, enough questions.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Oh come on. This all helps build up
           a profile of you before I trick you
           into my basement. I'd hate to not
           have your favourite snacks ready.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Turkey Jerky and Pez. Are we done?

          The line goes dead. Hobson is standing behind Arthur, the
          ripped out phone cord in her hand.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Time to get engaged, Arthur. The

          EXT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT
                         
          The original Delorean from `Back to the Future' putters up to
          Burt Johnson's imposing, tacky mansion. The car stops and the
          gull wing door swings up, revealing an extremely drunk
          Arthur, clutching a bottle of champagne.

          AN EXTREMELY STIFF, MISERABLE OLD BUTLER answers.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hi! Is it June 19th at 7 pm?
                         
                          BUTLER
           No, sir. It's 8.34.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           FUCK! We overshot! Time travel can
           be a real cunt sometimes, don't you
           think? I'll be right back. See you
           in an hour and a half ago...
                         
          The butler doesn't laugh.
                         
                         
          INT. BURT'S STUDY - DAY - LATER
                         
          Arthur and the butler enter the large, paneled study.
                         
                          BUTLER
           Would you care for anything while
           you wait?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           A trampoline and a selection of
           woodland creatures if that's not
           too much trouble.
                         
          The butler leaves. Arthur gazes around the room, which is
          filled with antique Christian iconography. The ceiling fan is
          in the shape of a cross. A large, scary Jesus statue, palms
          outstretched, stares at him from beside a fish tank.
                         
          He sees a cocktail cabinet.
           35.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Ah!
                          (TO JESUS)
           Shhhhh...
                         
          He opens the cabinet. Nothing but bottles of water.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Bollocks.
                          (TO JESUS)
           Sorry. Actually, you couldn't,
           um....you know...
           (points to the water)
           ...turn this into a nice 1990
           Romanee Conti, could you?
                         
          He sips the water as if it's wine. Lifts it to Jesus.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Cheers ears.
                         
          He checks out a huge, very old, rusty sword on the wall.
          Beneath it is a small information plaque.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           `Genuine Sword of the First
           Crusade. Excavated Germany, 1972'.
                         
          He looks around, then reaches up and takes it off. It's VERY
          heavy and clanks to the ground, slamming his foot.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Jesus Fucking Christ!
                          (TO JESUS)
           Sorry. It's not like you shouted
           `Arthur Fucking Bach' when they
           pinned you up. Sorry. Sore subject.
                         
          Arthur lifts the sword again, brandishing and twirling it,
          making the noise of a Star Wars light sabre.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Feel the force, Luke.
                         
          He swings it in a full arc...CLUNK!
                         
          Arthur has decapitated Jesus! Where's the head? The door
          opens. BURT JOHNSON, a large, imposing man with a tiny
          crucifix around his neck, fills the doorway.
                         
                          BURT
           Arthur!
           36.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I, er, had a bit of food stuck in
           my teeth and couldn't find a
           toothpick.
                         
          Burt, unperturbed, takes the sword from Arthur.
                         
                          BURT
           Heck, this sword went through three
           crusades. Beheaded 1000 moslems.
           Nothing you can do to harm it.
                         
          Burt walks straight past headless Jesus to the water cabinet.
          Arthur looks around desperately for the head.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You don't, um, have anything
           stronger, do you?
                         
                          BURT
           Sparkling.
                         
          Arthur laughs nervously. But Burt's not joking.
                         
                          BURT (CONT'D)
           `The drunkard and the glutton shalt
           come to poverty: and drowsiness
           shalt clothe a man with rags.'
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Surely a glass of sherry at
           Christmas?
                         
          Burt clinks glasses with him.
                         
                          BURT
           Peace be with you.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           And also with me.
                         
          He sees Jesus's head! It's sitting on top of one of the
          blades of the ceiling fan!
                         
                          BURT
           Arthur. Can I be honest with you?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You're the real Slim Shady? I knew
           it!
           37.
                         
                         
                          BURT
           My faith teaches me to hate the
           sin, not the sinner. But with you,
           I struggle with that belief.
                         
          Burt turns away to get a glass of water.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You could switch to Judaism.
           (glances up at the fan)
           Bit warm in here. Do you mind if I
           put the fan on?
                         
          Arthur turns the fan on a low setting. It rotates slowly, the
          head going around with it. Burt turns away to pour more
          water. Arthur grabs the moment to speed up the fan again,
          until it's going fast enough and Jesus's head falls off.
          Arthur catches it. Arthur gets behind Burt, out of sight
          temporarily.
                         
                          BURT
           Anyway, Arthur. However I feel
           about you, my daughter loves you.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Yes, it's a problem, isn't it?
                         
          Arthur reaches out and, unseen by Burt, he reaches out of
          shot and puts the head back on Jesus's body.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Let's knock our heads together and
           find a way to stop her loving
           me....Got it! We'll tell her I'm on
           the sex offenders register....No, I
           am and she knows.
                          (BEAT)
           Joke, sorry. Ah. We'll say I'm gay!
           I did once dabble actually, so I
           can tell a plausible story.
                         
                          BURT
           You made love to a guy?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           One Moslem doesn't make a mosque,
           Burt.
                         
                          BURT
           You made love to a Moslem?
           38.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No, sir, it was Prince Alois of
           Lichtenstein and he made love to
           me. The fact that it took three
           bottles of poppers and a Jacuzzi
           full of Krug to loosen me up
           confirmed my heterosexuality.
                         
          Arthur notices that Jesus's head is on backwards.
                         
          Burt picks up a Bible from his desk and quotes from memory.
                         
                          BURT
           `If there is a man who lies with a
           male, they shall surely be put to
           death.'
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Crikey. Couldn't there just be some
           kind of on-the-spot fine?
                         
          Burt really hammers the table this time.
                         
                          BURT
           You will stop this talk and marry -
           my - fucking...
                         
          Jesus's head falls off. Arthur peers around. It's nowhere!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Oh bollocks.
                         
          Both Arthur and Burt see Jesus's head at the bottom of the
          fish tank. It floats back up to the top.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           It's a miracle! He is risen!
                         
          But SUSAN, Burt's beautiful daughter, enters with her best
          friend Erica - who Arthur met whilst at the restaurant the
          other night.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Hi Susan. Erica.
                         
          Burt looks from Jesus's head to the sword, figuring it out.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Sorry to make you wait, Arthur. I
           was talking to your mother. I hear
           you have something to ask me!
                         
          Arthur feels Burt's smiling face - and hating eyes - on him.
           39.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Shall we go?
                         
                         
          INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
                         
          A VERY PRECISE FRENCH WAITER performs the specials menu with
          ludicrous elan. Susan is rapt, taking it all very seriously.
                         
           WAITER (O.S.)
           ...the chef has bathed the bass in
           a parceline of Chilean fennel and
           finished him with a little gift of
           kobe beef. Also I have a
           progressive tasting of Kumamoto
           oysters en gelee which evolve on
           the palate, from light and
           refreshing to complex and spicy. A
           short story with a twist at the
           end! Le fin.
                         
          Susan chuckles approvingly, knowingly, the twit. She coos
          with delight and claps in appreciation.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Do you have something with less
           words please? The chef doesn't have
           to re-cook it, just scrape off the
           nouns and trim out all that
           gibberish in the middle.
                         
                          SUSAN
           He's just joshing, Dominic. I'll do
           the skate in wood ear mushroom.
                         
                          WAITER
           Excellent decision. Sir?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           A bowl of champagne and a spoon.
                         
          The waiter leaves, despising Arthur.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Arthur, did you really have to be
           so icky to Dominic?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm sorry. I just can't handle the
           whole specials act. It's not a
           Shakespearean soliloquy, it's some
           heated up dead things that aren't
           on the main menu.
           40.
                         
                         
          A WINE WAITER slams a bowl and spoon next to Arthur. He pours
          in champagne.
                         
                          SUSAN
           You know, I was grumbling to your
           mother about how things are with us
           sometimes. How I'm sure you're
           trying to drive me away...
                         
          Arthur slurps his champagne.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Um hm.
                         
                          SUSAN
           But she was explaining that
           relationships are like property
           purchases; invest only in high-end
           stock, avoid anyone 'up-and-
           coming', then hold onto the
           property through thick and thin to
           deliver maximum return! Isn't that
           darling?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Is it possible to buy the house but
           then rent it out? Sorry, joke. I'm
           not suggesting pimping you.
                         
          Arthur sees a very frail, rich old woman dripping in
          diamonds, passing by on her walking frame.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Look. You after our first child is
           born.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Arthur. Why can't you learn to
           laugh at genuinely amusing things?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Such as?
                         
                          SUSAN
           YouTube clips of babies giggling.
           Dane Cook.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Susan. Why are we together?
                         
                          SUSAN
           I love you, Arthur. And you love
           me, whatever you think.
           41.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           We don't have the same sense of
           humour. We don't like the same
           films, food, music. You like
           horses, I think they're arrogant
           idiots...
                         
                          SUSAN
           Don't they say opposites attract?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           That depends on the opposites.
           Racists and the Nation of Islam
           don't secretly want to 69 each
           other. Susan, you're beautiful.
           You're bright. You're fucking
           loaded. Is there really no one else
           who could make you happy?
                         
                          SUSAN
           No.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Never?
                         
                          SUSAN
           Well, I had a thing at college.
           That was serious for a while. But
           daddy...
                         
          She stops herself.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Daddy what? Prayed to Jesus for it
           not to work out, then shot the
           bloke behind a meat truck? Because
           Jesus would consider that cheating.
                         
          Susan places her hand on Arthur's.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Ask me, Arthur.
                         
          Arthur takes Susan's hand.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Susan. You're the only woman...at
           this table.
                         
          A waiter tops up Susan's wine. Arthur, now very drunk, holds
          out his champagne bowl to be refilled.
           42.
                         
                         
                          SUSAN
           You're not happy, Arthur. Nobody
           who drinks like you can be happy.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           How do you know? What if the
           drunker I get the better it is for
           me? Not everyone who drinks is a
           poet, Susan. Some of us drink
           because we're not poets.
                         
          The waiter arrives with Susan's fish and Arthur's drink.
                         
                          SUSAN
           A real woman could stop you from
           drinking.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It'd have to be a real big woman.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Ask me, Arthur.
                         
          Arthur sinks to his knees. Susan waits...and waits. Arthur
          has passed out. Susan kicks him awake. He fumbles away in the
          gloom, getting out the ring box and trying to get it on her
          finger.
                         
          At table level, Susan waits, irritated.
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           All done.
                         
          Susan pulls her hand up, and gazes at the huge, glinting
          diamond - pushed onto the end of her thumb.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Susan. Would you marry me? Take the
           weekend if you want...
                         
                          SUSAN
           Yes, I'll marry you.
                         
          She nods imperceptibly at the waiter.
                         
                          WAITER
           Ladies and gentleman - the happy
           couple!
                         
          Music starts. A congratulatory round of applause. Confetti is
          thrown. The whole restaurant cheers. Susan whips out her
          Blackberry and starts hitting keys.
           43.
                         
                         
                          SUSAN
           Erica will be the planner.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Erica? She hates me.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Who I love, she loves.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Oh, come on. She always looks like
           she wants to set fire to my face
           then put it out with an Uzi.
                         
          Susan's phone rings.
                         
                          SUSAN
                          (ANSWERING)
           Hello...thanks, daddy! Sorry, hang
           on, I have Erica calling...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What's going on? I only just bloody
           proposed!
                         
          Arthur's phone rings. The caller I.D reads `Vivienne'. He
          kills the call and sits, horrified, as the entire restaurant
          celebrates his grim fate.
                         
          INT. PIERRE HOTEL BASEMENT GARAGE - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          In the gloom we track past the crushed Batmobile, the
          Delorean and other famous cars, to find Arthur sitting in
          KITT from `Knight Rider'.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           What have I done, Kitt? This
           mistake's up there with Hitler
           joining his school debating team...
                         
                          VOICE (FEMALE)
           Go to bed, Arthur.
                         
          Arthur jumps out of his skin. But it's Hobson, standing by
          the car holding a dressing gown and a mug of cocoa.
                         
                          HOBSON
           And stop this self-pitying bibble.
           You're going to be fabulously rich.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Maybe I'd rather be fabulously
           poor. Some poor people I see look
           happy.
           44.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           That's either because they're far
           away or you've just given them
           money. Arthur, poor people have to
           work. They stand for hours in the
           rain, waiting for buses full of
           other poor people to take them to
           things called `jobs' which they do
           all year round to pay for holidays
           away from those jobs.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Don't patronise me. I have a job.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Lying drunk on a bale of hay in
           riding boots being photographed by
           another pampered prick won't
           prepare you for the work I mean.
           And I don't want to see you suffer.
           Take your fish oil.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT, QUEENS - NIGHT
                         
          A very old Apple Mac sits on a cluttered desk.
                         
          Ralph is in his chair, eating Popeye's Chicken n' Biscuits,
          watching CSI on an old TV with a tiny satellite dish on top.
                         
                          RALPH
           When are we getting cable?
                         
           NAOMI (O.S.)
           We have satellite.
                         
                          RALPH
           Honey, that's some bullshit aerial
           from the 99 cent Store!
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's a satellite dish!
                         
                          RALPH
           I read the box! It said `No
           satellite fees to pay because does
           not receive satellite signals!'
           That's like saying `Hey - eat this
           plate of broken glass! It won't
           make you fat. 'cause IT'S GLASS!'
                         
          Naomi comes in, looking absolutely beautiful. She checks her
          hair in the mirror.
           45.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's better than nothing.
                         
          Ralph unplugs the dish. The picture improves.
                         
                          RALPH
           No it ain't. Honey, I love you, but
           you're even cheaper than your mom.
           And she bought food from yard
           sales.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I miss her too, daddy. But now
           she's gone and if I'm going to keep
           you in grits and Oprah the rest of
           your life, you live by my rules.
                         
                          RALPH
           But you live like you're preparing
           for a war. And you earn a decent
           salary.
                         
                          NAOMI
           So? I want to know I can look after
           you.
                         
                          RALPH
           What's he do, this English bum?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Who cares? He's nice. He's funny.
                         
          On CSI, a female body is being unearthed.
                         
                          RALPH
           Yeah and I bet that girl said the
           same about her date. Honey, stay
           home. I don't want you ending up
           like that poor girl.
                         
                          NAOMI
           A bad actress holding her breath?
                         
          She changes the channel to something else.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Stop watching CSI.
                         
          A beep from outside. She kisses him and leaves.
                         
                         
          EXT. PARK - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur's Bentley pulls up at a quiet part of Battery Park.
           46.
                         
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           Sorry we drove around so long.
           Navigation isn't my driver's strong
           point.
                         
          There's a huge ding in one side of the car.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Or road awareness.
                         
                         
          INT. BENTLEY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Arthur and Naomi sit in the back of the car, while Marty
          checks sports results on his pager.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Can you put this on please?
                         
          Arthur's holding a blindfold.
                         
                          NAOMI
           On a first date? Are you crazy?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Trust me.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur. We're in Battery Park at
           night. I've met you once - in the
           company of your nanny. You make a
           disturbing number of jokes about
           stalking and basements. My dad
           already has you down as a mass
           murderer. And you want me to put on
           a blindfold?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I give you my word - if I kill and
           eat you, you'll never see me again.
                         
          She shrugs and puts on the blindfold.
                         
                         
          EXT. NIGHT - LATER
                         
          Arthur guides Naomi in the dark. She stumbles.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Okay, I'm officially a little
           worried.
                         
          She tries to pull her blindfold off.
           47.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (LAUGHING)
           Don't worry!
                         
          Arthur removes her blindfold. She's stunned to find herself
          on a huge blanket under a tree in a clearing lit by numerous
          candles. Before them is spread the most amazing picnic of all
          time. Flowers are everywhere. A log fire burns in a grate.
          Soft music plays.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           You said you wanted a picnic.
                         
          He pours them glasses of 1928 Krug.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur, I don't know what to say.
           It's beautiful.
                          (LOOKING AROUND)
           Who did all this?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The picnic fairies. Who liaised
           with the flower fairies, the candle
           fairies, the log fire fairies, the
           hidden sound system fairies...
                         
          He lifts a silver platter lid to reveal a vast pizza.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           ...and the pizza fairies.
                         
          A crack of a twig from somewhere.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Did you take account of the heroin
           fairies who hang here at night?
                         
          But there's nobody there. A cool breeze blows. Naomi shivers.
          Arthur uses a remote to turn the log fire flames up.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's nice to keep it simple like
           this. I'm sick of Michelin-star
           restaurants. All that embarrassing
           crap with the specials.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Are you kidding? Where I normally
           eat, the special's the one that
           comes with a free toy.
                         
          Arthur lifts a grill lid to turn over succulent steaks.
           48.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           You're rich rich, aren't you?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I get by.
                         
                          NAOMI
           `It doesn't remotely matter how
           much or what you spend it on' rich?
                         
          Arthur shrugs and swigs champagne, pouring more.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Craziest thing you ever bought?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I once inadvertently financed a
           terrorist cell who said they needed
           £100,000 to open a falafel stall.
                         
          She laughs. She stops laughing.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Oh my G-d, you're serious.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What's the craziest thing you ever
           told a tour party?
                         
                          NAOMI
           I once said the Manhattan we were
           in was actually a movie set built
           for `You've got Mail', but that
           after the film wrapped, everyone
           moved to the set because there was
           less crime.
                         
          A sudden, very loud, very out-of-date ring tone. Naomi takes
          out a huge ancient Motorola phone.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Yes, dad? There's a small Tiffany
           butter knife about two inches from
           his hand but it might take him
           eight months to dismember me with
           it.
                          (PHONE BLEEPS)
           Gotta go, battery. Love you too.
                         
          She ends the call.
           49.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Mom died last year. For eight
           months dad ate nothing but Popeye's
           Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
           CSI. So I persuaded him to move in
           with me. Where he eats Popeye's
           Chicken n' Biscuits in front of
           CSI.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sounds like you're very good to
           him.
                         
                          NAOMI
           What are you gonna do? All those
           years your folks tucked you in, did
           their best to stop you from eating
           crap in front of the TV. And then
           one day, you're the one saying `No,
           honey, it's bad for you! Go to
           bed.' Weird, huh?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (not relating at all)
           Yeah. I hate that.
           (looks at her phone)
           Nice bit of kitsch. Where did you
           find that?
                         
                          NAOMI
           AT&T store in 1998.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's...You've had it twelve years?
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's a fine phone. Battery life of
           eleven seconds, which cuts the crap
           right out of conversations.
                         
          Something weird is happening. The world wobbles imperceptibly
          as the background drops away. She hasn't noticed yet.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           I can't believe these mofos who
           gotta keep up with the latest
           bullshit. CDs come along, so out
           with the vinyl. Vinyl's back in,
           out with the CDs. I just kept the
           vinyl. Way cheaper, and I get to be
           incredibly hip once every 20
           years....
                         
          A beat. She looks around. And down.

           WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
                         
          Cutting wide, we see that the picnic was taking place on a
          grass covered platform with a tree planted in it - which is
          being lifted off the ground by a crane!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I couldn't decide between picnic in
           the park and dinner with a view. So
           it's a picnic in the sky! Isn't it
           ace?
                         
          The whole thing is rising higher and higher and higher.
                         
                          NAOMI
           No it is not ace, you crazy English
           bastard! This is dangerous!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Oh, sorry. Forgot. They said to put
           these on.
                         
          He pulls back the blanket to reveal seat belts. He straps her
          in.

          A gust of wind blows the structure, which swings. Naomi
          screams.

           Taste this truffle.
                         
          Naomi tastes it. It's clearly delicious. She gazes around as
          the crane swings them out over the Hudson. The view of
          Manhattan, of the river, of the Statue of Liberty, is mind
          bogglingly gorgeous from up here.
                         
          Naomi bursts out laughing. She sips champagne.

           right? At least it won't be years
           of pain like mom. Just a few
           seconds of screaming and falling
           with a truffle in my mouth.

                          (CALMING HERSELF)
           Okay, okay. Be deep. Breathe still.
           The tours are a temporary nine year
           fill-in until I'm drowned in a
           tsunami of apologies from everyone
           who failed to recognise my writing
           genius first time round.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What did you write?
                         
                          NAOMI
           A kids' book. I sent a chapter to a
           childrens' publisher. Sunshine
           Press'. The rejection letter was
           the meanest thing I ever read.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Kids can be so cruel...
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (INTERRUPTING)
           Arthur? We have a problem.
           52.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I told you, don't worry. These
           crane people know what they're
           doing!
                         
                          NAOMI
           Not that kind of problem.
                         
          Arthur feels a blade at his throat. He looks up to see A
          JUNKIE, CLEARLY HIGH, standing over him.
                         
                          JUNKIE
           Phone. And the watch. Hurry.
                         
          Arthur hands him his phone and watch.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Um. Out of interest, how did you
           get up here?
                         
                          JUNKIE
           What you talkin' about, dog?
                         
          We see a sleeping bag and needles behind the tree!
                         
                          NAOMI
           Great. `Picnic in the sky' followed
           by `Robbed in the sky'!
                         
          Arthur get the giggles as the junkie reaches into his pocket
          for his wallet. Naomi gets involuntary giggles too.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           This isn't funny, you lunatic.
                         
          The junkie stuffs his face with food, swigs champagne from
          the bottle, then walks away. Phew. Then...
                         
           ARTHUR AND NAOMI
           NOOOO!
                         
          The junkie's walking towards the edge, oblivious! Arthur
          jumps up, causing the platform to wobble scarily. He grabs
          the junkie's arm. The junkie swipes, cutting Arthur's hand.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           OWWW! You don't understand! We're
           180 feet up in the sky!
                         
                          JUNKIE
                          (LAUGHS)
           You on the same shit as me, yeah?
           Good stuff, right?
           53.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No, we're not high! Well we are,
           but only in the literal sense.
                         
          The junkie hurries away again. He's about to walk off the
          edge. Arthur runs and grabs him. They end up in a messy
          struggle, the platform rocking badly.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                          (TO NAOMI)
           Hit the panic button! It's next to
           the truffle station!
                         
          Naomi's panicking, searching desperately. Arthur and the
          junkie roll over the posh food, right to the edge!
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Hurry!
                         
                          NAOMI
           I can't find it. Over here?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No! That's the bouquet of world
           hams!
                         
          Naomi finds the truffle station and hits the panic button.
          Down in a Crane Cab an alarm goes off. The driver starts to
          lower the platform.
                         
          Naomi tries to help Arthur as he struggles with the junkie,
          but she gets slashed on the ear. She screams.
                         
          As the platform lowers, it swings back over the river to the
          land and tips them all into the river!

          INT. ARTHUR'S CAR - NIGHT
                         
          Naomi and Arthur - his face bruised - are sitting in the car,
          both dripping wet. Naomi's ear and Arthur's hand are
          bandaged.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I had fun tonight.
                         
          She stares at him as if he's utterly crazy.

          INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE - BALLROOM DAY
                         
          The room has started to fill with groom's paraphernalia -
          morning suits, top hats, shoes. Erica is sitting with a huge
          sheaf of wedding admin and brochures. Vivienne, Burt and
          Susan listen attentively, studying seating plans. It all
          feels more like a council of war than a wedding preparation.

          ARTHUR'S lying on a chaise longue, hungover. A TAILOR
          stretches a tape measure along him as if measuring a corpse.

          Hobson brings Arthur a glass of water and two Nurofen.

          A 3-d layout of the church appears on a laptop. In the mock

          computerised guests, many labelled with famous names.

          Arthur groans and leans over a bowl.

          stands with it accidentally-on-purpose, very close to

          The Hudson is bare of craft....until, suddenly, a bizarre
          mini submarine shaped like a dolphin, dives out of the water
          in an arc. Arthur and Naomi are laughing inside it - until
          they almost collide with a Circle Tour boat full of tourists.

          He's a bit drunk, wobbly on his feet, a little morose.

           That one was on the news. Everyone
           else recalled them, the pussies.
           Not my 99 Cent!
                         
          Arthur turns the doll over: a sticker reads `China'.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Maybe China's trying to wipe out
           the west's children one by one.
                         
          He gazes around in wonder.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Oh, I love this place.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Why?
           58.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           Well, I'd like you to believe it's
           because I'm a poor girl reduced to
           buying `Depressed Chef' burgers-in-
           a-can to Right Said Fred because I
           don't know where my next paycheck
           is coming from. But the truth is -
           bargains get me hot. Got it from
           ma. Drives my dad crazy. The tour?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Yes please.
                         
          She takes his arm.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Looking west, the ladies' hygiene
           products. Note that the more
           natural-sounding the name, e.g.
           this 'Vermont Breeze' Feminine
           Spray, the more lethal chemicals it
           contains. Watch out for the
           products cunningly labelled to make
           the dumber consumer think they're
           getting the real thing: 'Special
           J', 'Crampbell's Soup', ''Aunt
           Janina's' Maple-Style Syrup...
                         
          Arthur holds a tin with a Coffee Mate-style logo, reading
          `Friend of Coffee'.
                         
          The store music changes to RICKY MARTIN: `LIVIN' LA VIDA
                         LOCA'
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           And ah, the music: Dated sounds for
           lonely people to buy cheap shit to.
                         
          They pass AN OLD WOMAN who is going through a stack of
          identical tins of cheap beans.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           I once watched a woman shoplift an
           8-pack of toilet scrubbers down her
           panty hose to 'Everything I do, I
           do it for you'.
                         
          Arthur just stares at Naomi.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Why are you staring at me?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Just fascinated.
           59.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           You're good at fascinated.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You're good at fascinating.
                         
          A CRASH. The old woman has knocked over all the beans.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Are you okay? Let me help you.
                         
          He hands her a tin.
                         
                          OLD WOMAN
           Not that one.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (offers her another)
           This one?
                         
                          OLD WOMAN
           (shaking the tin)
           No. There's less beans in it.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           This one?
                         
                          OLD WOMAN
           (sniffs the tin)
           No.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           This one?
                         
          She stares and thinks. Arthur puts the tin to his ear.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           No. I think I hear a mouse inside.
                         
          Arthur shakes and sniffs another tin.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Oh my G-d. This is a good one. No
           rodents. Packed.
                         
          He slips her a dollar and whispers to her.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Quick, before someone gets it.
                         
          Naomi gazes at a different Arthur to the fool who nearly got
          her killed.
           60.
                         
                         
                          OLD WOMAN
                          (TO NAOMI)
           You got a good one here, honey.
                         
          She hurries away.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Look. Us in a year's time.
                         
          ANOTHER OLD COUPLE push a cart past. THE OLD WOMAN sneezes.
          The old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           If you got ill, I'd care for you.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I'll get ill.
                         
          The music changes.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Oh, man, Phil Collins. Gotta get
           out when they start playing Phil
           Collins. Want to see how to get a
           quarter from a shopping cart?
                         
                         
          INT. HIGH END RESTAURANT - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur, Susan and Erica - her laptop open - are at dinner.
          Hobson's salting Arthur's soup, then checking the
          temperature.
                         
                          ERICA
           Tiger Woods has confirmed!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I didn't know you knew him.
                         
                          SUSAN
           I don't.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Why is he coming?
                         
                          SUSAN
           He agreed to daddy's fee. This is
           going to be the happiest day of my
           life!
                         
          She looks at Hobson.
                         
                          SUSAN (CONT'D)
           Why is she here all the time?
           61.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           If you can bring Erica, I can bring
           Hobson.
                         
                          SUSAN
           She's my wedding planner.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           She's my Hobson.
                         
          Hobson leans into Arthur while tidying his napkin.
                         
                          HOBSON
                          (WHISPERING)
           Tell Naomi. That's an order.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
                         
          Arthur's giving stunned Naomi a tour of the huge apartment.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Reminiscent of a French castle
           perched 500 feet above New York,
           the penthouse was known from early
           days as the `Chateau in the Sky'.
                         
          He leads her out onto a second rooftop ballroom.
                         
                          NAOMI
           A second ballroom. Obviously. Gotta
           have a second ballroom.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Where George Gershwin and the
           Astors danced to Shep Fields and
           his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra.
                         
          He grabs her in a ballroom dance move.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Come on, cheap girl. We can be Fred
           Austere and Stingy Rogers.
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (PULLING AWAY)
           I just need one of your collection
           of bathrooms.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Behind the telephone box fish tank.
           See you on the balcony.
           62.
                         
                         
          Arthur goes onto the balcony. Naomi's notices a figure
          sitting in the dark, stifling a cough. Hobson.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Hobson?
                         
                          HOBSON
           He's not like other men, you know.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I think I realised that as I
           plunged into the Hudson with a
           junkie. But I like him. He's fun.
                         
          Hobson fights another little cough. She gets up.
                         
                          HOBSON
           I know he is. That's the problem.
                         
                          NAOMI
           What does that mean?
                         
                          HOBSON
           I'm sure Arthur will explain.
                         
                         
          EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT
                         
          The live version of Simon and Garfunkel's `The 59th Street
          Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy') is playing on speakers. Arthur
          and Naomi look out over the view, the park, dark and empty in
          contrast to the cheering and clapping on the recording.
                         
          Naomi sips her wine. Arthur throws back a whisky.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Your kids' book. What was it about?
                         
                          NAOMI
           `Vlad the Inhaler'. About an
           asthmatic boy detective.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Be serious.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Oh, it was dumb. `The Boy Whose
           Heart Escaped'. It was about this
           kid who wakes up to find his heart
           has climbed out and is shinning
           down the drainpipe to freedom.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I love it.
           63.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           Rainbow Press said it was too
           disturbing. But it wasn't literal -
           there wasn't a kid lying there with
           a gaping hole in his chest. It was
           just this cute little heart
           bouncing up and down shouting `You
           can't catch me, mofo!'. I'm
           paraphrasing.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Did he catch the heart?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Never got that far.
                         
          Arthur wobbles a little more.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           You like the hooch, don't you?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Only if I'm sad, happy or bored.
           There's this bit in a book Hobson
           used to read me as a kid that says
           it all: `We must stop eating
           cookies, Frog!' cried Toad, as he
           ate another.'
                         
                          NAOMI
           Frog and Toad! I loved Frog and
           Toad!
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (FROM MEMORY)
           `Frog put the cookies in a box.
           `There' he said. Now we will not
           eat any more cookies.' `But we can
           open the box.' Frog tied some
           string around the box. `There' he
           said, `Now we will not eat any more
           cookies'. `But we can cut the
           string and open the box'.
                         
          Naomi lays her head on Arthur's shoulder.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           So Frog took the box outside. He
           shouted in a loud voice, `Hey
           birds, here are cookies!' Birds
           came from everywhere. They picked
           up all the cookies in their beaks
           and flew away. `

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Now we have no more cookies to eat'
           `Excellent!' said Toad, `I am going
           home now to bake a cake.'

          They might be about to kiss. But Arthur holds back.
                         
                          NAOMI
           That was beautiful. It's like you
           read it yesterday.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          Arthur's blissed out face, lying in bed in the soft light.
                         
                          HOBSON (OOV)
           Frog and Toad stayed on the island
           all afternoon.
                         
          Hobson's reading `Frog and Toad' to Arthur.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           They ate wet sandwiches without
           iced tea. They were two close
           friends sitting alone together.
                         
          Hobson closes the book and turns out the light.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I couldn't tell her, Hobson. She
           isn't the Komodo dragon. She's my
           toad.
                         
                          HOBSON
           You're quite sure about this?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Yes.
                         
                          HOBSON
           (under her breath)
           Oh, bollocks.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY
                         
          Naomi's sitting with Ralph, who's scratching off lottery
          tickets.
           65.
                         
                         
                          RALPH
           I don't know, honey. What's this
           teabag even doing here? Couldn't he
           make it in Lord of the Rings land?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Not that it matters, but he's a
           billionaire.
                         
                          RALPH
           You have my full permission to
           marry him.
                         
                         
          EXT. SHOWJUMPING FIELD. DAY
                         
          A HORSE clears a showjumping barrier. Grant applauds.
                         
                          GRANT
           Bravo, Vivienne! Well done!
                         
          Arthur's watching, sweating in the sunshine, while Marty and
          Hobson wait in the Bentley.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'd be wary, Grant. She's planning
           to ride you around the course next.
           Her last boyfriend broke his ankle
           jumping that ditch. Had to be
           destroyed on the spot.
                         
          Vivienne canters her horse up to them.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur. What's so urgent that you
           had to come all the way out here?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm in love. With a woman who isn't
           exactly who you'd describe as
           Susan. She's called Naomi.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur, we've been through this!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Won't you at least meet her?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           What family is she from?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The Snarts of Detroit.
           66.
                         
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Never heard of them.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No, because they're normal. She's a
           walking tour guide, her dad's a
           retired car worker.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Susan will generate quality sons,
           not oil-soaked car monkeys.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Unbelievable! Why don't you just
           keep me here, pay a servant to wank
           me into a bottle once a day...
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           ...then inject it all into a field
           of heiresses and see who farts out
           a thoroughbred first?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           We need an heir!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Fine! You can have one with Stevey
           Steroids here! Surely even your
           uterus has had a face lift by now.
                         
          Arthur storms away towards the car.
                         
                          GRANT
                          (STEPPING IN)
           That's enough, Arthur...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           None of your business, J Crew.
                         
                          GRANT
           You are so ungrateful to your
           mother. She adores you!
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur. Come back here.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You can shove your inheritance up
           your horse's arse!
           67.
                         
                         
          Arthur jumps into the car and it pulls away. Vivienne sits
          shocked on her horse. But then she throws it into a gallop
          and catches up.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Suit yourself, Arthur. Follow your
           heart. But do be aware I consider
           what you've squandered so far an
           advance on your inheritance. That's
           about $17 million.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Why would you do that? You'd never
           get it back.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           No. But you'd spend the rest of
           your life in court. There's a
           simple solution to all this. Marry
           Susan. And cheat with the nobody
           from Queens.
                         
                         
          INT. DINER - DAY
                         
          Arthur's very drunk, maudlin, sitting opposite Naomi. He's
          holding his menu upside down.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Have you been at the cookies?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I ate the whole jar.
                         
                          NAOMI
           (realising it's serious)
           Oh, man. What? What?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm engaged. To another Susan.
           Woman. Engaged to another woman.
                         
          She slams her menu down.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.
                         
                          NAOMI
           What are you talking about? This is
           bullshit. Who do you think you are?
           Is this some rich guy thing?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I was going to tell you! I just...
           68.
                         
                         
          Naomi gets up and puts on her coat.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Yeah, yeah, you just.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Please, Naomi! I didn't mean for it
           to get to this! I planned to just
           be your friend but then I started
           to fall for you and I thought `I
           can't marry Susan, I might fall for
           Naomi!' But I thought `No I have to
           marry Susan or I'll be poor so I
           won't fall for Naomi' But then I
           did fall for you! Because you're
           brainy and funny and gorgeous and
           too smart to do walking tours.
           You're too smart, Snart. Smart
           Snart. There's a 99 cent cereal.
                          (BEAT)
           Anyway, so I went to see Vivienne,
           and I said `I can't marry Susan, I
           love Naomi she's my Frog my Toad' I
           don't know any more.
                         
                          NAOMI
           You're frog.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Thanks. Then she said `Noooo, if
           you don't marry Susan, I'll make
           you pay all the inheritance money
           back even if you can't - ha ha ha'.
           Okay she didn't laugh but she might
           as well have, the evil cow. Because
           it's like all the money ever and
           they'll put not just me but both of
           us in prison and your dad, like in
           Dickens. There'll be ghosts, and
           Oliver and....
                         
          He stops, his mouth flapping like a fish.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Maybe if I'd spotted this facet of
           your personality earlier we
           wouldn't be having this
           conversation.
                         
          She heads towards the door. Arthur regains his lucidity for a
          moment.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Toad? Stay a bit longer. Please?
           69.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           Why?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           'cause it'll reduce the proportion
           of my life I'll spend feeling
           utterly miserable.
                         
          Naomi watches him take another big slug of wine.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Bye, Arthur.
                         
          Arthur looks confused.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Bea Arthur? What's she got to do
           with all this?
                         
          She shakes her head and goes.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
                         
          Naomi's looking very sad, shaking - because she's comforting
          Ralph, who is sobbing on her shoulder.
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's going to be okay. I'll get you
           a beer, yeah?
                         
                          RALPH
           I just have to be alone for a
           minute...Oh, G-d, I can't bear
           it...
                         
                         
          INT. DANE COOK CONCERT - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur sits miserable, drinking, as he sits beside Susan at a
          Dane Cook gig.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
                         
          Naomi's been crying. She's reading the screen of an ancient
          Apple Mac: `THE BOY WHOSE HEART ESCAPED' by N J Snart. She
          reads a paragraph - and smiles. This stuff isn't so bad.
           70.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE - BALLROOM - NIGHT.
                         
          Arthur and Susan are getting a dance lesson from a
          CHOREOGRAPHER, clicking her fingers to a club anthem version
          of the awful Jefferson Starship song. Arthur dances terribly.
                         
          Hobson watches sadly.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. NIGHT
                         
          Naomi's typing, getting back into it.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY
                         
          The tailor is positioning a top hat on Arthur's miserable
          head. He's shirtless and unshaven.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY
                         
          The sun is coming up over Queens.
                         
          An ancient dot matrix printer spits out a final page. Naomi
          is at a desk with A PILE OF FINISHED MANUSCRIPTS and
          envelopes to various publishers. One is to `Rainbow Press'.
                         
                         
          EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY
                         
          Naomi's pointing at the Chrysler Building for a particularly
          grumpy bunch of tourists of all types and ages.

           RUDE MALE TOURIST
           Hey. I got a question.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Please, interrupt. Hell, who wants
           to come home with me and butt in
           with questions while I'm watching
           Letterman? `Yo. How tall is Dave?'
                          (BEAT)
           Sorry, sir. Late night, no sleep,
           long day. What's your question?
           71.
                         
                         
          The opening bars of a familiar song start up somewhere,
          filling the street. Suddenly, some of the members of her tour
          group start lip syncing to Phil Collins.
                         
           RUDE MALE TOURIST
           How can I just let you walk away,
           just let you leave without a trace?
                         
                          FEMALE TOURIST
           When I stand here taking every
           breath with you, ooh...
                         
                          MALE TOURIST 2
           You're the only one who really knew
           me at all.
                         
          A van with speakers on the top is parked nearby, pumping out
          the music.
                         
                          NAOMI
           What is going on?
                         
           OLD FEMALE TOURIST
           How can you just walk away from me,
           when all I can do is watch you
           leave?
                         
           TEENAGE BOY TOURIST
           'cause we've shared the laughter
           and the pain...
                         
                          NEWSSTAND GUY
           And even shared the tears.
                         
          A Yellow Cab goes by, the driver lip-syncing out the window.
                         
           NEWSSTAND GUY (CONT'D)
           You're the only one who really knew
           me at all.
                         
          The song hits a hard club mix. Arthur bursts from the back of
          the van in a frog outfit! The `tourists' launch into a well-
          rehearsed dance.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (lip syncing too)
           So take a look at me now, 'cause
           there's just an empty space.
           And there's nothing left here to
           remind me, just the memory of your
           face.

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Take a look at me now, `cause
           there's just an empty space, And
           you coming back to me is against
           all odds and that's what I've got
           to face...Just take a look at me
           now.
                         
          The song builds to a dance crescendo.
                         
          A magical moment. The crowd watches. How can she say no?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Sorry to be a wet blanket, folks.
           he's getting married. But I guess
           he didn't choreograph that bit for
           you.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But..but this took ages to
           rehearse. I had the frog outfit
           specially made. These aren't actual
           tourists.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I gathered that, Arthur. Are you
           capable of doing anything without
           it being a grand gesture?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What do you mean?
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's like Hobson said. You're not
           like other men. If you were normal,
           if the money and the booze didn't
           cloud everything, you'd deal with
           the fact that you're engaged,
           rather than just looking for ways
           to win me back. But it was a lovely
           routine, really. Fantastic outfit.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I just wanted to see you.
                         
          He takes out his flask and has a swig.
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (SYMPATHETIC)
           You need to see someone, Arthur.
           Seriously.
           73.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S PENTHOUSE. SHOWER - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur's in his cuboid David Blaine shower. He picks up his
          binoculars.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson! Female Tom Hanks has had a
           haircut! Hobson?
                         
          But Marty pipes up on the little inset Hobson screen. He
          looks at a note in Hobson's handwriting.
                         
                          MARTY
           It says here you shouldn't forget
           to clean your junk. I guess that's
           what...'genitahlio-ah' is.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Marty? What are you doing there?
                         
                          MARTY
           Hobson left me in charge. She's
           gone to bed. She had a headache.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           She's had quite a few headaches
           lately.
                         
                          MARTY
           She blacked out.
                         
                         
          INT. HOBSON'S ROOM. DAY
                         
          Hobson's in bed, watching a Discovery Channel documentary
          about grizzly bears. Arthur hits pause.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Put my bears back on, Arthur.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Not until you answer my question.
                         
          Hobson closes her eyes. She hams the next bit.
                         
                          HOBSON
           I'm travelling down a white tunnel.
           To - a garden? Mother? Father? Why
           is it so hot? Who's the red
           gentleman with the big pitchfork?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Will you cut it out?
           74.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur. There are three books. This
           is important. Take them back to the
           library...
                         
          She feigns a melodramatic death.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson, please. Don't die any more.
           It's getting very boring.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur. Old women, like bears, get
           sore heads. Are you okay? You look
           a little lost.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Naomi doesn't want to see me.
                         
                          HOBSON
           A terrible shame she had to go. A
           little tart like that could have
           saved you a fortune in prostitutes.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Listen, old woman. Don't ever talk
           about Naomi that way again. What
           gives you the right to be such a
           snob? You're just...you're just...
           Mary Poppins with a menopause!
                         
          Arthur storms out, slamming the door. But within 10 seconds
          he returns, humbled, ashamed - a regretful naughty child.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Hobson, I've never raised my voice
           to you. I'm sorry.
                         
                          HOBSON
           I'm sorry too. You know, Arthur,
           you may be growing up.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Do you want anything?
                         
                          HOBSON
           I want to be younger.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sorry, it's your job to be older.
                          (THINKS)
           Hobson. If you're feeling better
           tomorrow, will you accompany me
           somewhere?
           75.
                         
                         
          She pats his hand gently.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Of course, Arthur.
                         
                         
          INT. CAR - DAY
                         
          Marty and Hobson are staring, bemused.
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           How do I look?
                         
          Arthur's wearing a huge, ludicrous wig and beard. Hobson and
          Marty fight giggles.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           I can't have this getting out. I'm
           in the public eye.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Yes, it would be disastrous to harm
           such a dignified profile.
                         
          He looks, scared, at the building.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           It's going to be okay, Arthur.
                         
                         
          INT. AA MEETING - DAY
                         
          AA MEMBERS are sitting in a circle. MEGAN, a respectable-
          looking, smart woman, is speaking.
                         
                          MEGAN
           I was waking up four, five, six
           mornings a week in different mens'
           beds...
                         
          Arthur (in his ludicrous disguise), Hobson and Marty enter.
                         
                          MEGAN (CONT'D)
           I wanted to die. To be nobody.
                         
                         
          INT. AA MEETING - DAY - LATER
                         
          A man, JAMES, speaks emotionally.
                         
                          JAMES
           I steal from my friends, my family.
           I sold my son's pedal car so I
           could score junk...
           76.
                         
                         
          Arthur - utterly depressed - has his head in his hands.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Jesus....
                         
                          JAMES
           I accidentally backed my car over
           my mother outside Walgreens...
                         
          Marty chuckles. He tries to fist-bump James.
                         
                          HOBSON
                          (WHISPERS)
           Marty! This isn't a sports bar in
           Chicago. These people aren't here
           to brag.
                         
                          JAMES
                          (SOBBING)
           I had a business, a home and it's
           all gone! I'm in this fucking grave
           and they're pouring the earth in!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Whoooaaahh. Okay, cut. I don't know
           about anyone else, but this isn't
           exactly killing my thirst.
                         
                          LEADER
           Well why did you come...What's your
           name?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Gandalf.
                         
          Arthur thinks. Seriousness - his least favourite thing - is
          upon him. He takes a deep breath. But -
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry, you're not going to
           convince me my life isn't fun.
                          (TO JAMES)
           And no offence but if I ran over my
           mother, I'd be out celebrating.
           Which is what I plan to do right
           now. Come on, Hobson. Marty.
                         
          Arthur leaves, the door swinging behind him.
                         
           WOMAN (O.S)
           I'm Jane. And I believe I have a
           dependence on alcohol...
                         
          The woman confessing is Hobson - on Arthur's behalf!
           77.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           ...and because I have done nothing
           with the astonishing opportunities
           handed to me, apart from pissing
           away my inheritance and drinking
           enough to kill a rhino.
                         
          Arthur, having heard, comes back in.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           But imagine being me! I once ended
           up in bed with the daughters of
           three of the Rolling Stones. But a)
           I don't remember a thing about it,
           b) apparently I was sick on two of
           the women before c) losing control
           of my bladder on the third. All
           such fun...until the strangers I
           pay to be my friends have gone, the
           fog parts and there's a hole so
           big, you could pour all the
           champagne in the world into it and
           never fill it up. But I've got so
           much potential, a good heart, I'm a
           good person, even if I've
           completely wasted my short,
           precious life because I somehow
           convinced myself that happiness is
           a Komodo dragon, a case of booze
           and the memory of having once
           stripped naked to Beethoven for a
           coachload of German tourists who I
           met outside the Rainforest Cafe.
                         
          She's done. An awkward silence.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's always the quiet ones.
                         
                         
          EXT. MIDTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY
                         
          The car drives through Manhattan.
                         
                         
          INT. CAR - DAY
                         
          Arthur stares out of the window, beaten, drunk.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Thanks, Hobson. Maybe you can go
           every time I crave a drink?
           78.
                         
                         
          Hobson doesn't even crack a smile. Arthur gets out his phone
          and scrolls - past Naomi's name, to Susan's. He dials.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Susan? Look, I know the wedding
           date is set. But fancy bringing it
           forward? I just want to get it over
           with. In a good way. Think about
           it, yeah?
                         
          He ends the call. Silence. He looks to Hobson.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           It's the agony of possibility,
           Hobson. It just hurts too much to
           know I could still be with Naomi if
           I had the guts.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Just promise you'll never ask me to
           sleep with Susan for you.
                         
                         
          EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY
                         
          Naomi's riding the bus. Her phone rings. `Number withheld'.
          She rolls her eyes and answers.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur, if that's...
                          (BEAT)
           Hello? Yes. Yes, I did...Yes.
           Sorry? Really? Well I worked pretty
           hard on it..Love to...Love
           to...What time?
                         
          Incredibly excited, she grabs a pen and writes on a walking
          tours brochure: `JULIAN BARBER...RAINBOW PRESS...'
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           I'll call in dead to work. Bye.
                         
          She writes `TUESDAY 11.30' and an address.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          There's a ring at the doorbell. Ralph answers. It's Hobson.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Good afternoon, Mr Snart. Is Naomi
           here?
           79.
                         
                         
                          RALPH
           You must be the nanny.
                         
                          HOBSON
           I must be.
                         
          Ralph embraces her.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           Please stop this, I can't inhale
           and am in danger of treading on one
           of your knuckles.
                         
          Ralph releases her.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           If you and your undershirt would
           walk two paces back I could enter
           this dwelling.
                         
          Naomi appears, looking more of a writer than a tour guide.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Well, well.
                         
                          RALPH
           Ever since I met Arthur I liked
           him. We have to make sure these two
           wonderful kids stay together...
                         
                          HOBSON
           Try not to talk. It's not your
           words but the breath which bears
           them. Perhaps you could repair to
           the East Wing and make me a cup of
           tea? I wish to speak to Naomi.
                         
                          RALPH
           Sure, sure.
                         
          Ralph leaves.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur is having a pre-wedding
           party tonight. You should come.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Oh, should I? Are all the other
           girls he passed up going too?
                         
          Hobson picks up a letter from Rainbow Press and peruses it.
           80.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           Don't you want to show Arthur how
           well you're doing?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Tell him thanks, but I have a
           deadline.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur doesn't know I'm here. He's
           far too decent to be involved in
           something so tawdry. You could
           bring your father. A magical
           experience before he's too big to
           leave this apartment.
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (DISBELIEF)
           Why would I go to this? Why would I
           do that to myself?
                         
                          HOBSON
           My dear, if there's one thing old
           women can tell, it's young men in
           love. And the food promises to be
           breathtakingly free.
                         
          Hobson has a slight dizzy spell and sits down.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Are you alright?
                         
                          HOBSON
           Better than you, dear.
                         
                          NAOMI
           You really look out for Arthur,
           don't you?
                         
                          HOBSON
           Yes. And it is a job that I
           recommend highly.
                         
          Ralph comes back and with a cup of disgusting-looking tea.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           You really look out for this
           gentleman, from what I've heard.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Ah, what am I gonna do? The no-kill
           pet shelter won't take him.
                         
          Ralph hands Hobson the cup of tea.
           81.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           Thank you. Would you go the
           bathroom and commence washing? You
           only have three hours and it could
           be quite a project.
                         
          Ralph goes. Naomi takes the tea.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I appreciate what you're trying to
           do but I'm not going to that party.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Suit yourself.
                         
          Hobson gets up, still dizzy.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Have you seen a doctor?
                         
                          HOBSON
           Yes. And he has seen me.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I think Arthur has a very good
           friend. May I kiss you on the
           cheek?
                         
                          HOBSON
           Is it something you feel strongly
           about?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Yes.
                         
          But Hobson falls back into her chair heavily, looking sicker.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           Dad! Call 911.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT
                         
          HORDES OF SMARTLY-DRESSED RICH PEOPLE are gathering on Burt
          Johnson's mansion for the society night of the year. A high-
          level security presence is much in evidence.
                         
                         
          INT. JOHNSON MANSION. BALLROOM - NIGHT
                         
          A LIVE BAND plays a cheesy soft-rock version of `Addicted to
          Love'. ARISTOCRATS mingle with CRASS NEW MONEY TYPES mingle
          with TIGER WOODS. The band finishes the song.
           82.
                         
                         
                          VOCALIST
           Thanks. We're going to move things
           up tempo now with `The Only Thing
           That Looks Good On Me Is You.'
                         
          The band start playing again. Partygoers hit the dance floor.
          Vivienne, Susan, Burt and Erica pass a huge ice statue of
          Susan and Arthur in a loving embrace and amazing catering.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Splendid affair, Susan.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Don't thank me, thank Erica.
                         
          Erica shrugs modestly. Arthur appears. Burt puts a big burly
          arm around him and squeezes him a little too hard.
                         
                         
          EXT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT
                         
          Naomi climbs out of a crappy cab. She's on her phone.
                         
                          NAOMI
           With all due respect, Hobson,
           you're talking out of your frumpy
           English ass. Arthur needs to know!
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Hobson's in bed looking ill. Ralph's fussing over her pillow.
          Hobson slaps him away.
                         
                          HOBSON
           You are not to pull him out of that
           party on my behalf.
                          (BEAT)
           Hello? Naomi!
                         
          But Naomi's gone. Ralph tries to plump the pillow again.
                         
                          RALPH
           You're gonna get through this,
           babe. Then who knows what the
           future may hold?
                         
                         
          EXT. PARTY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Naomi hurries past A DOOR MAN with a clipboard.
                         
                          DOOR MAN
           Excuse me, madam. Name? Madam?
           83.
                         
                         
          Naomi grabs the arm of A MALE GUEST.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Snart plus one.
                         
          She hurries in with the bemused, but delighted man. The DOOR
          MAN checks his clipboard.
                         
                         
          INT. JOHNSON MANSION. NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Naomi enters the party, releasing the man, who's disappointed
          to see her go. She looks around for Arthur, getting admiring
          looks from other men - and women.
                         
                          PASSING WOMAN
           Nice dress. Vera Wang?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Ross Dress For Less. You know where
           Arthur is?
                         
                          PASSING WOMAN
                          (SHRUGS)
           Sorry.
                         
          Naomi moves on. The Door Man appears, looking around for the
          gatecrasher. The man whose arm she took on the way in - he's
          called JUSTIN - is also on the prowl for her...
                         
                         
          INT. JOHNSON MANSION. BALLROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Burt takes to the stage to applause.
                         
                          BURT
           When Arthur proposed to my
           daughter, I was overjoyous. The
           Bach-Templemeads are my kind of
           people: classy. Respectable. Well
           spoken. People like in Shakespeare
           in Love, who esprouse the same
           values I have always upheld both in
           my business and spiritual life. But
           tonight isn't about me or America's
           leading independent formula brand.
                         
          Arthur takes the stage to wild applause.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Thank you, Burt! I've actually
           prepared a little surprise song
           with my friends here.
           84.
                         
                         
          The band starts playing `Close To You' by the Carpenters.
          Arthur sings to Susan, down in the crowd.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Why does cash suddenly appear,
           every time you are near?
                         
          The audience laugh.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Just like me, it longs to be, close
           to Sue. Why do cars fall out of the
           sky, all of which, I can buy...
                          (STOPS)
           I'll sing a proper song.
                          (SINGS)
           You say potayto and I say potahto,
           You say tomayto and I say tomahto,
           potayto, potahto, tomayto, tomahto,
           Let's call the whole thing off! You
           say AA, and I say `no way', you say
           `Red Bull' and I say `Go away,
           Rehab, No way, Red Bull...
                         
                         
          INT. JOHNSON MANSION - ANOTHER LARGE ROOM
                         
          JUSTIN approaches Naomi, who's still looking around for
          Arthur.
                         
                          JUSTIN
           We meet again!
                         
                          NAOMI
           Yeah. Have you seen Arthur?
                         
                          JUSTIN
           The ballroom. I'll take you to him.
                         
          Justin takes Naomi's arm and leads her at a leisurely pace.
          They pass a portrait of Susan.
                         
                          JUSTIN (CONT'D)
           I'm so happy for Arthur and Susan.
                         
          Justin points at a portrait of Susan.
                         
                          JUSTIN (CONT'D)
           Isn't she beautiful?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Of course she is. Why would Arthur
           marry a pig?
           85.
                         
                         
          The Door Man appears, seeing Naomi.
                         
                          JUSTIN
           What business is your family in?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Hm? Oh, I'm the heiress to a
           fortune built on small pets.
                         
                          JUSTIN
           I'm sorry?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Hamsters, mice, doglets...
                         
                          JUSTIN
           Doglets?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Tiny dogs. The technology's not
           perfect. Seeing a horse the size of
           a can of soup fall dead before your
           eyes - that shit stays with you.
                         
          They walk through a door, ending up in a garden.
                         
                         
          EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
                         
                          NAOMI
           Are you sure he's this way?
                         
                          JUSTIN
           Absolutely.
                         
          Naomi turns to A WOMAN.
                         
                          NAOMI
           (to a WOMAN)
           Excuse me. Have you seen Arthur?
                         
                          WOMAN
           That way. The ballroom.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Bye, Justin.
                         
          Naomi hurries away - running straight into the Door Man.
                         
                          DOOR MAN
           Excuse me, madam. You're not an
           authorized guest.
           86.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           I know that. I'm here to give
           Arthur some very important news.
                         
                          DOOR MAN
           Of course you are.
           (takes her arm)
           Shall we discuss this outside?
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (SHOUTS)
           Get your hands off me!
                         
          They tussle. Arthur intercedes.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's okay, Jeff. She can stay.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur, can I talk to you?
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT - LATER
                         
          A MAN IN A WHITE COAT is on the phone beside Hobson's bed.
                         
           MAN IN A WHITE COAT
           We ran tests. It was just a dizzy
           spell. We'll be sending her home
           tonight.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But what about the other blackouts?
                         
          Hobson snatches the phone from the Man in a White Coat.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur, I'm fine. Do not leave that
           party.
                         
                         
          INT. JOHNSON MANSION - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
                         
          Arthur's on the phone, coat on, in a big empty panelled room.
                         
           HOBSON (O.S, OFF)
           Especially now that Naomi is there.
                         
          The call ends. Arthur looks across at Naomi, at the other end
          of the room, looking so beautiful.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           She's fine. They're sending her
           home. Do you want a drink?
           87.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           No, thanks, Arthur. I should go.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But you came all this way. There's
           ridiculously fancy food, there's...
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur. Please. Can you just call
           me a cab?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You're a cab.
                         
          No laughter this time. It's not funny. He takes out his
          iPhone again. Stares at it.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Shit. Hobson usually...
                         
                          NAOMI
           Orders cabs to take the girls away?
                         
          Arthur's busted. He scrolls the phone for a cab number.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Thank you for coming all this way.
           I'm sorry for all the stupid
           presents and calls and gestures.
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's okay.
                         
          Naomi looks up at a portrait of Burt and young, prissy, but
          beautiful Susan.
                         
                          NAOMI (CONT'D)
           She was a looker from the get-go.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What were you like as a kid?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Nuts. I thought the moon followed
           me. I would walk and think the moon
           went any place that I did. I
           thought it meant something special
           would happen. So I've been waiting.
           What an ass.
                         
          Arthur sees a sound system. He goes over and plugs his iPhone
          into it, then takes Naomi in his arms.
           88.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Dance?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur. We've been through this.
           Call that cab please.
                         
          Arthur looks down into her eyes and hits `PLAY' on his
          iPhone. Music starts: it's not a slow, smoochy song but big,
          brassy and upbeat.
                         
          MUSIC: `NELLIE THE ELEPHANT' BY MANDY MILLER
                         
          Arthur ballroom dances Naomi at speed around the room.
                         
                          MANDY MILLER
           To Bombay, a travelling circus
           came, they brought an intelligent
           elephant and Nellie was her name...
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (LAUGHING)
           What the bejeezus is this?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson used to sing it to me.
                          (SINGING ALONG)
           One dark night, she slipped her
           iron chain. Off she ran to
           Hindustan and was never seen again.
           Nellie the Elephant packed her
           bags, And said goodbye to the
           circus, Off she went with a
           trumpety trump, Trump trump
           trump...
                         
          It's energetic, wonderful, as romantic as any slow dance.
          They stop dancing. Arthur stares at Naomi. At last, they
          kiss. But the music stops. It's Vivienne.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Is this the tour guide?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           She's a writer.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Is this the Vivienne?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Crowded field, writing.

                          ARTHUR
           Maybe someone will see her
           potential.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           We all know who's seen her
           potential.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Meaning?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Oh, of course, you don't know, do
           you?
                         
          Arthur suddenly goes pale.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Vivienne, please. Don't...
                         
                          NAOMI
           What is going on here?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           My son became fond of you. You're
           not the first. Or the last, I
           imagine. Anyway I was scanning his
           monthly expenses - which always
           makes for entertaining reading, all
           those gifts for all those girls -
           and found he'd bought an entire
           publishing company called...what
           was it now? Rainbow Press.
                         
                          NAOMI
           You bought Rainbow press? So you
           could tell them to publish my book?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           He knows people, dear. I'm sure you
           do too, though the people you know
           tend not to own books, let alone
           publishers. Arthur, I trust we'll
           see you back at the party? Susan's
           a little worried.
                         
          Vivienne leaves. Naomi storms away. Arthur chases.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           NAOMI! PLEASE! I didn't think I
           would ever see you again. I was
           just trying to give you some...
           90.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (GASPS)
           Confidence? Self esteem isn't a
           gift, Arthur! It isn't a fur coat
           or a thousand billion orchids or an
           apartment made from truffles or
           whatever else you rich freaks use
           to express love!
                         
          Arthur looks incredibly hurt.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I do express love! I love you!
                         
                          NAOMI
           Don't say that!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You just told me to! And stop going
           on about me being rich! You think
           it's easy being trapped by money?
                         
          Naomi gets her old phone out. She speaks into it.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Hello, Amnesty? Come quick!
           Arthur's being held against his
           will in Guantamoney Bay!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Abu Greed?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Stop riffing with me! How dare you
           do what you did. I didn't need your
           money to feel good about myself!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No. Being cheap gives you that.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Huh?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           At least I'm prepared to have fun.
           To live. I'm not all `Oooh look at
           me with my antique food, aren't I
           cool?' And...and...your phone's
           RUBBISH! It's made of bits of old
           doorbell and vibrator, I bet you
           can only get calls from 1994 on it!
           91.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
                          (BOILS OVER)
           As long as I don't get any from a
           drunk, rich fuck up like you!
                         
          A door opens.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Hello? I heard shouting.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I'm an employee of Arthur's. I came
           to complain about the conditions.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Naomi, please...
                         
                          NAOMI
           Mr Bach-Templemead, I know you
           thought putting half and half in
           the staff kitchen was an
           improvement.
                          (REALLY ANGRY)
           But some people prefer Coffee Mate!
           You were disrespectful. I quit!
                         
          Naomi walks away, slamming a door behind her.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Because you changed the creamer?
                          (BEAT)
           Arthur, Marty called from the
           hospital.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's okay, Hobson's fine. I spoke
           to her doctor.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Apparently you didn't.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Hobson is lying in bed, looking even iller than before.
                         
                          HOBSON
           It's just a headache!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Stop saying that! You bribed a
           hospital orderly to tell me you
           were okay!
           92.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           Oh, bothersnaps. What do doctors
           know?
                         
          The door opens. Marty enters with a shopping cart.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Da dahhhh! I give you the amazing
           costly, health-giving presents!
                         
          Arthur starts to produce gifts for Hobson: jewellery,
          expensive bath products, perfumes, clothes, a DVD...
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           'Wake up and Smell the Carcass'..
           (reads the DVD)
           `A compilation of the band's most
           stomach-churning music videos and
           deathly live performances...'
                         
          He produces a DARTH VADER HELMET.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Put this on, please.
                         
                          HOBSON
           I don't want to put it on.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Put it on. Or I'll fire you.
                          (PAUSE)
           Okay, or I won't fire you.
                         
          She dons the full face helmet.
                         
                          HOBSON
                          (VADER VOICE)
           How much did you waste on this
           poppycock?
                         
          Arthur and Marty laugh.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
                          (VADER VOICE)
           I see you've decided not to grow up
           after all.
                         
                          MARTY
           She sounds like Darth Invader!
                         
          Finally, Arthur unwraps a very high-end DVD player and TV.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Why, Arthur?
           93.
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          The room is dark. Arthur, Hobson and Marty are all on the
          bed, bathed in blue light from the huge new TV.
                         
           VOICEOVER (O.S.)
           Stargazer, known for her
           distinctive white mottled back...
                         
          It's a documentary about grizzly bears.
                         
                          VOICEOVER (CONT'D)
           ...is determined to catch the
           salmon, despite the treacherous
           rapids...
                         
          A DOCTOR enters.
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Mr Bach-Templemead? Do you have a
           moment?
                         
                         
          INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur's looking delighted. But the doctor is grave.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Home? That's great news. Isn't it?
                         
                         
          INT/EXT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          We see a short montage of Arthur, now sober, taking care of
          Hobson with Marty's help: Reading to her...Watching another
          bear documentary...Arthur doing silly yoga for Hobson...
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur is quietly cleaning Hobson's room. He stumbles on a
          document. It reads: `THE BOY WHOSE HEART ESCAPED' BY N J
          SNART. FINAL MANUSCRIPT.' He opens it.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           How did this get here?
                         
                          HOBSON
           I have no idea.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You might have a brain tumour but
           you're not a complete veggie burger
           just yet. Has Naomi been here?
           94.
                         
                         
                          HOBSON
           She dropped by once or twice.
           Frightful needy trollop.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I thought she gave up writing.
                         
          Arthur's reading the manuscript, bearing Hobson's notations:
          `Shorten', `Wonderful - do NOT cut!', `Beautiful. I cried'.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Just trying to spare her outright
           humiliation while I'm still here.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Don't wear yourself out. You're not
           going anywhere soon.
                         
          He taps the top of a state-of-the-art heart monitor.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           World's most advanced heart rate
           monitor. The tiniest problem will
           alert your own private platoon of
           paramedics camped out downstairs...
                         
          Hobson takes Arthur's hand.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Arthur. I've loved caring for you
           so much. But you'll never grow up
           with me around. So either I retire.
           Or I die. Option 1 involves too
           much paperwork and blather with
           having to find somewhere else to
           live. And no offence to you, dear
           boy...
                         
          She glances at a MASSIVE PILE OF BEAR DOCUMENTARY DVDs beside
          THE WORLD'S BIGGEST TEDDY BEAR.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           ...but I think we've exhausted the
           bear-based entertainment. Which
           leaves option 2.
                         
          Arthur can't fight the tears any more.
                         
                          HOBSON (CONT'D)
           You're a good son, Arthur. You can
           do anything with your life that you
           want. Just like I did.
           95.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But you spent half of it looking
           after a spoilt drunk twat.
                         
                          HOBSON
           Exactly. Sorry Arthur. I'm past my
           use-by date.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sorry, Hobson, You don't win this
           one. I need you to care for me.

           Now take your fish oil.
                         
                         
          INT. HOBSON'S ROOM - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur, in a chair at the end of the bed, wakes with a start
          from a dream. He looks across to Hobson, who is very still.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Hobson?
                         
          The expensive monitor is dead. He jumps up.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           HOBSON!
           (hammering the machine)
           Why the fuck has the stupid thing
           not gone off?
                          (SHOUTS)
           GET UP HERE! SHE'S NOT...
                         
          He sees that the monitor is unplugged. The cord is in
          Hobson's hand. It's over. Hobson's dead.
                         
          Arthur sobs his heart out.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY
                         
          It's a few weeks later. The place is very, very messy. The
          place also seems to be heavily splattered with all colors of
          paint.
                         
          SPLOTCH! A big lump of red paint thuds into Hobson's giant
          teddy bear, which is already heavily spattered.
                         
          Arthur's sitting naked, apart from a helmet, in his tiny army
          paintball tank. He's in a blank, drunken daze, firing paint
          at the teddy. The tank turret rotates. He shoots walls,
          possessions, furniture. He stops.
           96.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Would Frog ever get up again? Or
           would he just sit in his tank,
           crying and soiling himself until he
           died of dehydration because he
           didn't even have the energy to eat
           a wet sandwich.
                         
          He looks down at an ashes urn.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Hobson! Why are you in there when I
           need you?
           (lifts lid off urn)
           HOBSON!
                         
          He's rewarded with a face full of ashes. Angrily he spins the
          turret through 360 degrees, firing paint.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Arrrrgghhh!
                         
          Marty comes in - and is hit hard by paint.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Sorry.
                         
                          MARTY
           How's the tea?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Shockingly bad, thanks, Marty.
                         
                          MARTY
           Want to talk about the Cubs game?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Nahhh. Can I be alone please?
                         
          Marty goes. Arthur picks up his phone and scrolls down to
          Naomi's name. He thinks for a moment, hits `call'.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S APARTMENT. DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Naomi is shopping. She looks at the phone, sees Arthur's
          name. She so wants to answer. But doesn't.
                         
                         
          INT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Arthur stands on the balcony. He peers down at Manhattan far,
          far below.
           97.
                         
                         
          INT. PIERRE HOTEL - HOTEL BEDROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          A COUPLE are having sex. A BODY falls past the window.
                         
                         
          INT. PIERRE HOTEL - RESTAURANT - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The body falls past a window. A huge crash from off.
                         
                         
          EXT. PIERRE HOTEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          PASSERSBY are staring in horror at a yellow cab, its roof
          caved in, the DRIVER shaking in shock.
                         
          Tilt up to find Hobson's HUGE teddy BEAR lying on the roof.
                         
                         
          EXT. ARTHUR'S APARTMENT. BALCONY - DAY
                         
          Arthur's on his phone again.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (leaving a message)
           Naomi? I doubt you'll ever get
           this, because your voicemail
           probably consists of a 4000 year
           old woman who writes the message
           down in hieroglyphics then loses it
           down the back of her incontinence
           loin cloth. Hobson died. Hobson
           died and I've fallen apart...
                         
          The doorbell rings from off.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Marty! Can you get that? Marty!
                          (INTO PHONE)
           Naomi? Could you get it? Hello?
                         
          He throws the cellphone off the roof. A couple of seconds
          pass. We hear a very faint howl of pain from whoever it hit.
                         
                         
          INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
                         
          Arthur opens the door. It's Vivienne.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur! You haven't answered the
           phone for eight days. Susan's
           beside herself. What's going on?
           98.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What do you think's going on?
           Hobson died.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Oh, that.
                         
          She bustles in past Arthur. A PLATOON OF MAIDS follows.
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
                          (TO MAIDS)
           Chop chop! You cleany penthouseio!
           Come on, Arthur. Have to pick
           yourself up, lad. It's like when
           Nixon my Great Dane had to be put
           down. Frightful state for days. But
           I pulled myself together.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You're comparing Hobson to...a dog?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Well, yes. A faithful, humble
           companion who...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Um, I think I'd like you to leave,
           if that's okay. Now?
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Remember who pays for this
           apartment, Arthur. For everything!
                         
          He guides her out the door.
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
           You had damn well better be at that
           wedding, boy.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Don't worry. If I'm going to drink
           myself to death I'll need
           resources. Bye Vivienne...
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           It's mother!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           My mother's dead.
                         
          He slams the door. The phone rings again.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Hello? I'm sorry?

          INT. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY
                         
          Arthur is sitting in an estate attorney's next to MR FINKE,
          a small, dirty man. ATTORNEY MARGARET AHERNE is at a desk
          opposite them, reading from a will.
                         
                          AHERNE
           The last will and testament of Jane
           Hobson.

           County, California.'
                         
          Aherne hands Mr Finke A CHECK for $8,864.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           That'll explain the strong smell of
           bear shit. Sorry.
                         
          Aherne opens a tiny envelope.
                         
                          AHERNE
           To Arthur Bach Templemead, I leave
           this.
                         
          She produces a teabag.
                         
                          AHERNE (CONT'D)
           To operate kettle, press red
           button. Milk in refrigerator;
           that's the big box with the pretty
           light that comes on when you open
           the door.
                          (PAUSE)
           Arthur. You're going to be okay.
           Now it's your turn to look after
           someone. All my deepest, fondest
           love, my dearest boy. I'm smiling
           down at you - or more likely, up at
           you - forever and ever, H xxxxxxxx.

          Close up on the KETTLE, steam issuing forth from the spout.
          Then a MUG with the teabag in it. The kettle boils. A hand
          pours hot water into the mug. Milk is added. And a drop of
          vodka.

                          BURT
           I just want you to know, if he
           doesn't show up for this wedding, I
           can't know what I'll do.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Don't worry, Burt. He's cleaned
           himself up. He's stopped drinking,
           he's anxious to get a real job.
           He's become a responsible citizen.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY
                         
          Arthur is stalking - drunk but determined - through the
          crowds. He comes upon a group of tourists standing by a tour
          bus. Naomi's now wearing a headset mic, pointing south.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Due to a tragic error in the
           architect's drawing, the original
           Statue of Liberty unveiled in 1886
           was just seven inches tall. 100,000
           New Yorkers rioted, having come
           expecting to see something more
           impressive than a garden gnome
           holding up an ice cream...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Naomi!
                         
          Arthur pushes his way through the tourists. He sees her bus
          and headset.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           You're on a bus? With a microphone?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Girl's gotta have a dream.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Naomi. Can you take the next 60
           years off?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Are you okay? You're a mess. You
           look like you...now.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sorry. I accidentally swallowed
           three bottles of hand sanitizer.
           Fascinating story...Okay.

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Drinking was the only way I could
           get the courage to come here and
           say this: I don't need the money. I
           love the money. But I don't lie
           awake all night wondering how I'll
           live without ever seeing it again.
           I just wonder what it's like to go
           24 hours without a steak tartare.
                         
          Naomi looks unconvinced. Arthur pulls out his wallet and
          takes out a load of credit cards.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           The American Express Centurion card
           - you have to spend at least
           $250,000 a year to keep it, which I
           blow in a quiet week.
                         
          He drops it down a drain. He produces another card.

          Drops it down drain too. The tourists are enjoying this.

          The man runs into the road. As Arthur talks, out of focus we
          see the man hit by a car, but get up and keep going.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)

           With police radio app.
                         
          He tosses it over his shoulder. It lands in the beef juice
          pan of a Street French Dip stall. A BIGGER CROWD is
          gathering. Arthur takes off his jacket.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          He throws the jacket in a passing cab's window. He takes off
          his pants.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          He hands the trousers to a PASSERBY. Off with his watch!
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                          (SHOUTS)
           Who wants the watch Neil Armstrong
           wore to step on the sun!
                         
          Arthur flings it in the air. A crazed fight breaks out.
                         
          Arthur stands before Naomi in just his underpants and socks.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           These are from The Gap.
                         
                          NAOMI
           I'm so sorry about Hobson.
                         
          They step away from the tourists.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm sorry about the Rainbow Press.
                         
                          NAOMI
           It's okay. So how did Susan take it
           that you're not marrying her?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           She didn't.
                         
                          NAOMI
           You haven't told her?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           What's it to you? She's your arch-
           enemy.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Are you six? She isn't my enemy.
           She's the woman you proposed to!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I couldn't tell her! Today's the
           biggest day of her life!
                         
                          NAOMI
           The wedding's today? When?
           103.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           12. Which is...
           (looks at his wrist)
           Where's my watch gone?
                         
                          NAOMI
           (looks at her watch)
           It's eight minutes to.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           It's too late, then.
                         
          Naomi hands Arthur her phone.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           I don't know her number! It's in my
           phone's address book in that gloop.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Church?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           St. John the Divine. Can we please
           just get me some clothes...
                         
                          NAOMI
           St John..Fourth largest church in
           the world...111th and Amsterdam.
           It's about four miles. Better
           hurry.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You want me to go there? Like this?
                         
                          NAOMI
           What's the alternative? Jilt Susan
           at the altar? Can I expect the same
           treatment when you dump me?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No! I love you!
                         
          Naomi starts herding her tourists onto her bus.
                         
                          NAOMI
           C'mon, folks...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Naomi! Susan's dad will...
           104.
                         
                         
                          NAOMI
           Arthur. Prove you're not the same
           pampered little boy who can have
           what he wants then toss it aside
           when he's bored. Then we'll talk.
                         
          She sits in the driving seat and belts up.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Naomi! I don't even know the way!
                         
                          NAOMI
           5th...right on Broadway...left at
           Times...Right on 7th...back on
           Broadway....right on Amsterdam. The
           church is the big stone pointy
           thing full of rich people.
                         
          The bus door shuts. Naomi drives away.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           SHIT! TAXI!
                         
          A taxi stops. Arthur feels for his pockets. Ah shit.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Um, can anyone spare...
           (to the DRIVER)
           How much to St. John the Divine
           please?
                         
                          DRIVER
           About 15 bucks...
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (to the crowd)
           Can anyone spare $15 please?
                         
                          DRIVER
           What about tip? You cheapskate?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           30?
                         
          The crowd just stare back. The taxi drives away.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Stop! STOP!
                         
          Arthur looks at a STREET CLOCK: 11:53.
                         
          Arthur starts running in his underwear.
           105.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          GUESTS are taking their pews.
                         
                         
          EXT. FIFTH AVENUE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Arthur runs along Fifth.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Susan is being fussed over by BRIDESMAIDS.
                         
                         
          EXT. BROADWAY - DAY
                         
          Arthur runs up Broadway, passing a Watch and Clock store.
          Every timepiece reads 11:54.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Burt, sitting in a pew, looks at his watch. He looks around
          for Arthur then scowls very scarily.
                         
                         
          EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY
                         
          Arthur stops, out of breath. He sees A LINE OF STREET
          ENTERTAINERS. That gives him an idea.
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (SHOUTS)
           Gather round for the nearly naked
           Yoga man - YOGI BARE! I give you...
                         
          Arthur strikes a sequence of silly poses and names.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           `Chicken forgetting birthday'...
                         
          TOURISTS throw money. Arthur grabs it up. He looks up at the
          Times Square digital clock: 11:56.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           TAXI!
                         
          A taxi stops. Arthur throws the money to THE DRIVER.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           How far can I go with $1.95 and a
           Japanese coin with a hole in it?
           106.
                         
                         
                          DRIVER
           A block and a half.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           GO!
                         
          Arthur jumps in. The cab screeches away.
                         
                         
          EXT. SEVENTH AVENUE - DAY
                         
          The cab halts. Arthur jumps out and starts running again. He
          sees A BUS with `COLUMBUS CIRCLE' in its window.
                         
          We cut to people cheering Arthur, hanging on the bus's front
          bicycle rack. But the DRIVER sees him and hits the brakes.
          Arthur's flung forwards but gets up and keeps running.
                         
          He sees a Subway Station.
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (TO PASSERBY)
           Excuse me, are there trains down
           there, like in films?
                         
                          PASSERBY
           Yes.
                         
          Arthur runs down the steps.
                         
                         
          INT. SUBWAY - DAY
                         
          A train pulls on to the platform. Arthur leaps aboard.
                         
                         
          INT. TRAIN - DAY
                         
          Arthur stands among New Yorkers, none of whom bat an eyelid
          at his appearance. He looks up at the stations.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           (to A MALE PASSENGER)
           Excuse me. Terribly sorry to bother
           you, but...
                         
          Without looking at him, the guy hands him a dollar.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Crikey. Thanks.
           107.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH. SACRISTY - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Susan is ready. She looks to the door. Erica, who is peering
          out, shakes her head with an `I told you so' look.
                         
                         
          INT. NAOMI'S TOUR BUS - DAY
                         
          Naomi's driving her bus up 42nd Street.
                         
                          NAOMI
           (into a headset mic)
           ...originally a rough
           neighbourhood. Some say it was
           called 42nd Street because it
           wasn't safe to spend more than
           forty seconds on it.
                         
          A few grudging laughs from the tourists.
                         
                          MALE TOURIST
           Excuse me.
                         
                          NAOMI
           If you burst into song, you're off
           this bus.
                         
                          MALE TOURIST
           Huh? I want to see St. John the
           Divine.
                         
                          NAOMI
           Sorry, sir, that's not on our route

           I want to know if Arthur's gonna
           make it.

           You should be there for him.
                         
          Other tourists agree.

           It says here `ask about your
           personalised tours'. I want the
           personalised tour. To St. John the

                          NAOMI
           Okay!
                         
                         
          EXT. STREET. DAY
                         
          Arthur comes bounding out of another station. Clutching his
          dollar, he sees a bus. He runs aboard, and up to the driver.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Ah! I'm trying to get to...
                         
          Arthur feels eyes on him. The bus is full of SCHOOL CHILDREN!
          It's a school bus! They all stare for a beat, then get out
          cellphones to report the weirdo in their midst, who runs off
          again and up Broadway, passing a store's line of shopping
          carts. He starts emptying them of quarters.
                         
                          MANAGER
           Hey!
                         
          A police car rounds the corner.
                         
                          POLICEMAN
                          (INTO MIC)
           Uh, unit 6J, we have reports of an
           indecent exposure on a school bus.
                         
          Arthur jumps in a shopping cart; as the truck passes, he
          launches forward, grabbing the rear fender!
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Burt gets up, squeezing past TIGER WOODS.
                         
                         
          EXT. CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Arthur's cab pulls up outside the church, surrounded by
          ONLOOKERS AND PAPARAZZI. Arthur leaps out and fights his way
          through the crowd. People start to recognise the crazed,
          sweating panting weirdo in underwear. Paparazzi and
          pedestrians photograph and film him. He runs into the church.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The church is packed with THE GREAT, GOOD, RICH AND FAMOUS.
          Vivienne sits waiting. Arthur stumbles in at the back.
           109.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Arthur's trying to inch along the back. But the congregation
          falls silent, watching him. He stumbles up the aisle, looking
          up to Jesus, in similar scantily-clad appearance, on a cross.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'm not him.
           (shows his wrists)
           Look ma! No holes.
                         
          Arthur slips in a side door.
                         
                         
          INT. SACRISTY - DAY
                         
          Susan is sitting, sad, Bridesmaids comforting her.
                         
           ARTHUR (O.S.)
           Susan?
                         
          Susan turns and is shocked to see Arthur.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Arthur? What's going on?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Susan. I can't...I can't...
                         
          He leads her away from the bridesmaids.
                         
                          SUSAN
           What?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           The girl at the party? The one who
           talked all that rubbish about
           Coffee Mate? I love her.
                         
          Susan slaps Arthur. Hard.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Shut up! We're getting married!
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But I don't love you!
                         
                          SUSAN
           And you think I love you?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Well, yes. What's not to...
           110.
                         
                         
                          SUSAN
           I never have.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Susan, you're upset, you hate me.
           It's okay. Now I'm sorry, I have to
           go, or your dad's going to do
           whatever he did to your boyfriend
           from college.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Daddy never hurt Alex. He paid her
           parents to send her away..
                         
                          ARTHUR
           HER? You're..a...
                         
                          SUSAN
           Lesbian. Yes. You may have noticed
           that daddy is homophobic. He swore
           he'd disown me if it happened
           again.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           But...why do you want to marry...
                         
          Arthur glances across, sees Erica skulking.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Hang on. Am I your beard?
                         
                          SUSAN
           Why else do you think I'd spend
           more than 30 seconds in your
           company? You're the perfect cover.
                         
                          ARTHUR
                          (REELING)
           Have you been pretending to like
           Dane Cook as well?
                         
                          SUSAN
           No.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Wow. Wow. Well. Uh...
           (heads to the door)
           Thanks for your honesty. I don't
           feel so bad about calling this off.
                         
          Erica steps in his way.
           111.
                         
                         
                          SUSAN
           Arthur, please. You can drink as
           much as you like, sneak off to
           Naomi. We keep the money. We live
           our lives. Everyone wins.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I may be a weak, pathetic drunk.
           But I won't marry a lesbian Dane
           Cook fan.
                         
          Arthur pushes past Erica.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH. ALTAR - NIGHT
                         
          Arthur stumbles out on the altar. The CONGREGATION stares. He
          taps a mic from the pulpit like a stand up.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Good evening, St. John the Divine!
           Anyone in from St. Patrick's?
           Bialystoker Synagogue? Manhattan
           Mosque? AA?
                         
                         
          EXT. CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Naomi's tour bus screeches up. She hurries out.
                         
                         
          SINT. CHURCH - DAY
                         
          Arthur's still before the congregation, telling a story.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           ...and the first turned to the
           second horse and said `That dog
           just spoke'.
                         
          The hateful silence that only 500 angry rich people can
          muster.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           The joke being that it's
           inconsistent that the horses can
           speak but the dog can't.
                         
          Naomi creeps in at the back.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           The wedding's off. The bride has
           had second thoughts. I can't say I
           blame her. Would you marry me?
                          (MORE)
           112.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                          (PAUSE)
           You won't be seeing me again, as
           I'm going to be poor. I'll be
           shopping at the 99 Cent Store. Six
           pork chops for under a dollar!
                         
          TIGER WOODS discreetly scribbles `99c Store, chops' on a torn-
          out Bible page.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Great. I'm glad we had this talk.
           I'll let you get on with the
           wedding....
                         
          A huge crucifix strikes Arthur hard. Burt, crazed with
          hatred, drags him by his hair off the altar.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH. SACRISTY. DAY - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Burt is bashing Arthur's head HARD against a stone font.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Daddy, no! Stop it!
                         
          Vivienne bursts in. Followed by Naomi.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Burt! Get off my son!
                         
          But nothing's going to stop Burt.
                         
                          SUSAN
           (louder than anyone yet)
           DADDY!!!
                         
          Susan is over Burt, brandishing a Virgin Mary statue.
                         
                          BURT
           You wouldn't hurt me.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Wouldn't I? You crushed me.
                         
                          BURT
           I just wanted you to be happy.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Bullshit. You wanted to stop me
           being a lesbian!
                         
                          BURT
           Shut up! Shut up you dirty little
           dyke harlot!
           113.
                         
                         
          Erica leaps on Burt, pummelling his face with her fists.
                         
                          ERICA
           You want some more, bitch? Huh?
                         
          Arthur looks up at Susan.
                         
                          SUSAN
           Erica, that's enough, honey.
                         
          Erica stops. Susan kisses her.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Why didn't you tell me? We could
           have worked something out.
                         
          Naomi give Arthur a look.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           I'm joking.
                         
                         
          INT. CHURCH - LATER
                         
          The church is empty, apart from Arthur and Naomi on the
          altar. Naomi's trying to remove something from Arthur's neck.
          Vivienne is sitting alone in a pew near the back.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           OW! Stop it! Why are you doing
           that?
                         
                          NAOMI
           Because I hate an infection! Keep
           still.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           No, you keep still.
                         
          He kisses Naomi passionately.
                         
                          NAOMI
           What are we going to do, Arthur?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I'll get a job. I'll model cheap
           riding boots for people with no

                          VIVIENNE
           Stop this!
                         
          Vivienne walks up to the altar.
           114.
                         
                         
                          VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
           A Bach-Templemead has never been
           poor and we're not about to try
           that experiment with you, Arthur.
           That said, you've shown strength of
           character for once, instead of
           blubbing on about frogs and
           friendship. The inheritance is
           yours. All I ask is, with Hobson
           gone, you finally start treating me
           like a mother.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sorry, Vivienne. I can't do that.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           I beg your pardon?
                         
                          ARTHUR
           You've never earned that title. I
           wouldn't fake it with Susan. I
           won't with you.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur. I will withdraw this offer
           forever. Don't doubt me, boy.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           I don't.
                         
          Arthur shakes Vivienne's hand.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
           Take care, Viv.
                         
          Arthur takes Naomi by the hand and they leave the church.
                         
                          VIVIENNE
           Arthur! Arthur! I am serious! If
           you walk out of that door...
                         
          They're gone. Vivienne sits in a pew. For once she looks
          small, old, alone.

          Arthur and Naomi step into the daylight, pushing past
          paparazzi and press. Marty is waiting in the Batmobile, now
          repaired.
           115.
                         
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Sorry, Marty. This isn't mine any
           more. Fancy joining us for a bowl
           of Special J?
                         
          Marty gets out. The three walk away up Amsterdam Avenue.

          Naomi's typing, sipping `Sprike' (fake Sprite). Beside her is
          a printed manuscript titled `SNART'S FAKE NEW YORK - A Bogus
          guide to the World's Greatest City.' On the computer screen
          is: `...the 1765 Irish Hair Famine swept through Manhattan,

          Arthur's struggling with a very crap, piddly shower. Rather
          than the glory of Manhattan from his shower-in-the-sky,
          Arthur just has a bare wall opposite to look out on.
                         
                          ARTHUR
           Operational heat controls in a
           shower are a basic human right!
                         
          A hole in a pipe sprays his groin with hot water. He screams.

           Owww! My eyes! I'm blind!
                         
          Ralph hammers again. The bathroom door opens. Arthur's
          holding a giant bottle of cheap shampoo. His eyes are bright
          red, streaming.
                         
                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)

          Naomi appears from the bedroom. She finds Arthur staring at
          a framed photo of Hobson as a beautiful young woman holding
          Arthur as a happy, laughing toddler. A note is attached.

                          RALPH

                            Written by

                       Michel Hazanavicius




    Silent film, illustrated musically, with some title cards to
    indicate the dialogues, with actors whose lips move when they
    speak although we never hear their voices. The images are in
    black and white, in format 1.33.


1   TITLES                                                       1

    The letters of the titles come up on a title card typical of
    the 1920s. Elegant motifs around the edge of the frame, and,
    in the background, there are geometrical shapes reminiscent
    of the light beams of a film première. Behind is a stylized
    town. The titles end in a fade to black. On black, the date
    appears on the screen: 1927


2   INT. LABORATORY - DAY                                        2

    In a "futuristic" 1920s laboratory, a man in tail coat and
    bow tie is being tortured. Ultrasound is being piped into his
    ears. It's incredibly painful! He's screaming.

    Title card:
    I'm not telling!   I won't talk!!!

    His torturers, cold men of science in white coats, gradually
    increase the volume. The pain seems unbearable, the volume
    reaches level 10 (maximum), the man passes out!


3   INT. CELLS & CORRIDORS - DAY                                 3

    Guards wearing long leather overcoats throw the man into a
    cell!

    As the man is lying there on the ground, a dog wiggles
    through the bars at the window. The dog, a Jack Russell,
    jumps on top of the man - visibly his master - and begins to
    lick his face. The man opens one eye! When he sees his dog,
    he can't help cracking a smile...

    The man, now on his feet, looks in pain. Despite the pain, he
    motions to his dog who begins to bark in lively fashion.

    Outside the cell, the guard looks curious about the noise. He
    goes to the door, opens the spy flap and finds himself face
    to face with the man, eye to eye just a couple of inches
    apart! The man moves his eyes in such a way that he
    hypnotizes the guard! Superimposed on the screen: a spinning
    black and white spiral, until the dazed guard take his keys,
    opens the door and releases the man and his dog.
                                                                 2.


    The man (the hero, thus) imprisons the guard without harming
    him, then runs over to the guard's desk. His ears are still
    causing him pain, but he opens a drawer and takes out his
    belongings: a top hat which he snaps open, and a mask, which
    he puts over his head to conceal his eyes.

    We catch up with the masked man walking down corridors. He
    suddenly stops, copied by his dog who follows him like his
    shadow. The man, on his guard, has spotted another guard
    where two corridors meet.

    With a look, he orders his dog to move forwards into the
    guard's line of sight. The guard looks over at the animal.
    Using his fingers, the hero pretends to shoot his dog. The
    dog collapses, plays dead. The guard, increasingly curious,
    gets to his feet. He slowly approaches the motionless dog.
    When he comes close he is attacked from the side by the hero,
    who quickly puts him out of action with a mere punch!

    The masked man then rushes to another cell, and releases a
    young female prisoner. She too is wearing evening dress. As
    she is thanking him he staggers and clutches his ears in
    pain. She's concerned.

    Title card:
    Can I help you in some way?

    He refuses.

    Title card:
    No. I don't get helped.   I give the help around here.

    He composes himself. She casts him an admiring glance. Then,
    in view of the urgency of their situation, they escape at a
    run.


4   EXT. HOUSE/LABORATORY - DAY                                       4

    They come out of a house that is lost in the hills, climb
    into a Bugatti sports car that the man starts by rubbing two
    wires together, and speed off.


5   EXT. ROAD - DAY                                                   5

    The car speeds along the road. Its occupants turn round to
    check they aren't being followed.
                                                              3.


6   INT. HOUSE/LAB - DAY                                           6

    The guard who got knocked out picks himself up, realizes what's
    happened and dashes over to his office. He grabs a radio
    emitter and begins sending a message.


7   EXT. AIR FIELD - DAY                                           7

    The hero, the young woman and the dog come to a halt in the
    Bugatti on the air field, by a telegraph pole whose wires
    lead...to a watch tower.

    In the watch tower, a radio receptor is vibrating. A soldier
    approaches, listens and suddenly understands! He grabs hold of
    his gun and goes out onto the air field, only to find the
    fugitives! He tries to shoot at them as he draws closer, but
    the hero manages to throw an airplane propeller at him, before
    climbing inside where the woman and dog are waiting for him.

    The airplane begins to move.

    The soldier shoots.

    The airplane is positioning itself on the runway, while the
    soldier continues to fire!

    The aircraft gains speed.

    The soldier is still shooting, but too late, as the heroo pulls
    back the joystick, and the airplane takes to the sky...

    The soldier is furious, but the hero is all smiles as he looks
    back towards the ground and shouts something.

    Title card: Free Georgia forever!!!

    The airplane flies away into the evening sky.


8   EXT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT                                          8

    A little later in the night, still at the controls, the man is
    fighting not to fall asleep. Behind him, the women is sleeping,
    the dog is lying in her arms. Suddenly she is awoken by
    explosions happening close by! Pandemonium! The man doesn't
    understand it either, he tries to pick up altitude, but quickly
    notices that the explosions are in fact pretty and
    inoffensive. He consults a calendar dial on the control panel
    that shows it is July 14th, immediately understands, and
    bursts into laughter.

    Title card: We've arrived, welcome to France!!!
                                                               4.


     As the music picks up the tune of The Marseillaise, the
     airplane flies away through the exploding fireworks...

     The words "The End" appear on the screen.


9    INT. WINGS MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                   9

     From the moment they parked the car onwards, we become
     absorbed by what's happening around the screening of end of
     this film.

     Behind the screen, we've seen the actor who plays the hero -
     his name is George Valentin - closely studying the reactions
     of the audience. He was standing close to his dog, motioning
     to it not to make a noise. The dog's name is Jack.

     In the same area, we've also seen the lead actress. Her name
     is Constance Gray. She too looks tense and is latched onto
     the arm of a pleasant-looking man who is chewing anxiously on
     a cigar. The man looks rich, but a little weak. He's surely
     the producer.


10   INT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                     10

     In the house, much of the audience is open-mouthed, excited,
     immobile and often wide-eyed.

     In the pit, a symphony orchestra plays to accompany the film.

     (9) Now that the film is ending, and the last note is
     sounding, the cast anxiously awaits the audience's verdict,
     which, after two or three seconds of silence, bursts into
     thunderous applause, to the great joy of the actor and the
     people around him, especially the actress and the producer,
     who kiss each other on the lips.

     Two theater hands bring down the curtain.

     (10) The lights come on. George Valentin comes onto the stage
     and acknowledges the audience, they are cheering for him. He
     is so happy he dances a few tap steps to express his joy then
     he acknowledges the orchestra before finally motioning to
     someone in the wings to join him. Jack the dog trots over in
     response. The crowd laughs and cheers, George waves to the
     dog, Jack waves back then waves at the audience, the people
     are loving it!

     In the wings, Constance is fuming with rage, but on stage,
     George is pretending with his fingers to pull at the dog, who
     fakes death. Thunderous applause again.
                                                               5.


     Behind the actress, the producer can't hold back a smile, and
     this enrages the actress still more.

     Suddenly, George, hamming it up, remembers something he'd
     forgotten, and asks someone from the other side of the wings
     to join him. It's Constance. She comes over, smiling to the
     audience, and says something to George with a smile.

     Title card: I'll get you for that.

     She waves, but we can tell that her smile is set between her
     teeth. She isn't feeling comfortable. George motions firing a
     gun with his fingers, but she does not fall down, merely
     casts him a "very funny" glance. George looks at his fingers,
     not understanding why they don't work anymore then mimes
     throwing them away behind him, as though they've become
     useless. Constance stalks back off into the wings in
     annoyance, but the audience is ecstatic. Once in the wings,
     the actress sticks up her middle finger at George, and
     exaggeratedly mouths so he can read her lips: "Put this up
     your ass." George, grinning broadly, responds by clapping his
     hands in applause, then leaves the stage, executing a few
     more dance steps as he does so. The audience is delighted.

     As he comes off stage, George gets soundly told off by
     Constance, but, still grinning, he motions towards the
     audience who are still asking for more. The producer,
     although delighted by the successful reception, makes a weak
     attempt to calm the actress down. As for George, he returns
     to the stage, the audience roars. He pretends to want to
     leave the stage, and mimes bumping into an invisible wall
     just as he's leaving the stage. George holds his nose, the
     audience goes wild, Constance gets even madder, and while
     George carries on clowning about, the producer too breaks
     into a beaming smile. He's probably realized that George has
     the audience on his side... Constance, furious, storms off. She
     is followed by the producer who is trying to placate her,
     although it looks like he's got his work cut out for him.


11   EXT. MOVIE THEATER LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                      11

     Outside, we are in front of a typically American movie theater
     decked out with all the accessories of a grand première. The
     entrance is lit up, there are crowds gathered on the sidewalk,
     cops are guarding the red carpet with a cordon of bodies, etc.

     George comes out, causing the crowds, mainly young women, to
     press forwards - and the photographers' flashes to spark into
     life. The cops are struggling to maintain control of the
     situation as George poses for the photographers and waves at
     his many fans.
                                                               6.


     In the crowd, a young woman right at the front is staring at
     him in rapture. She drops her bag and, as she bends to pick it
     up, a swell in the crowd pushes her underneath the arms of the
     policeman in front of her, out of the crowd and into George.
     She stares at him, more in love than ever, delighted to be
     there. The police wait for someone to give orders. George
     doesn't quite know what to do. Nobody moves. The young woman
     finally bursts out laughing, which, after a moment of shock,
     causes George to laugh too, thus placating the cops and tacitly
     signaling to the photographers that they can take pictures of
     the scene. The flashes seem to lend the woman self-confidence
     who, in a very carefree manner, begins to clown about in front
     of them. George is delighted at the sight, by the whole scene
     and, realizing this, the young woman steals a kiss. Flash. The
     image becomes static, then dissolves into the printed picture
     on the front page of "The Hollywood Reporter" newspaper, along
     with three other pictures of the scene and the headline WHO'S
     THAT GIRL?


12   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           12

     The very same newspaper is being read by an elegant woman
     sitting at a sumptuous breakfast table. We are in the large
     dining room of an ultra-luxurious Hollywood villa. All around
     her are magnificent furniture, superb paintings and objets
     d'art, including a beautiful trio of monkeys, one hiding its
     eyes, one with hands clasped to its ears and the third
     obscuring its mouth. George comes into the room and kisses
     his wife. She responds with cold indifference. You could cut
     the atmosphere with a knife. The woman hands George the
     newspaper. He knows what's up but tries to laugh it off. She
     doesn't find it funny, is as cold as stone and barely looks
     at him. She is obviously extremely annoyed with him. George
     picks up his dog and puts it on the table. Jack drops his
     head to one side and his big eyes implore seem to implore her
     forgiveness. It's the exact expression of someone asking to
     be loved, but Doris is implacable. She gets up, walks away
     and does not turn back. Left on his own, George has a closed
     expression on his face. He seems unhappy to have hurt his
     wife's feelings. Then he realizes that Jack is on the table
     in a ridiculous pose, and signals to him to get down. The dog
     obeys. George looks at the paper, the cause of his problems.


13   EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREET BUS - DAY                            13

     Thirteen white letters placed on a hillside.

     HOLLYWOODLAND.

     Below, in town, a bus.
                                                               7.


14   INT. BUS (DRIVING)/HOLLYWOOD - DAY                           14

     Inside the full bus is the young woman from the day before. Her
     name is Peppy Miller. She is proudly holding "The Hollywood
     Reporter" with her face on the front page, and is more or less
     discreetly making suggestive glances, hoping that someone
     recognizes her. But the people around her - from working and
     middle class backgrounds - are visibly on their way to work and
     remain impervious to her game.

     She - carefully - puts the paper away in her bag, in which four
     or five copies of the newspaper are already carefully tucked
     away, then gets off the bus at the next stop.


15   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 15

     She goes through the main gates of Kinograph Studios, and
     heads towards where they hire extras.

     In a courtyard, fifty-odd people are waiting, some sitting on
     wooden crates, others standing. There are mums with kids,
     guys with animals, men dressed as cowboys, etc. Peppy is
     among them, sitting next to a man of about sixty who is
     dressed in a highly stylized fashion. His job is obviously
     that of a butler. Peppy proudly shows him the picture in the
     newspaper. The man leans to take a closer look, unfolds the
     newspaper, sees the headline, smiles and then folds it back
     up again and returns it to Peppy text-side-up, highlighting
     the headline: Who's that girl ?

     Peppy is a bit annoyed to have been put in her place, but
     deep down she knows he's right. Nobody knows who she is. She
     puts the newspaper away.

     A man who visibly works for the studio, some assistant or
     other, comes into the courtyard, climbs on a crate and makes
     an announcement.

     Title card: Contemporary film!   Five girls who can dance!

     All the men who had pressed forwards turn on their heels,
     leaving the assistant surrounded only by women. The man says
     something to one girl, who begins to dance. He motions to her
     that it's ok and she heads off towards the wardrobe section.
     He does the same with a second girl and she gets hired too.
     Then it's Peppy's turn. She puts a lot of energy into a few
     top class tap steps, impressing the guy to such an extent
     that he smiles admiringly then signals that she's hired.

     Full of self-assurance that her lucky day has come, Peppy
     heads off towards wardrobe too; swinging, her hips as she
     pauses in front of the butler.
                                                                  8.


      Title card: The name is Miller.    Peppy Miller!

      She finishes with an exaggerated wink, before walking on,
      leaving behind the impassive butler.


16A   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                            16A

      In the lobby, George is preparing to leave the house. He
      waves at the huge, full-length portrait of himself waving and
      smiling whilst wearing a tuxedo. He looks great in the
      painting, and George is delighted to see and to wave to
      himself.


16    EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                 16

      Later, George, in a luxurious car driven by his chauffeur,
      arrives at the Kinograph studios with his dog. The guard at the
      entrance smiles broadly at them and waves.


17    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY       17

      As he walks towards his dressing room, everyone smiles at him.
      He's not always fooled by these signs of respect, and apes a
      few smiles himself.


18    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY        18

      In his dressing room, wearing a tailcoat and top hat, George
      is finishing putting his make up on. He has a white face and
      dark lips and eyes. His chauffeur is signing autographs for
      him on full length photographs of himself (George) with his
      dog. George says to him:

      Title card: Go and buy a piece of jewelry for my wife. A nice
      piece, to make it up to her.

      The chauffeur nods. Having finished his mask up, George,
      picks up a photo, looks at it closely and then writes on it.
      As he leaves the dressing room, we see the photograph. He's
      written Woof Woof on it, and signed it with the paw print of
      a dog.


19    INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY          19

      We're on a film set, the crew is setting up a shot. The
      director is unhappy with a screen positioned behind a bay
      window and he sends it off.
                                                           9.


Title card: Remove that screen and bring me another one!    On
the double!

Two hands pick up the screen and carry it away. George
arrives on set, everyone smiles at him. He sits down on the
chair which bears his name. The producer whom we saw the
previous day at the première arrives. His name is Zimmer, and
he's flanked by - and followed around at every moment by -
two secretaries and two assistants. One of them hands him The
Hollywood Reporter, and Zimmer, before he's even come to a
halt, talks to George as he shows him the front page. He is
visibly upset. George looks a lot more relaxed, he says hello
and vaguely tries to reassure him. But Zimmer persists, still
pointing at the newspaper.

Title card: Because of this childish nonsense, there's
nothing about the film before page 5!

Behind George, the two set hands come back with a new screen
of sky scenery, and wait, standing just next to George. As
they are holding it, there is a three foot gap underneath.
While the producer is talking to him, George's attention is
drawn by a lovely pair of women's legs that have come to
stand behind the screen, the top half of the body being
hidden by it. George acknowledges the sight with a smile and
is about to bring his attention back to the on-going
discussion, when his attention is drawn away again by a
noise, that of the tap steps the female legs are making,
presumably as a warm up. George smiles in recognition and
responds with a few tap steps of his own. The women's legs
instantly stop, seem to think a moment and then answer back,
but with a jump in the complexity of the steps. A tap
dialogue ensues between the two pairs of legs, until the set
hands - the path before them now cleared - pick up their
screen of scenery and walk off with it. The screen moves away
and as it disappears reveals that the upper body belongs to a
young woman. She pulls a face meaning 'Here I am!!' And of
course it's Peppy, except that she immediately realizes who
she is dealing with - visibly she wasn't expecting this at
all - and feels completely ridiculous and uncomfortable.

Her joyful expression gradually becomes one of abject
apology, but George is roaring with laughter.

After a short pause, Zimmer makes the connection. He checks
the front page of the paper, and recognizes her!

Then he begins shouting at her and all she can do is lower
her head, unable to reply. He gestures that she's fired and
for her to get out, and she starts to go, completely
distraught. She's just made a couple of steps when George
stops her and tells her to come back. Everyone is surprised,
most of all him. Zimmer can't believe it, and so doesn't
respond at first.
                                                              10.


     There's bad feeling between them, as though neither wanted
     this sudden conflict, but like it had always been there,
     tangible. Everyone on the set seems to be waiting for Zimmer
     to react, but to their surprise, after a long moment of
     hesitation, he walks away without saying a thing. Peppy looks
     at George gratefully, smiling, but seems a little preoccupied
     as though she might have made a mistake.

     Everyone on set gets back to work.


20   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - RESTAURANT DECOR SET - DAY        20

     They're about to start shooting. The director is showing
     George what he has to do. The scene is happening in a cabaret
     restaurant. George has to cross a dance floor, but each time he
     is stopped by a guy ringing a bell to signal it is time to
     change dancing partner. George finds himself dancing with
     Peppy one moment, and in the arms of a very fat man the next,
     the director finds the gag hysterical. The scene is shot
     several times from three different angles. Each time, George
     dances with Peppy, and, each time, the nature of their rapport
     changes. To begin with, they are happy and laughing, but then,
     with time, less so. Then they become embarrassed, and then
     things get worse. We start the sequence again and again, to the
     sound of the clapperboard counting the number of takes, but the
     eroticism between them is the only thing that stands out from
     the scene, every thing else goes unnoticed. Ultimately, no
     flirting or suggestiveness has gone on, just the very obvious
     beginning of feelings between them that they find disturbing.
     It's probably love.


21   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     21

     Later on, in the dressing room corridor, Peppy, holding an
     envelope, goes up to George's door. She knocks, waits for a
     reply, then enters. There's nobody there. She hesitates, not
     sure whether to leave or stay...


22   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      22

     Finally, she goes into the room and places the envelope
     addressed to George Valentin on the dresser. Then she
     attentively looks around the dressing room. She looks at the
     objects and photos and notices, hanging from a coat stand,
     George's jacket on a hanger, and his hat which sits on a hook
     above it. The way the clothes are disposed looks like George's
     silhouette, except that the clothes are empty. She goes over,
     strokes the jacket and little by little brings George to life
     through his clothes.
                                                              11.


     She puts her right hand into the sleeve and touches her own
     waist. As it's George's sleeve, she makes it look like his arm
     has come to life, as though George has come to life. Even more
     so since her left hand is stroking the jacket as though George
     were inside. She takes pleasure from the embrace and, when
     George comes into the room, she slowly removes her hand without
     any rush. George sees her, they look at each other. He closes
     the door but doesn't go over to her, instead going over to the
     mirror. He looks at her, she at him... He motions to her to
     approach. She does. He stares at her face for a while before he
     speaks.

     Title card: If you want to be an actress, you need to have
     something no one else has.

     He takes a make-up pencil and draws a beauty spot above her
     upper lip. She looks at herself in the mirror and smiles. She
     likes it. She turns towards him and, quite naturally, folds
     into his arms. The dog watches them curiously with its head
     leaning to one side. They are probably about to kiss when
     George's chauffeur comes into the room and catches them.
     George swiftly moves aside and there is a moment of
     discomfort. The chauffeur unwraps a parcel and takes out a
     large and beautiful pearl necklace. George is intrigued by
     the necklace, and turns away from Peppy. She understands that
     George has his own life, that their embrace was just a stolen
     moment and slowly leaves, looking back at George as she does
     so. He does not look at her. She leaves the room. Once he has
     studied and necklace and is satisfied, George turns back
     towards Peppy but she is no longer there. The chauffeur exits
     the room.

     When he is alone, George looks at himself in the mirror. His
     expression shows that he things he is the stupidest man in
     the world. He mimes shooting himself in the temple with his
     fingers, but it's the dog which collapses into its play-dead
     pose.


23   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             23

     The next morning, he's having breakfast with his wife. The
     atmosphere is still dreadful but this time he's not making any
     effort either. He disdainfully watches Doris eat. She is
     cutting up strawberries using a knife and fork. George watches
     her, smiles and continues to watch. Except it's not Doris he's
     watching. Instead it's Peppy who's tucking into her food and
     talking and laughing vivaciously. George is with her with an
     expression of love on his face. He's laughing with her when,
     suddenly, reality bites. He's still sitting opposite Doris,
     and she's staring at him because she doesn't understand why he
     is laughing. She visibly finds him ridiculous. He stops
     laughing and breakfast carries on as normal.
                                                                 12.


24   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              24

     We see several quick sequences which indicate time passing:

     Breakfasts with George and Doris where the atmosphere is
     increasingly dreadful. Doris scribbles on photos of George in
     the press, draws on moustaches, large spectacles, etc.


25   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PIRATE/COWBOY/ETC. - DAY                 25

     Short extracts of George in various films, in which he portrays
     a pirate, then a cowboy, then William Tell, etc. We also see
     him in "Someday in July" in the sequence he shot with Peppy and
     the fat male dancer.


26   INT. MOVIE THEATER AUDIENCE, ETC. - DAY                       26

     Movie-goers reacting to the films, but the way the images are
     edited - cut with breakfast images - could mean they are
     reacting to them too.

     Among the audience is Peppy Miller. She's trying to
     concentrate fully on the film and is pushing away the handsome
     young man she's with, who is trying to kiss her. We see her
     later, at the movies again, but this time alone.


27   INT. STUDIO/STAGES - PEPPY AS A SERVANT/DANCER/ETC. - DAY     27

     We see her playing some bit parts, maid, dancer, etc. Her roles
     seem to get a little bigger. We notice that she now wears the
     beauty spot that she'll keep forever.

     Her name climbs up the ranks in the title sequences of films,
     until it appears on its own.


28   INT. OFFICE - PEPPY/CONTRACT/1927 - DAY                       28

     We see her signing a contract in a small office, she seems
     happy.


29                                                                 29
     INT. OFFICE - GEORGE/ZIMMER/CONTRACT - DAY

     George signs a big contract with Zimmer as photographers take
     pictures. He smiles broadly, whereas Zimmer looks like his
     smile is a little forced.

     The date appears on the screen: 1929
                                                                13.


30                                                                30
     INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR - DAY

     George, dressed as a musketeer, is sword-fighting with three
     middle-ages thugs in a tavern. He kills two of them, but
     unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third. But when
     the third man attacks, George merely dodges with a sleight of
     body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook!
     Calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a
     mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape.
     The man stands up, throws aside his cape and reveals himself to
     be... Napoleon! He puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly
     thanks an astonished George. Napoleon says something to him
     and George respectfully bows, walks away from him still bowing
     then turns and runs. Once out of the decor, he bumps right into
     a worried-looking Zimmer who is followed by his loyal
     assistants. George is in a playful mood. Zimmer tells him:

     Title Card: I want to show you something.     Right now.

     George seems astonished that Zimmer is leaving the set and
     not filming, but agrees. Napoleon walks past them very
     imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him
     a chair. The technician doesn't miss the chance to remind the
     man that he is only an extra, and not Napoleon.


31                                                                31
     INT. SCREENING ROOM - STUDIO - DAY

     Zimmer, his guards, and George - still dressed as a musketeer -
     come into a screening room in which a dozen or so very serious-
     looking people are waiting. They sit down and Zimmer, very
     proudly and self-confidently, gestures to an assistant who
     passes on the message to the projectionist. The room goes dark.
     The screening begins.


32                                                                32
     INT. VOICE TEST STUDIO - DAY

     On screen we see a card that indicates it's a sound shooting
     test for a talking scene. Then Constance appears, the actress
     from the spy film. She's standing in front of a mic and she
     tests it, delighted to be there. Cut. We see her again, the
     microphone has disappeared and she acts out a scene. It's a
     monologue. Her acting is terrible, very theatrical, but the
     audience can hear her. It is however, awful.

     (31) In the screening room, the audience seems stunned by
     what they see/hear. They are fascinated. They then begin to
     congratulate each other and slap Zimmer on the back. Zimmer's
     pride seems to grow by the second.

     George, who at first seemed very surprised, slowly begins a
     snigger which gradually has become a belly laugh when the
     actress earnestly ends her monologue.
                                                              14.


     When the lights come up, George is laughing uncontrollably
     way beyond the bounds of mere mockery as his sincerity is
     obvious. The people present are embarrassed, and Zimmer is
     deeply put out. George, still laughing, leaves the room,
     waving an apology with his hands as he goes, but also
     pointing to the screen to explain why he's laughing. Zimmer
     feels even more humiliated. Fade to black on his face.


33   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - GEORGE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY      33

     We're back with George in his dressing room. He's removing his
     make up. He moves some ordinary object and the object, as he
     moves it, makes a noise. We hear the noise it makes. Really
     hear it. It's the first time we've heard a sound that comes
     from within the film itself. One second later, George realizes
     that the object made a noise. He moves it again, the object
     makes a noise again. George is worried. He tries another object
     and obtains noise again. His dog barks and we hear it! He gets
     up (chair makes a noise) and says something to his dog, but no
     sound comes out of his mouth when he speaks. He realizes
     this... Panic sets in, he turns to the mirror and tries talking
     again, but still no sound comes out. Not understanding what's
     happening, the feeling of panic fully blossoms and he flees his
     dressing room!


34   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DRESSING ROOM CORRIDORS - DAY     34

     Noisy, laughing dancers pass in the corridor, others are
     talking or shouting and even if we can't make out what they are
     saying, they are all making sound. George tries to talk to them
     but his voice remains silent. One dancer, seeing his fright,
     bursts into throaty laughter. George rushes through the
     milling crowd the sound of which is becoming increasingly
     loud...


35   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - COURTYARD - DAY                   35

     ...and bursts out into the courtyard of the studio that is now
     suddenly deserted and silent. In front of him a feather eddies
     slowly to the ground, carried by the breeze. It finally lands,
     making a completely abnormal and disproportionate noise like
     that of a building crashing to the ground in slow motion.
     George screams, but again his cry is silent.


36   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT               36

     George awakes with a start! He's in bed and is having trouble
     shaking off his nightmare.

     The film continues as normal: in other words, silent.
                                                               15.


     His wife is sleeping by his side. He gets up, taking care not
     to make a sound.


37   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            37

     George calms down as he sits in the living room, alone in the
     darkness. Jack, still sleepy, has just curled into a ball
     next to him to fall back to sleep. George smiles and gives
     him a pat.


38   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY     38

     Driven by his chauffeur, George crosses town heading for the
     studios.


39                                                               39
     EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY

     The car goes through the studio gates. There's nobody there.
     George gets out. He goes into the courtyard. There's nobody
     there either.


40   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - TAVERN DECOR SET - DAY             40

     He goes into the studio and heads for the set. There is still
     no one about. He doesn't understand and goes back outside.


41   EXT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - DAY                                41

     Outside in the deserted courtyard, a feather eddies towards
     the ground, carried by the breeze. George is watching it drift
     to the ground when suddenly a gust of wind sends it soaring
     back into the sky. George follows it with his eyes and notices
     a man crossing between two sets. He looks like some kind of set
     hand or assistant; a working man in any case. George calls to
     him. The two men draw close and George asks him what's
     happening. The man takes the day's newspaper out of his pocket
     and hands it to George before walking off. George reads:
     Kinograph Studios stop all silent productions to work
     exclusively on talkies.


42   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY           42

     Despite the secretary's attempts to stop him, a furious George
     storms into Zimmer's office.
                                                              16.


43   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY                43

     Zimmer is in a meeting with some men. They are probably
     engineers in view of the attention being given to the plans
     lying on the desk. Everyone is surprised by George's rude
     entry. The engineers seem embarrassed, but Zimmer smiles and
     politely asks them to leave, as though asking for their
     understanding. As they head for the door, some of them drop
     their heads so as not to meet George's eyes, whereas others
     look him right between the eyes but without any love lost. This
     exchange causes a strange, unpleasant feeling within him. He
     seems embarrassed. It's perhaps due to the rudeness of his
     eruption into the office, but it's more likely due to the looks
     he's been given. For the first time for ages, he has not been
     looked at how a star is normally looked at - with respect,
     desire and admiration - but like any ordinary man is looked at
     or, worse still, how a superfluous man is looked at.

     As George realizes that his status has just changed, Zimmer
     invites him to sit down. Then speaks to him, in a friendly
     manner.

     Title card: We belong to another age, you and I, George.
     Nowadays, the world talks.

     He talks to him, looks a little embarrassed, while George
     takes it on the chin, not knowing how to respond.

     Title card: People want to see new faces. Talking faces.

     George reaches deep down into himself and makes an effort to
     bring up a smile.

     Title card: Paramount will be delighted. They still want me.

     Zimmer responds with a pursing of the lips that is more
     damning than any counter argument could be. As though he's
     telling George he can always give it a go... George understands
     what's happening. Zimmer is sorry.

     Title card: I'm sorry. The public wants fresh blood. And the
     public is never wrong.

     George gets to his feet.

     Title card: It's me the people want and it's my films they
     want to see. And I'm going to give them to them.

     Zimmer nods with another pursing of the lips, as though he
     can't wait to see that. George seems very sure of himself.

     Title card: I don't need you. Go make your talking movies.
     I'm going to make them a beautiful film!
                                                              17.


     As George leaves in disgust, his eyes are drawn to an
     advertising feature representing the "new faces of Kinograph
     Studios". Among the medallion framed young portraits, George
     recognizes that of Peppy Miller. He glances up at Zimmer.

     Title card: Fresh blood...

     The two men exchange a last glance, then George exits.


44   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS, SECRETARY'S OFFICE - DAY            44

     Outside he feels a few seconds of discouragement but, as he
     meets the gaze of the engineers waiting in the secretary's
     antechamber, he puffs up his chest and walks tall out of the
     office.


45   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - STAIRS - DAY                       45

     Going down the stairs from the offices, he passes a laughing
     Peppy who is accompanied by two young and charming men, perfect
     specimens of America's golden youth. She is coming up, he is
     going down. When she notices him, she stops, already one step
     above of him. She has a beaming smile and is truly delighted to
     see him. He is delighted too, although his mood is very
     different.

     Title card (him): How are you?

     Title card (her): Fantastic! I've been given a lead role!
     Isn't it wonderful?!

     He nods, we see in his eyes that he's terribly happy for her.
     They look at each other, she laughs.

     Then she fumbles in her bag for something with which to note
     down her telephone number on a piece of paper. It takes a
     while and is a little chaotic, she apologizes, but he visibly
     takes a lot of pleasure out of watching her. She finally gets
     the number down and hands it to him, telling him to call her -
     to really call her. In response he casts a glance over to the
     young men waiting for her higher up the stairs, and she
     bursts out laughing. She leans towards him to say something.

     Title card: Gadgets!

     She looks at him flirtatiously. Then she gestures again for
     him to call her, and he nods, even though we think that he
     probably will not do so. She leaves and he watches her go
     before beginning his decent once more. Once at the top, she
     turns back to call out to George, he too has turned to look.
     She smiles at him, breaks into a few tap steps for old time's
     sake, then blows him a kiss.
                                                              18.


     He catches the kiss with a smile, pretends to make it
     disappear in his other hand like a magician, then shows her
     the inside breast pocket of his jacket as proof that he's
     keeping it safe and warm. She laughs loudly and goes on her
     way. He watches her walk away with admiration in his eyes.
     She vanishes and George's smile takes on a note of
     melancholy, and then he leaves too.

47   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           47

     George comes home. Doris is there scribbling on a magazine but
     he takes no notice of her. When the dog jumps into his arms
     however, he greets it affectionately. Doris is vexed.


48   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY             48

     A while later he's running Jack through his tricks when Doris
     arrives.

     Title card: We have to talk, George.

     George smiles.

     Title card: Or not.

     She insists but he doesn't listen. He's with his dog. She
     gets annoyed, he doesn't answer, she ends up throwing Jack.
     George cannot forgive her for doing so, he looks at her in
     disgust. She starts to cry.

     Title card: I'm unhappy, George.

     He answers without looking at her.

     Title card: So are millions of other people, me for instance.


49   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              49

     Thanks to a montage of shot frames, photos and press cuttings,
     we see George begin making his film, the first clap of the
     board that shows he's both the film's producer and director.
     The film is called Tears of love, and it tells the tale of an
     English adventurer - played by himself - accompanied by a young
     woman, an old man who looks like a professor and who is
     probably the father of the young woman and, lastly, an African
     tribe represented as savages and whose humanity remains to be
     proven.
                                                              19.


     We see George in the various stages of preparation: writing, re-
     writing, directing, acting, signing a lot of checks, but also
     leaving very early in the morning to set up shots with his
     collaborators, etc. He looks fulfilled, like he truly believes
     in what he's doing, despite the tiredness he's feeling. His dog
     has a role in the film too, doing tricks. George looks very
     happy, very committed. He takes a supple branch, feeds it
     through the sleeves of a woman's blouse and, by holding the two
     ends of the branch out in front of him, dances with the
     imaginary woman. Everyone around him is happy and laughing.
     He's not shooting a comedy, however, it's obviously a drama of
     some sort from what we see of the set and the way the actors
     play their role.

     Then appear on screen the mock ups of posters, they are shown
     on the set to George.

     He chooses the one in which he is most prominent, it's a poster
     depicting a cutesy melodrama and bears the release date
     October 25th.


50                                                              50
     OMITTED


51   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET (POSTERS) - DAY                    51

     In the street, at the entrance to a movie theater, George sees
     a large "Beauty Spot" film poster. The poster shows Peppy close
     up, wearing a magnificent and jauntily positioned chapka over
     one eye. She is incredibly stylish but in no way vampish, more
     the image of a young comedy debut... George looks at her, Peppy
     seems to be smiling at him. He smiles back. Then his smile
     becomes strained. He's noticed something. The two theater
     employees are sticking a banner over the poster that reveals
     the release date of Beauty Spot - it's also October 25th.


52   INT. ANIMATION STAND - DAY                                 52

     Then we see advertising inserts and full page press articles
     appearing one after the other, creating a montage of images
     with a very 1920's feel. "Get some Peps with Peppy!" and a
     close up on her smiling, mischievous face. "The girl next
     door", "The girl you'll love to love" "Young and pretty", etc.
     with a photo of Peppy each time, posters of the film and then,
     everywhere, the face that it's a talking movie! Talking,
     talking, talking!

     As for George, his image is a lot more austere, the photographs
     show him as very serious. And the captions are like: "I'm not a
     muppet anymore, I'm an artist!"
                                                              20.

54   INT. RESTAURANT INTERVIEW - DAY                              54

     We're in a smart restaurant. George has his back to the room
     and is eating with his chauffeur. Peppy comes into the
     restaurant and comes to sit just behind George. They are back
     to back. She is with several young men, two of whom are
     journalists and they are interviewing her.

     Title card: Your first film doesn't come out until tomorrow
     and yet you're already the new darling of Hollywood! How do
     you explain that?

     She starts by bursting into laughter, which draws George's
     attention. He turns round to listen to the rest of Peppy's
     answer.

     Title card: I don't know, maybe it's because I talk. And
     people hear me.

     She continues talking, obviously happy that people are
     interested in her. She doesn't see George smiling behind her.

     Title card: People are sick to death of those old actors who
     pull faces to make themselves understood.

     She continues talking with the casual arrogance of youth.
     Behind her, George's smile vanishes.

     Title card: Anyway, it's normal for the young to take over
     from the old, that's life. Make way for youth!

     George is hurt. He gets up and, before he leaves, gestures
     silently that if she wants his place all she has to do is
     take it. She watches him leave and immediately regrets what
     she's just said.


55   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                             55

     It's the day of the films' release, October 25th.

     It's morning. George opens his front door. His chauffeur is
     outside. The man's expression announces bad news. He's holding
     the day's press. The huge headlines talk of a stock market
     crash, a black Thursday, a catastrophe.

     Dressed in a robe, George is on the telephone in the living
     room. He nods. The atmosphere is stifling. He hangs up. His
     chauffeur looks at him inquisitively. George replies as though
     lost in thought:
                                                              21.


     Title card: It would seem that we're ruined.

     The chauffeur takes it on the chin with as much reserve as he
     can muster, but George continues.

     Title card: That's the best case scenario...

     He almost laughs - not so the chauffeur.


56   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                           56

     Now wearing a suit, George is sitting at his desk. Lying in
     front of him are the front pages of newspapers reporting the
     Crash. He looks for something on the inside pages of one paper
     and reads. Next to a large picture of Peppy there's a review of
     his own film, beginning "Tears of Love, Old and Boring". He
     shuts the paper and searches for something in the drawer of his
     desk. He takes out a piece of paper. It's the telephone number
     that Peppy had scribbled down for him. He looks at it, moves
     closer to the telephone, hesitates, looks at the paper again,
     then puts the scrap of paper back in the drawer without making
     the call.


57   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                         57

     Peppy awakes in bed with a start. She doesn't know what has
     woken her up. She looks around, looks at the phone, seems
     perplexed. Then a man's arm invites her to lie back down; she
     does.

     (56) Still at his desk, George gets up and goes to the
     window. He seems lost in thought.


58   INT. GEORGE'S STUDIO SET - JUNGLE DECOR - DAY              58

     An extract from "Tears of Love" in which we see George, holding
     the young woman in his arms, take part in a cliché-d African
     dance with shields, spears and all the African accoutrements
     attributed by Westerners at the time. George and the woman are
     complacently watching the dance, when George says to the young
     woman.

     Title card: Let's go back, Norma. They've never seen a white
     woman before and I don't want to take any risks.


59   INT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" SCREENING - DAY       59

     There's hardly anyone in the theater. The people that are there
     look bored more than anything. At the back smoking a cigarette,
     George takes the failure on the chin.
                                                               22.


     One couple gets to their feet and leaves the theater. As the
     man reaches George, he recognizes him and casts him a glance
     that seems to say "goodness old chap this one's not up to
     much..." George doesn't know what to say in reply.


60   EXT. MOVIE THEATERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                       60

     Outside, George comes out still smoking his cigarette. On the
     sidewalk, people are cheerfully waiting in line. George walks
     up the line and comes to a movie house that's playing the
     "Beauty Spot" talking movie. A huge poster depicts Peppy and
     the people in the line seem excited and delighted to be going
     to see the film. It's visibly a success. George takes it on the
     chin.


61   INT. GEORGE'S CAR (DRIVING) - LOS ANGELES STREETS - DAY       61

     Inside the car, behind the implacable chauffeur, George is
     talking to himself, as though he's re-running the story in
     his head and searching for what he might have done better, or
     differently.


62   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - DAY                              62

     Once home, he finds a photo of himself on the floor. It has
     been defaced with a scribbled moustache, spectacles and a big
     nose. There's a note to him scribbled on the back. We read it
     at the same time as him.

     It's over, George. You've got a fortnight to collect your
     souvenirs together and get out of the house.

     Doris
     P.S.: You should go see Beauty Spot, it's incredible.

     George takes it on the chin and leaves, revealing behind him
     the portrait of himself wearing a tuxedo, smiling and waving.


63   INT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" SCREENING - DAY          63

     As for Peppy, she's in the theater, watching Tears of love.
     She's with a handsome young man who seems bored.


64   EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                             64

     George is wearing shorts and an explorer's hat. He is sinking
     in sinking sand. The young woman is screaming and the dog
     barking.
                                                                23.


     The Africans are panicking but there's nothing anyone can do.
     George stops struggling, and looks deep into the eyes of the
     young woman. He says gently:

     Title card: Farewell, Norma.    I never loved you...

     It's obvious he's only saying that so that she can forget him
     and move on with her life, but it doesn't wash and the young
     woman weeps all the more, terribly moved by this last
     sacrifice on his part.

     (63) In the balcony, Peppy is speechless and her face
     impassive.

     (64) On screen, George and the young women exchange a last
     glance as George's face gradually sinks into the sand.

     (63) Next to Peppy, the young man sits watching her. She sees
     sad.

     (64) On screen, George has disappeared into the mire. Only
     one hand stays in the air for several seconds more in a
     tortured pose, that of a dying man trying to hold on to the
     wind.

     (63) Peppy's companion seems to find the film far too long
     and doesn't understand why they haven't already left.

     (64) The hand has disappeared. The young woman is in a state
     of shock, rigid with a look of horror on her face. She is no
     doubt about to be put to certain death. The dog turns round
     and walks off with head and tail lowered...

     The End appears on the screen.

     (63) Peppy seems moved. She is shaking her head from side to
     side.


65   EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - PICTURE OF GEORGE - EVENING        65

     Evening has fallen on the town. It's raining. On the ground
     lies an old page from a newspaper that bears a picture of
     George. A man's feet trample the picture.


66   INT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - NIGHT                           66

     George is   at home. Two bottles are apparent and, obviously
     drunk, he   is staring out the window. The projection of
     raindrops   sliding down the window look like tears running down
     his face.   And Jack's face too. George is pulled out of his
     stupor as   he hears something.
                                                              24.


67   EXT. GEORGE & DORIS' HOUSE - TOP STEP - NIGHT                 67

     He opens the door. It's Peppy. She immediately notices that
     George is drunk. Her smile tenses a little.

     Title card: I wanted to talk, I...

     George looks at her. She continues.

     Title card: I saw Tears of Love.

     George nods, and answers.

     Title card: And so you've come to get your money back?

     She smiles stiffly, not knowing how to react.   He continues.

     Title card: Too much face-pulling?

     She stops smiling because it's not funny at all. It's bitter,
     even. There's an embarrassed silence. Softly, she tries to
     explain.

     Title card: About last night...

     She stops because George is not looking at her anymore. He's
     watching the arrival of the young, smiling, handsome and
     wholesome man who is with Peppy. George bears a melancholy
     smile.

     Title card: You're right. Make way for youth...

     The young man shakes George's hand. He's obviously a nice
     lad, and very polite.

     Title card: I'm so happy to meet you. My Dad just loves you.

     He says it very nicely, with no ulterior motive, but George
     is cut to the quick. The comment wounds him and Peppy
     notices. She cuts short the meeting by smiling and upping the
     cheerfulness stakes, as though to kid George she hasn't
     noticed any embarrassment or perceived anything that might
     have shocked or hurt him during their encounter.

     Title card: OK! Well, we'll be off now.   I'll call you soon.
     Bye!

     George smiles politely. She leaves, taking the handsome jock
     with her. George watches them leave. As does his dog, who
     sits with his head and ears hanging low as though very
     disappointed. George watches Peppy walking away, then steps
     forwards and sits down on the steps leading up to the house.
                                                              25.


     As she gets into the car, Peppy seems surly, unhappy even,
     for the first time. She turns her back on her companion.

     Title card: Take me home. I'd like to be alone.

     George watches the car leave, then goes and sits on a bench
     next to the front door. But the bench breaks and George finds
     himself on the ground next to the dog. George remarks evenly
     to Jack:

     Title card: See, could be it just wasn't my day...

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.


68   EXT. MOVIE THEATER - "TEARS OF LOVE" - DAY                    68

     In the rain, a worker is taking down letters from the facade
     of a theater. Of Tears of Love, only the word Tears remains.


69   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          69

     Peppy is facing her mirror and putting her make up on. She
     takes a break, looking a little sad. Someone (some kind of
     assistant) opens the door to her dressing room and says
     something like you need to hurry up. She nods and gets back
     to work.


70   EXT. MOVIE POSTERS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                        70

     Alternate shots of three or four film posters and frames from
     them which illustrate Peppy's rising fame. Her name moves
     higher up the posters and into bigger letters. The films are
     called "The Rookie", "The Brunette ", "The Girl Next Door" and,
     finally, "On the Roof ".


71                                                                 71
     OMITTED


72   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY          72

     We catch up with her in a close up, applying her make up. The
     camera pulls back and we see that not only is she not putting
     the make up on herself - a make up artist is doing that - but
     there are in fact four pairs of hands getting busy around her;
     two make up girls, a hairdresser and a wardrobe assistant.
     Peppy, fortunately, has stayed completely natural and doesn't
     seem to take any of it seriously. As the last touch is put in
     place, Peppy gets to her feet and turns round.
                                                              26.


     At her feet lie a dozen pairs of shoes, each pair as
     magnificent as the next, and all in their swanky boxes. Peppy
     tries on a pair. Close up of her feet.


73   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE (1931) - DAY                              73

     Crossfade to a man's pair of shoes with used heels and uppers.
     George's dog comes to sit at his feet. The date is superimposed
     on the screen: 1931.

     The camera climbs up his legs to reveal George lying fully
     dressed in his bed, obviously at home in view of his attitude.
     He's changed. And even if his suit is still pretty smart, he's
     become more "common", less unattainable. He seems to have lost
     whatever it was that made him so superb. Primarily he's a bit
     drunk, somewhat hesitant. George gets up and closes his Murphy
     bed, the kind of bed that slots up into the wall to look like a
     closet. Then he walks across the living area. His home has
     changed too, it's fallen in class and is a lot more modest than
     the one we were used to seeing him in. We do however recognize
     some of the objects, furniture and paintings from his old
     house, notably the huge portrait of him smiling. He goes into
     the kitchen which is open onto the rest of the apartment.
     There's nothing in the refrigerator. He looks for something to
     drink but there's only one bottle left in the rack. He lifts it
     up. It's empty.

     He opens a closet. Inside, a tuxedo hangs among a number of
     bare hangers.


74   INT. PAWNSHOP - DAY                                           74

     In a pawnshop, George, still a little drunk, is selling his
     tuxedo. The pawnbroker and he are visibly disagreeing on the
     price, but of course it's George who folds first and hands
     over the tuxedo. The pawnbroker counts out the bills and
     hands them to George who, in a fit of pride, leaves a tip as
     he leaves - his dignity intact even in the face of adversity.


75   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     75

     At home, George is drinking and watching his chauffeur fix some
     food. He seems preoccupied.

     Title card: How long's it been since I paid you last,
     Clifton?

     The chauffeur answers as he carries on doing what he's doing.

     Title card: Been one year now, Sir.
                                                              27.


     George gets up, visibly thinking that he shouldn't have done
     that, that it's wrong. He go gets the keys and a jacket,
     comes back and gives them to the chauffeur.

     Title card: You're fired. Keep the car. Get yourself a job
     someplace else.

     The chauffeur refuses, George insists. They don't agree but
     George ends up throwing him out, even though we've understood
     that he's doing it for Clifton's benefit and not through any
     unkindness.


76   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     76

     Once outside, the chauffeur doesn't move. He stays next to the
     car. George watches him through the window. The chauffeur
     still doesn't budge. George pulls the curtains.


77   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - EVENING                                 77

     In the evening, George looks out between the curtains, the
     chauffeur is still there. George turns on his heels and gets
     into his Murphy bed.


78   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         78

     Night time. George is in bed with his eyes open.


79   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   79

     Outside, the chauffeur is still in the same position.


80   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                     80

     The next morning, George gets up and goes to look from the
     window. The chauffeur has gone. George is a little sad, but
     that's just the way it is... He looks around at his home.

     A little later, George looks at himself in a mirror. We pass
     from him to his reflection, which he hides by placing his drink
     against the mirror.


81   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - DAY                                      81

     A sign says that the effects of George Valentin are to be
     auctioned. Furniture, costumes, objets d'art and paintings on
     September 14th. There aren't many people in the room, just five
     or six. George is standing at the back, smoking a cigarette.
                                                              28.


     His position and demeanor are exactly like when he was watching
     the screening of Tears of Love, from the back of the room with
     the verdict of failure in the air...

     He's looking a little unsteady on his feet, probably due to the
     hip flask he's necking that seems to contain liquor. The
     objects go under the hammer one by one. We see the three
     monkeys go by, notably, hear no evil, speak no evil, see no
     evil. Two buyers especially are raising the prices by bidding
     against each other, a distinguished and reserved-looking man,
     and a lady of a certain age who looks a bit severe, to the
     point of bigotry. They don't seem perfectly comfortable, but
     they are the only two buying.

     A few crossfades (the display table emptying, faces, hands
     being raised, hammer falling, "sold" labels) show us the lots
     disappearing - every single item is sold.


82   INT. AUCTION ROOMS - CORRIDOR - DAY                           82

     George is now with the auctioneer, he's studying the list of
     items as auction assistants busy themselves around him,
     carrying and packing the sold lots. The auctioneer, who is
     putting on his coat, congratulates George.

     Title card: Well done! It all sold, there's nothing left!

     George nods but his smile seems a little ironic. He leaves
     the room.

     On the stairway, as he's leaving, he is joined by the
     distinguished-looking man who puts on his coat and leaves.


83   EXT. AUCTION ROOM'S STREET - DAY                              83

     They leave at the same time. The man crosses the street, we
     follow him.

     He gets into a car. Peppy is sitting in the back. She's alone
     and watching George walk off with his unsteady gait. She's sad.
     The man casts a glance to ask her what he should do next.
     Peppy, with a forced smile, motions that they can leave. As the
     man starts up the motorcar, George is walking away. The car
     sets off and overtakes him. Peppy does not turn round. She's
     crying.


84   INT. CLANDESTINE BAR - NIGHT                                  84

     George, dressed differently, is drinking in a clandestine bar
     that has made the effort of putting up a few Christmas
     decorations. George is visibly smashed.
                                                              29.


85   INT. STUDIO JUNGLE ENCRUSTED LITTLE GEORGE - NIGHT            85

     A small version of him appears superimposed on the bar, dressed
     as an explorer and discovering the life-size version of
     himself. The big version watches the little version load his
     rifle. Then the little version shoots at the big version, but
     the big version just smiles.

     Little version runs off shot to get help, and he comes back
     with a tribe of African warriors, all bearing spears. They
     attack.

     Big version tries to defend himself, staggers as he gets to his
     feet, tries to gesture to the barman, but he is so drunk that
     he falls straight backwards without making the slightest
     attempt to stop his fall. The Africans leap about with joy.

                                                  FADE TO BLACK.

     (84) George's chauffeur comes into the bar. He motions to the
     barman who jerks his head in one direction. The chauffeur
     follows the indication and finds George lying on the floor,
     totally smashed. He slaps him gently around the face a few
     times in a vain attempt to wake him, then lifts him over his
     shoulder, pays the check and leaves.


86   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   86

     At George's house, his chauffeur puts him to bed and hangs his
     suit carefully before leaving the room. He sees the dog, goes
     over to it and strokes it. They look at each other. We can tell
     that the chauffeur is worried about George.


87   EXT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - DAY                           87

     Peppy Miller is "The Guardian Angel". It's a huge poster on the
     façade of a movie theater. George goes inside. With Jack.


88   INT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - DAY                           88

     The auditorium is full. George sits down in the first row. To
     watch the film he has to look upwards, and sees a huge and
     magnificent Peppy rising above him. She's playing a scene with
     a young actor we recognize, it's Humphrey Bogart. He's become a
     spectator: he laughs, is absorbed and cries along with the
     others.
                                                               30.


89   INT. "GUARDIAN ANGEL" THEATER - CORRIDOR & LOBBY - DAY       89

     Coming out of the theater several young people bump into him.
     They don't recognize him. There's a lot of people milling
     about, so he picks Jack up. A woman exclaims an Oh! of
     admiration as though she's recognized George. He smiles
     modestly but soon realizes that it's just because she thinks
     Jack is cute and has come over to stroke him like she would any
     other dog. She is totally under Jack's charm, and says to
     George.

     Title card: If only he could talk!

     George still has the smile on his lips, but it has become one
     of resignation.

     He looks away as the woman strokes the dog.


90   EXT. MEXICAN VILLAGE - DAY                                   90

     George is playing Zorro. He performs stunt after stunt and the
     close ups show his devastating smile to its best advantage. In
     fact, it's an extract from The Mark of Zorro with Douglas
     Fairbanks, into which we'll insert close ups of Jean we've shot
     ourselves.


91   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    91

     The Zorro sequence is being screened on a wall in George's
     apartment. George is watching himself, slumped in an easy
     chair. His sluggish attitude and listless air are in sharp
     contrast with the image of himself projected by the film.

     Then the image jumps and goes white. George gets up, still half-
     smashed. His shadow is clearly delineated on the white screen.
     He sees it, looks it up and down and then starts to look at it
     sideways.

     Title card: Look what you've become...

     He carries on shouting at it, obviously very annoyed with it.

     Title card: You were very nasty! And stupid! And arrogant!

     He doesn't even want to look at it anymore. He looks
     disgusted. Suddenly his shadow separates itself from him and
     moves independently from him. As he shouts at it, it lowers
     its head and doesn't reply.

     Title card: You acted very badly! You were thoughtless!
                                                               31.


     He carries on as though it's normal until his shadow walks
     off with its head bowed. He watches it go, trying to
     understand what's happening, but it's gone and he's still
     there. He begins to holler.

     Title card: COME BACK! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!!

     Totally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels
     against the wall as he hollers. The cans split open and the
     film bursts out all over. George is becoming more and more
     frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He
     stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a
     moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider
     what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of
     the reels.

     There's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold.
     We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's
     very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an
     instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and
     barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He
     doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is
     spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where
     the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins
     throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's
     looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness
     of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible.
     On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs
     off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with
     the cans of reels.


92   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    92

     The dog comes out of the house and makes a dash for the
     sidewalk as fast as he can.

     (91) In the room, among the flames and the smoke, George -
     now breathless - picks one of the reels and tries to turn
     round. He collapses, still holding on to the can.


93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93

     Jack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's
     trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards
     George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and
     pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but
     the cop just wants to be left in peace.

     (91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke
     is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face.
                                                              32.


     (93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels
     uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively.
     Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be
     silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George
     miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has
     no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog
     to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but
     stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with
     him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who
     tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a
     moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack
     encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin
     with. Little by little though, as though realizing the
     seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more,


94   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    94

     until he finally arrives flat out at George's home. The cop
     sees the smoke coming out of the house. He runs into the smoke.


95   INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    95

     A completely unconscious George, overcome by the fumes, is
     dragged out of the fire by the policeman.


96   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    96

     They come out the house. George is still clutching the reel. A
     crowd has formed, people recognize him. One woman feels sorry
     for him, a man runs for help. George is unconscious.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.


97   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY              97

     We see Peppy on a shoot, sitting in a chair with her name on
     it, smoking a cigarette. Everyone about her is busy preparing a
     shot. Suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone. She takes
     the receiver with a smile and listens. Her expression tightens
     a little. She hangs up, pensive for a moment. On set,the
     director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and
     they are good to go. The assistant goes towards Peppy to let
     her know but, as he gets to where she should be, her seat is
     empty. He looks everywhere for her, but she has disappeared.


98   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             98

     In her car, and still in costume, she urges her chauffeur to go
     quick as he can.
                                                                 33.


99    EXT. HOSPITAL COURTYARD - DAY                                99

      The car pulls into the hospital courtyard.


100   INT. HOSPITAL - LOBBY AND STAIRS - DAY                      100

      Peppy bursts into the lobby, talks to a woman at the desk who
      directs her with a raised hand that Peppy immediately follows.

      She bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a
      corridor,


101   INT. HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR AND GEORGE'S ROOM - DAY            101

      and then to a door through the window of which she sees
      George lying down. His dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep.
      George is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. A
      doctor is in the room with a nurse.

      Peppy enters. She's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring.

      Title card: He's not in any danger now. He just needs to
      rest.

      Peppy goes up to George. She notices that his burnt hands
      seem to still be clutching something. She's intrigued. In
      response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in
      a corner of the room.

      Title card: He was holding that. It was real hard to pry it
      away from him.

      Peppy picks up the can. The label is too damaged to be able
      to read the title of the film. She opens it and unrolls some
      of the film in front of the window. We see random photograms
      run by. It's the only sequence they ever shot together, years
      before. Peppy is moved. Without turning round, she asks the
      doctor:

      Title card: Do you think he could come rest up at my place?

      The doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye.

      Title card: It's probably the very best he could have hoped
      for.


102   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    102

      An ambulance takes George, still unconscious, to Peppy's
      house. Jack is with him.
                                                                 34.


      It's a large, beautiful house, very expensive and very
      Hollywood. But it's also very inviting.


103   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM & CORRIDOR - NIGHT    103

      It's night time. George is in bed. He opens one eye. Then he
      wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is.

      Jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. A nurse who had been
      dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then
      goes over to George. She reassures him, motions to him not to
      get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down
      the corridor. She knocks at a door then goes back to George's
      room. Peppy is close on her heels. She comes into the room in
      her nightgown. When he sees her, George smiles and she rushes
      over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. She is
      terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk
      to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and
      so was not sharing the same special moment as she. She pulls a
      face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over
      at the nurse, then lays George's head back on his pillow.


104   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                 104

      The next morning, Peppy brings breakfast into George's room
      and they eat it together. She laughs, talks, eats, drinks and
      is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years
      before. He looks at her with a smile on his face. Then she
      looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry.

      Title card: I've got to go. I have to be on set for nine
      o'clock.

      George smiles kindly at her. She returns the smile but we can
      tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is
      working, and he is not. They exchange a last glance before
      she leaves the room.

      George, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. He picks up
      a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. It's his jacket
      and pants, both half burned. On the floor, his shoes are in
      exactly the same state of disrepair.


105   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    105

      A little later, and alone, he's exploring the house. It's
      richly and tastefully decorated, highly personal. He goes
      along a corridor and down a wide stairway. Jack begins sniffing
      outside of one door, as though he wants to go inside.
                                                               35.


106   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                        106

      George opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of
      storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. He
      closes the door behind him. The room has a ghostly quality to
      it. Jack sniffs about everywhere. George too seems troubled by
      the strange pervading atmosphere. His curiosity is spurred by
      a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. A ray of
      light surges into the room. The door has opened and, standing
      against the daylight, is a maid.

      Title card: You should go back to your room, Sir.

      George nods with a smile. The maid leaves pretty swiftly, we
      haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange.
      George is intrigued but leaves the room. He has to call Jack
      to him. Jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.


107   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS - PEPPY SET - 1931 - DAY             107

      A screenplay lies on a table. Peppy and Zimmer are seated
      either side of the table and are talking animatedly. We're on
      the set we saw the previous day, and Peppy seems to be trying
      to convince Zimmer of something. She seems to be describing a
      film poster or the façade of a movie theater she'd love to see.
      He doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative
      shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to
      Peppy. She finally stops talking and gives him a determined
      look. Zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies.

      Title card: George is a silent movie actor. He belongs to the
      past. Today he's a nobody.

      As Zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat.
      Zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking.

      Title card: What are you doing?

      She looks him straight in the eyes, and answers:

      Title card: I'm stopping work. It's him or me.

      She looks determined. He's looking unsure of himself. He
      visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. She drives her
      point home.

      Title card: What I mean is it's either him AND me! Or neither
      of us!

      Zimmer still isn't sure he's understood. He just looks at
      her.

      Title card: I'm blackmailing you, get it?!
                                                                36.


      Even when she's blackmailing, she's still pretty, and Zimmer
      looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time it's
      obvious that he's going to back down. The people around them
      are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting
      for his decision. There's an element of déjà-vu to the
      situation, and Zimmer, who already backed down a few years
      before, gives in.

      Title card: And why not...

      She smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and
      leaves. As he moves away she whistles at him. He turns round
      and she vigorously blows him a kiss.


108   INT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                             108

      The screenplay lies on the front seat of a car. The camera
      pulls back, it's Clifton who is in the driving seat.


109   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY                  109

      George is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in. At
      first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into
      astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. The
      chauffeur answers:

      Title card: I work for Miss Miller now.

      George visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he
      remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. It's as though
      something has come between them. The chauffeur places the
      screenplay on the bedside table. George seems to greet it
      with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm.

      The chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts
      on a plate for George. George doesn't want any, it's all too
      much...

      Before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual
      reserve for the first time and says to George:

      Title card: She's been good to you. She's always looked out
      for you.

      The chauffeur leaves without trying to convince George
      further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.
                                                               37.


110   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  110

      From the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and
      drive off. We recognize the car as being the one that belonged
      to George.

      (109) At the window, George watches him leave. Then he seems
      to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.


111   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      111

      George goes into the room that's full of sheets. He goes
      straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up
      the sheet. Underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the
      three monkeys "hear no evil", "speak no evil" and "see no
      evil". He thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to
      reveal a piece of furniture. Once again it's a piece that used
      to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the
      auction room.

      After taking off several other sheets, George realizes that
      she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture,
      paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. He rips off sheets
      one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his
      suits and tuxedos. He continues and discovers the painting
      depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. George looks
      stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. He's
      interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room
      once more. This time, at the door, are the butler and the maid.

      George walks towards them when he sees them. The closer he gets
      to them, however, the more his expression tightens. We realize
      that the butler is none other than the distinguished-looking
      man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid
      is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale
      prices. George is looking at them as he leaves the room. He has
      recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. He walks
      off, still shocked by what he's just realized.


112   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - GEORGE'S BEDROOM - DAY               112

      He finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room, and leaves.


113   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  113

      He goes down the stairs and flees the house.
                                                               38.


114   EXT. BEGGAR STREET - DAY                                  114

      George is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged
      shoes. He is shirtless. With Jack by his side, he walks along
      the sidewalk. There are a few other people walking along. About
      twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. He holds out his
      hand to passers-by. George approaches and, when there are no
      other passers-by between him and George, the beggar glances at
      him and lowers his hand. He doesn't raise it as George
      approaches. George stops in front of him and looks at him, but
      the beggar motions to him to scram. George continues on his
      way. For that moment at least, he has become one of them.

      He buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the
      fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses
      himself in the crowd. Some distance later, he stops to check
      his reflection in a shop window. The image he sees is that of a
      bum. It's even more striking because the in the window there is
      a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf.
      The image of the mannequin and that of George are superimposed.

      A cop comes up to George and begins talking to him in a
      friendly manner. He speaks but we don't know what about. There
      is not Title card. George visibly has no idea what the cop is
      talking about. The cop seems to be talking about nothing
      important, just chatting... He talks and talks... George
      doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand
      why he's talking to him. He's lost.

      Title card: What did you say?

      The cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. He thinks
      he's talking to a madman. He doesn't persist, merely sizes
      George up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop
      walks off. George, totally bewildered by the incident, seems
      to lose his grip on himself a little more.


115   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  115

      Peppy gets home in the evening, arms laden with flowers. She's
      happy.

      She quickly goes up the stairs and into George's bedroom. He's
      not there. She looks for him but can't find him. The maid says
      that he has left. She drops the flowers.


116   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           116

      George goes into his house that has been disfigured by the
      fire. The flames have changed everything and the atmosphere,
      here again, seems ghostly and sad.
                                                               39.


      George sits down in an armchair in the darkness. Jack sits down
      facing him. He wags his tail and it thumps on the ground.


117   INT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - STOREROOM - DAY                      117

      In the room with all the sheets, Peppy is with the maid. The
      maid seems to be telling her what happened with George, how he
      removed all the sheets, etc. Peppy listens with an inscrutable
      expression on her face. Then, suddenly overcome by a terrible
      thought, she rushes outside.


118   EXT. PEPPY'S HOUSE - DAY                                  118

      She runs out of the house and over to the car, but the
      chauffeur isn't there. She honks the horn to call him but
      there's no response. She honks the horn again, then, not
      wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the
      dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and
      pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. It's obvious that she
      doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full
      speed - more or less successfully. Just as she passes through
      the gate, the chauffeur turns up. Too late. He sees her drive
      away.


119   EXT. PEPPY'S CAR (DRIVING) - DAY                          119

      Peppy is driving as fast as she can through town, but she's
      pretty reckless and almost causes an accident.


120   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                           120

      Outside George's house, the wind is slamming one of the
      shutters with the regularity of a metronome. George takes a
      gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box
      and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of
      him. He picks up the glass for another gulp. Jack doesn't like
      what he sees. He barks.

      (119) As for Peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring
      even the most basic of road safety requirements.

      (120) George puts down his glass and picks up the pistol.
      Jack isn't happy at all. He barks and bites George's trouser
      leg, pulling on it.

      (119) Peppy speeding along.

      (120) George puts the pistol into his mouth. Jack is barking
      like mad. George, still in the same position, closes his
      eyes.
                                                                40.


      Title card: "BANG!"

      George is in the same position. He still has the pistol in
      his mouth. Visibly, he's heard a BANG from outside, because
      he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the
      window.


121   EXT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            121

      Outside, we see Peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is
      still shuddering. Peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't
      care. She jumps out the car and runs into the house.


122   INT. GEORGE'S BURNT HOUSE - DAY                            122

      She rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look
      at George. George awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind
      him. She bursts into tears.

      Title card: I feel so awful. I only wanted to help you. To
      take care of you...

      He seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got
      nothing to feel bad about. He opens his arms towards her,
      still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself.
      Fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes Peppy
      laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws
      herself into George's arms. They hug for a long time. Peppy
      says into his ear,

      Title card: You've got so much that no one else has...

      And into her ear, George replies:

      Title card: No, I'm nothing but a shadow. No good for
      anything but silence.

      Peppy doesn't reply. She just holds him tighter still and
      closes her eyes. Jack is sitting close by, watching them and
      wagging his tail.

      Outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still
      shuddering. Peppy opens her eyes. Visibly, she's had an idea.

      Jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. The shutter
      slams. The car shudders. Peppy smiles at George.

      Title card: I know what you have that no one else does.

      Peppy moves away from George and motions to him to listen.
      The shutter slams. Jacks tail thumps. The car shudders... Peppy
      does a few tap steps. George doesn't understand.
                                                               41.


      Peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his
      response. George does a few tap steps himself, basic ones,
      without any great enthusiasm. She smiles at him and does a
      few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. He smiles
      back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his
      feet. He looks at Peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his
      face.


123   INT. KINOGRAPH STUDIOS (1931) - ZIMMER'S OFFICE - DAY     123

      Music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in
      another decor. Except that from now on we actually hear the
      sound of the tap steps. We pull back to find Peppy and George
      in Zimmer's office. They're dancing for him. Little by little,
      Zimmer is convinced by them, and, when they finish their
      demonstration, he has a broad smile on his face.


124   INT. STUDIO - PEPPY & GEORGE - DAY                        124

      We find Peppy and George on a film set, still dancing. The
      piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now
      everyone wants to get up and dance! They are dancing a tap
      number facing the camera, in a décor representing a stylized
      New York. The choreography is incredible, in the grand style
      of the old Hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee
      slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on
      their faces. The music stops on a powerful blast from the
      brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy.
      In the ensuing silence, Peppy and George stay exactly where
      they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their
      faces. It goes on for a little too long, they are out of
      breath.

      Then they look at someone off-shot. They are facing a film
      crew (from their era of course). The director smiles. Zimmer,
      sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. The director speaks and
      we hear what he says.

                          DIRECTOR
                Cut! Excellent!

      Zimmer has both his thumbs up. The director says to Peppy and
      George.

                          DIRECTOR (CONT'D)
                Once more? Please?

      George laughs and replies, and we hear him too.

                          GEORGE
                With pleasure!
                                                       42.


                           THE End

The credits run while Peppy and George go back to their
positions. The camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come
all the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair,
make-up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming
into position, the director coming over to say a few words to
the star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for
another take. And, when everyone is in position, the director
speaks into his megaphone and we hear "OK, Camera! Sound!
Rolling... and... Action!"

Fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the
credit sequence.

	AS GOOD AS IT GETSAS GOOD AS IT GETS


	by 

	Mard Andrus 

	And 

	James L. Brooks 

	Story by 

	Mark Andrus





	FADE IN:

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an 
	enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up 
	against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the 
	unseen love of her long life.

			SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I'm just going to get some 
		flowers, dear. I'll be back in 
		twenty minutes. It's tulip season 
		today. I'm so happy.

	And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness 
	dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that 
	quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her 
	apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

	POV - MELVIN UDALL

	in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, 
	unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever 
	met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength 
	is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the 
	elevator door he holds open.

			MELVIN
		Come here, sweetheart... come on.

	ON DOG

	Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. 
	Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the 
	mutt who has ignores him.

			MELVIN
		Wanna go for a ride? Okay, 
		sweetie?

	The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges 
	and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog 
	urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG 
	sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

			MELVIN
			(a malevolent tone)
		You've pissed your last floor, you 
		dog-eared monkey.

	The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much 
	meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout 
	shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the 
	garbage chute.
				
			MELVIN
		I'll bet you wish you were some 
		sort of real dog now, huh? Don't 
		worry...  this is New York. If you 
		can make it here, you can make it 
		anywhere, you know? You ugly, 
		smelly fuck.

	And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and 
	lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS" 
	from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment 
	door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON 
	NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with 
	Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of 
	trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about 
	to enter his apartment.

			SIMON
		Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie... 

	He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
			
			SIMON
		Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey 
		there!
			(as Melvin turns)
		Have you seen Verdell?

			MELVIN
		What's he look like?

	Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is 
	directly opposite Simon's.

			SIMON
		My dog... you know... I mean my 
		little dog with the adorable 
		face... Don't you know what my dog 
		looks like?

			MELVIN
		I got it. You're talking about 
		your dog. I thought that was the 
		name of the colored man I've been 
		seeing in the hall.

	Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

			SIMON
		Which color was that?

			MELVIN
		Like thick molasses, with one of 
		those wide noses perfect for 
		smelling trouble and prison 
		food... 

	Simon has had it.

			SIMON
		Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

			MELVIN
			(not missing a beat)
		How're you doing?

				SIMON
		Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I 
		think you know that.

				FRANK
			(overlapping)
		Simon, you've got to get dressed.

				MELVIN
			(to Simon)
		What I know is that as long as you 
		keep your work zipped up around 
		me, I don't give a fuck what or 
		where you shove your show. Are we 
		being neighbors for now?

				SIMON
			(to Frank)
		Do you still think I was 
		exaggerating?

	FRANK can only smile.

				FRANK
		Definitely a package you don't 
		want to open or touch.

				MELVIN
		Hope you find him. I love that 
		dog.

	Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds 
	himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

				SIMON
			(directly)
		You don't love anything, Mr. 
		Udall.

	Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the 
	hallway.

				MELVIN
		I love throwing your dog down the 
		garbage chute.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to 
	five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and 
	off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards 
	his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens 
	the medicine chest.

	INT. MEDICINE CHEST

	Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps 
	one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the 
	process two more times.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

	A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN 
	holding Verdell who looks and finds:

	SIMON

	who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves 
	quickly toward the group and his dog.

				SIMON
		Thank the good Lord... wow... my 
		honey... where have you been?

				PARTY GOER
			(thinking the greeting's 
			for him)
		He always liked me.

	As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the 
	Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a 
	laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As 
	the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. 
	Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks 
	some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts 
	Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS 
	in protest.

				SIMON
		Just for a second, okay?

	The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

				SIMON
			(kissing him on the mouth)
		Look at him...  where was little 
		baby?

				HANDYMAN
			(smiling)
		In the basement garbage bin eating 
		diaper shit.

	Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in 
	cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

				SIMON
		Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.
			(looking at Verdell)
		How did he get down in the 
		basement? I mean even if he got 
		on the elevator how... ?

				HANDYMAN
		Maybe some nice neighbor shoved 
		him down the garbage chute.

				SIMON
		My God! No!

	He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

	Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he 
	writes.

				MELVIN
		'Somewhat in the dark, she had 
		confessed and he had forgiven. 
		This is what you live for, he 
		said. Two heads on a pillow where 
		there is only the safety of being 
		with each other. How, she 
		wondered, could she find such hope 
		in the most shameful part of her.'

	He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall.

	But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

				MELVIN
		'At last she was able to define 
		love. Love was... '

	More KNOCKING.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you 
		please.

				MELVIN
		'Love was... '

	He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of 
	love -- but the knocking throws him.

				MELVIN
		... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
		stool-pusher.

	He burst from his chair.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step 
	back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

				MELVIN
			(loud and angry)
		Yeeeess!!!

				SIMON
		Maybe this can wait.

	Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

				SIMON
		I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

				MELVIN
		Well, that's a load off.

	Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to 
	close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

				SIMON
		Did you... do something to him?

				MELVIN
		Do you realize that I work at 
		him?

				SIMON
			(eyes downcast)
		No, I didn't.

				MELVIN
		Do you like to be interrupt when 
		you are danging around in your 
		little garden?

				SIMON
		No...  actually, I even shut the 
		phone off and put a little piece 
		of cardboard in the ringer so no 
		one can just buzz me from d... 

				MELVIN
		Well, I work all the time. So 
		never, never again interrupt me. 
		Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 
		years from now... not if there's 
		fire. Not even if you hear a thud 
		from inside my home and a week 
		later there's a smell from in 
		there that can only come from a 
		decaying body and you have to hold 
		a hanky against your face because 
		the stench is so thick you think 
		you're going to faint even then 
		don't come knocking or, if it's 
		election night and you're excited 
		and want to celebrate because some 
		fudge-packer you dated has been 
		elected the first queer President 
		of the United States... and he's 
		going to put you up in Camp David 
		and you just want to share the 
		moment with someone...  don't knock
		...  not on this door. Not for 
		anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

				SIMON
		Yes. It's not a subtle point 
		you're making.

				MELVIN
		Okay, then.

	Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

				SIMON
		So the theory of confrontations is 
		that now he'll think twice before 
		messing with me?

	Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

				SIMON
		He's genuinely upsetting, isn't 
		he?

				FRANK
		Won't worry about it. You go 
		ahead.

	Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly 
	on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really 
		pissed!!!

	Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. 
	Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him 
	forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

				MELVIN
		No touch. No touch. No touch.

				FRANK
		You may think you can intimidate 
		the whole world with your 
		attitude, but I grew up in Hell. 
		My grandmother had more attitude. 
		You don't intimidate me.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Police! Police! Fucking crooked 
		police...  doughnut-munching morons 
		help me!
			(to Frank)
		Assault and battery and you're 
		black.

				FRANK
		Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like 
		him enough to batter you 
		unrecognizable if you verbally 
		abuse him or so much as touch his 
		dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try 
		and think how you can make this up 
		to him.
			(suddenly loud)
		I hate doing this. I'm an art 
		dealer.
			(beat)
		Have a nice day. Party!

	He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens 
	his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as 
	he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears 
	impressed.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His 
	walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the 
	danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. 
	At times he places his palms together and extends his 
	arms cutting a path through people. We will be very 
	pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	His eyes focused on the terrain.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	ANGLE ON WAITRESS

	CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. 
	You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be 
	the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a 
	story about her son for the umpteenth time.

				CAROL
			(to the Mother's 
			little girl)
		Look at you, you're all better.

				MOTHER
		It's that new medication.

				CAROL
		You know all my son's stuff, 
		right?

	The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but 
	Carol interrupts her.

				CAROL
		No, no, no, I got a date tonight. 
		I'm walking out the door this 
		morning and he says to me, 'Mom, 
		I promise not to get one of my 
		fevers or coughs during your 
		date.'

				MOTHER
		Isn't that sweet.

				CAROL
		Little blonde angle.
			(to child, 
			affectionately)
		Eat everything.

	Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a 
	table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find 
	a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

				WOMAN
		It just came out of me. I said 
		you love me the way a remote 
		control loves a TV. As long as I 
		switch every time... 

				HER MALE COMPANION
		Wonderful.

				MELVIN
		People who talk in metaphors can 
		shampoo my crotch.
			(on their look)
		Eat up.

	They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the 
	waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, 
	are talking.

				LISA
		Pay me back next week.

				CAROL
		I owe you. I told you today... 
		them's the rules. Oh, excuse me, 
		Melvin.

	She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out 
	of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else 
	ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

				MELVIN
		I'm starving.

				CAROL
			(firmly to Lisa)
		Will you please take it?

	Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with 
	stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out 
	of the way... 

				LISA
		This way you take a cab home so 
		you have time to get ready for the 
		date.

				CAROL
		"Ready" is not my problem.

	She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could 
	read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the 
	date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

				CAROL
			(to Melvin)
		Go sit down. You know you're not 
		allowed back here...  Spencer's 
		more excited about it than I am... 
		He says, "Mom, I promise not to 
		get a fever or couch during your date."

	The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go 
	"awww."

				CAROL
		I know. He's just the best.

				MELVIN
		I've got Jews at my table.

				CAROL
		It's not your table. It's the 
		place's table. Behave. This 
		once, you can sit at someone 
		else's station.

	The two waitresses signal their protests.

				CAROL
		Or you can just wait your turn... 

	Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs 
	near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo... 
	then:

				MELVIN
		How much more you got to eat? 
		Your appetite isn't as big as 
		your noses, is it?

				WOMAN
		What?!!

				MAN
			(to Woman)
		Let's go --

	The Woman starts to protest.

				MAN
		Let's leave. We're going.

	Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his 
	pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. 
	As he opens his utensils.

				CAROL
		Bryan says he doesn't care how 
		long you've been coming you ever 
		act like this again you're barred 
		for life. I'm gonna miss the 
		excitement, but I'll handle it.

	There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some 
	ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only 
	one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear 
	the table.

				MELVIN
		The table's fine if it had some 
		cholesterol on it. Two sausages, 
		six bacon strips, fries, three 
		eggs over easy and coffee.

				CAROL
		You're gonna die soon with that 
		diet, you know that?

				MELVIN
		We're all gonna die soon. I will. 
		You will. It sure sounds like 
		your son will.

	ON CAROL

	Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her 
	perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin 
	senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

				CAROL
		If you ever mention my son again, 
		you will never be able to eat here 
		again. Do you understand? Give me 
		some sign you understand or leave 
		now. Do you understand me... 
			(adds truthful label)
		you crazy freak? Do you?!?

	A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing 
	down.

				CAROL
		Okay. I'll get your order.

	She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower 
	lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room 
	sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make 
	noises as she responds...  each time startling herself 
	with her own noise and trying to reign it in.

	She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway 
	-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the 
	emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young 
	Man stops and looks at her.

				YOUNG MAN
		What?

				CAROL
		I...  I...  I don't know...  You got 
		me.

	His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited 
	but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the 
	fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her 
	mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt 
	opening her mouth. She stops him.

				CAROL
		Let me just do whatever I do by 
		myself...  I'll catch up to you 
		someplace I promise.
			(as he's put off)
		Oh, no...  don't look like that. 
		No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

	And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed 
	the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about 
	egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when 
	we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and 
	COUGHING.

				CAROL
		Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

	Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

				SPENCER (O.S.)
			(softly)
		Grandma, grandma... 

				YOUNG MAN
		Maybe you better check.

				CAROL
		Like what did you think I was 
		going to do?

	INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... 
	she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her 
	mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... 
	she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the 
	cough.

				BEVERLY
		I'm sorry. I was hearing just 
		everything you were doing so I put 
		these on to give you privacy.

	Carol now goes into her son's room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... 
	two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer 
	(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand 
	filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with 
	some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged 
	into the tiny space.

				SPENCER
		I'm sorry.

				CAROL
		Don't be silly. How bad?

				SPENCER
		Not bad.

	Carol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs -- 
	trying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each 
	know what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as 
	he throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She 
	loves him.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

				CAROL
			(a bit panicked)
		You can't smoke...  He can't take 
		smoke.

	He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand 
	squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his 
	hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he 
	picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking 
	at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to 
	cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

				CAROL
		Oh, God...  I don't even notice 
		anymore.

	She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make 
	light.

				CAROL
		That'll teach you.

				YOUNG MAN
		Don't apologize.

				CAROL
			(perturbed)
		That wasn't an apology.

	She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her -- 
	how uncomfortable he is.

				CAROL
		Hey...  this is just a little throw-
		up -- it's nothing to be so 
		embarrassed about. Really.
			(as he shifts 
			uncomfortably)
		Thanks for the dinner. Let me 
		write down which trains you take 
		to get back.

				YOUNG MAN
		No way.

	She brightens.

				YOUNG MAN
		I'll take a cab.

	She deflates as he moves past her.

				YOUNG MAN
		Too much reality for a Friday 
		night.

	EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

	A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the 
	approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN 
	and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and 
	the most likeable of the gritty little trio.

				EVAN
		Why is every customer surprised I 
		read books?

				DOUG
			(amazed)
		You read books?

				EVAN
		Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! 
		He even bought me dinner.

	They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in 
	front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through 
	the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

				CARL
			(slightly exasperated)
		Look, I just can't. I promised 
		Simon I'd find him a model.

				FRIEND (V.O.)
			(on speaker phone,
			flirting)
		Carl, take me off the speaker. 
		Did I tell you that these are 
		house seats? C'mon, you could use 
		a break. Hello...  Carl, are you 
		there...  hello?

	Seeing the hustlers:

				CARL
.		...  I just found a model.

				DOUG
			(to Carl)
		Hey, how it's goin'... 

				EVAN
		Hey, hi...  remember?

				CARL
		I only need one.

				EVAN
		You picked me up, maybe a few 
		weeks, I don't know, some time 
		ago. You were very flattering 
		about our...  encounter.

				CARL
		Maybe just you and me...  but this 
		is for a painting. I need a 
		pretty face.

	Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal 
	his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. 
	He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace 
	humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who 
	scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Sorry, I was out in the studio 
		doing some work and I forgot about 
		our appointment.

	He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away 
	-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him 
	and eyeing the expensive apartment.

				SIMON
		I usually make such a big deal out 
		of picking models but Carl's so 
		thorough. I'll bet he drove you 
		nuts checking your references.

	And he turns and sees the naked model.

				SIMON
			(taken aback)
		This isn't a nude.

	Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

				VINCENT
		Just kidding around.
			(then mutters)
		So much for love.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

	Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the 
	increasingly uneasy Simon.

				SIMON
		Exactly what is your previous 
		experience?

				VINCENT
		How about that pose?
			(sing-song)
		This is not fun... 
			(then)
		Give me some direction.

	Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He 
	tries not to show it.

				SIMON
		Nothing. I just watch till 
		something strikes me. Do anything 
		you think of -- try different 
		thing. Until I say, "hold that 
		pose." Then just try and 
		comfortably hold it.

				VINCENT
			(trying another space)
		The fact that you haven't said, 
		"hold it" means I haven't done it 
		right...  is that correct? I 
		haven't done it right?

				SIMON
		No...  Okay. What I do is watch 
		and wait for, um... You ever watch 
		someone who doesn't know you're 
		watching...  an old woman on a bus, 
		kids going to school and you see 
		this flash come over them and you 
		know immediately that it has 
		nothing to do with anything 
		external -- that it's in respond 
		to a private thought they just 
		had? They are just sort of realer 
		and more alive. And when you 
		notice it so are you. If you look 
		at someone long enough, you 
		discover their humanity.

	Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an 
	intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

				VINCENT
		I know exactly what you mean.

	There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

				SIMON
		Hold it.

	Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to 
	celebrate.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their 
	order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story 
	of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. 
	Carol is rapt.

	As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give 
	him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so 
	-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment 
	commentary on her every action.

				MELVIN
		Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- 
		she has to pretend she doesn't 
		hear me. Listening to the story 
		from the upset friend...  now she 
		drops off the cappuccino and 
		smiles at the putzette who doesn't 
		even say, "Thank you." No, the 
		putzette wanted the whipped cream 
		so back she goes and now she has 
		to pass him again and it's getting 
		tougher to make believe.

				CAROL
			(reluctant forgiveness)
		Okay.

	Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an 
	uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

				CAROL
		What's with the plastic picnic 
		ware? Why not try ours...  afraid 
		it isn't clean?

				MELVIN
		I see the help -- judgement call.

				CAROL
		Just give yourself a little pep 
		talk. "Must try other people's 
		clean silverware as part of the 
		fun of dining out."

				MELVIN
		What's wrong with your son, 
		anyway?

				CAROL
		What do you care?

	Melvin just looks at her.

				CAROL
		He's gotta fight to breathe. 
		His asthma can just shoot off the 
		charts -- he's allergic to dust 
		and this is New York and his 
		immune system bails on him when 
		there's trouble so an ear 
		infection...  Is this bothering 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(caught)
		No.

				CAROL
		An ear infection can send us to 
		the emergency room -- maybe five, 
		six times a month where I get 
		whatever nine-year-old they just 
		made a doctor. Nice chatting with 
		you.

				MELVIN
		His name?

				CAROL
		Spencer.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

				CAROL
			(quietly)
		Spence.

	She exits.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

	The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts 
	the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat 
	and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and 
	the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

				SIMON
		You can put on anything you want 
		now. I might be sort of done 
		here... 

	Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his 
	immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every 
	second of silence during the transition... then LOUD 
	MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon 
	does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down -- 
	which Vincent does.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT

	where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- 
	Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all 
	objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses 
	to look past the terrace to the studio.

				DOUG
		Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY

	MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

				VINCENT
		So you're practically finished, 
		huh?

				SIMON
		Yes...  well, there's one more 
		stage -- trying to figure out if 
		it's any good.

	Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another 
	perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod 
	of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate 
	to distract.

	CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his 
	ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to 
	frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

	As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the 
	canvas.

				VINCENT
		Wait -- I want to see the 
		painting.

				SIMON
		Just a second -- he has to go.

				VINCENT
		Please!! NO!!!

	Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a 
	bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown 
	to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized." 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL 
	stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

	Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he 
	continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing 
	them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

				SIMON
			(to Vincent)
		What's the matter, sweetheart?

	He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the 
	stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in. 
	Doug greets him.

				DOUG
		Yo.

	Simon turns to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Why are you doing this?

				VINCENT
		No. No. No. Hey, that painting 
		in there...  I just want to tell 
		you... 

	Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

				EVAN
			(to Vincent)
		What are you doing? Cruising him?

	And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a 
	club, as the brief savage attack begins.

	ON VERDELL

	as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in 
	fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single 
	BARK from VERDELL.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK

	A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is 
	whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if 
	Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the 
	wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

				RAY
		Okay. So you call 911 and don't 
		leave your name -- even a dumb 
		geezer should know that emergency 
		automatically pulls up your name. 
		How come you make a mistake like 
		that?

				MELVIN
		How come you're pretending to do 
		cop work -- 'cause I don't think 
		you could find your ass if you 
		were spotted the hole.

				RAY
			(stunned)
		What?

				MELVIN
		Just move on. No one here killed 
		him.

				RAY
		Oh, is he dead?

				MELVIN
		Ask him.

				RAY
		We will if we can and if we can't, 
		we'll come back and ask you again 
		and again.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - 
	ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

	Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a 
	leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic 
	little CRYING SOUNDS.

	As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the 
	Sweet-Faced Woman.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I've been praying for him since I 
		heard.

				FRANK
		So I've got to get to the 
		hospital. If you could take the 
		dog just for tonight.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, Lord -- I've got all these 
		antique knick-knacks...  Or else 
		I'd be glad... 

				FRANK
		Maybe if you kept locked in 
		the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
			(as he turns away and she 
			closes the door he adds)
		Old bitch...  Damn dog.

	A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed 
	and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings... 

	VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches 
	his mugger:

				FRANK
		You're taking him...  yes...  you're 
		taking him -- this will clear the 
		books. One night. You want to 
		say "no" to me? Try...  because 
		I've never felt as nuts as I do 
		right this second. I almost want 
		you to try saying "no."

				MELVIN
			(quietly)
		I'm not saying nothing to you.

				FRANK
		Thanks for looking after him.

	Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and 
	places Verdell inside.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to 
	block Verdell's escape.

	The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped 
	in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We 
	STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head 
	turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue 
	continues O.S.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Hey, where are you going? You 
		can't do this.
			(calls after Frank)
		I can't take a dog.
			(a confession)
		Nobody's ever been in here before.

				FRANK (O.S.)
			(threatening)
		You don't want to mess with me 
		today. I'll figure something else 
		out tomorrow.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now 
	Melvin sees him.

				MELVIN
		You're dead!!

	VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking 
	along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a 
	bit calming.

				MELVIN
		I don't have dog food. And I 
		won't want dog food here. You'll 
		eat what we have. You'll eat what 
		we eat.

	Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped 
	meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the 
	room.

				MELVIN
		Don't you touch anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC 
	CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and 
	exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking 
	alternately in all directions... his recent past making 
	him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs 
	cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a 
	dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound 
	of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then 
	MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he 
	sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd. 
	Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl 
	with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and 
	sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of 
	Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks 
	over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts 
	and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out 
	the lights and exits.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

	Frank on the phone.

				FRANK
			(into phone)
		Put the solid red dots on three of 
		them and the hold blue dots on two 
		others...  Well, we're not going to 
		sell anything if they know we're 
		two weeks into a show and have no 
		sales. No, you can't reduce a 
		price at this stage...  We're in 
		free fall here. Any calls?

				JACKIE
		We can see him.

				FRANK
		I'll meet you in there.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	As Jackie enters.

				JACKIE
		How you doing, great one?

				SIMON
		I haven't looked at myself yet. I 
		figured I could tell from your 
		reaction.

	He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his 
	painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a 
	horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into 
	yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into 
	tears...  sobs, actually.

				SIMON
		That bad, huh?

	They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in 
	the doorway.

				FRANK
		Hey, hey... 
			(as he sees him)
		Haaa...  bad but temporary. The 
		nurses say it's much better than 
		you looked three weeks ago...  the 
		hand will come back...  they're 
		sure... 

				SIMON
		Jackie, will you hand me the 
		mirror?

				JACKIE
			(a small voice)
		No.

	She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- 
	then thinks better of it.

				JACKIE
		Wait, I have a smaller one.

	But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- 
	he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

				SIMON
		So, what's new anyway? How's 
		Verdell?

				FRANK
			(sheepish)
		Your neighbor -- Udall -- is 
		taking care of him.

				SIMON
			(suddenly alive and upset)
		How could you do that? He'll hurt 
		him.

				FRANK
		No, I promise...  not a chance. I 
		own this guy. There was no one 
		else. I'm on the move too much. 
		Trust me.

				SIMON
		You are very certain my dog is 
		okay...  because you have no 
		idea... 

				FRANK
		Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

	Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, 
	then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive 
	underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

				SIMON
		Okay, waiting gives the devil 
		time. Now!

	He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...  
	he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him 
	awed by his misfortune.

				SIMON
		Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

	EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with 
	his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as 
	she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning 
	periodically to keep an eye of his dog.

				CAROL
		So what are you doing with a dog?

				MELVIN
		Suckered in. Set up. Pushed 
		around.

				CAROL
		You're not worried that someone 
		might take him?

				MELVIN
		Well, not until now -- for 
		Christ's sake.

				CAROL
		Sorry.

				MELVIN
		It's okay -- I'll sit here.

	He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can 
	keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

				CAROL
		You know he's a little dog. Next 
		time, if Bryan's not here, you can 
		bring him in.

				MELVIN
		How old are you?

				CAROL
		Oh, please... 

				MELVIN
		If I had to guess by your eyes, 
		I'd say you were fifty.

	Carol looks at him.

				CAROL
		And if I had to guess by your 
		eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, 
		so much for eyes. But as long as 
		you bring up age...  how old are 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(quickly)
		Otherwise, you're not ugly.

				CAROL
			(laughs out loud)
		Okay, pal...  I accept the 
		compliment, but go easy -- my 
		knees start a-knocking when you 
		turn on the charm full blast.

				MELVIN
		What's with the dark?

	He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

				CAROL
		Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. 
		My son had a full blown attack. 
		And this time, for extra fun, they 
		gave us the wrong antibiotics, so 
		I get him home... 

	She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes 
	nuts.

				MELVIN
		No...  no...  leave it...  the 
		bacon's for the dog.

	She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, 
	but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

				MELVIN
		Last week I was playing the piano 
		for him and he likes it, and so I 
		decide I'm going to make a little 
		joke... 

				CAROL
		You all set here?

	Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to 
	finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a 
	beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is 
	avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.

				MELVIN
		It's a beautiful day for our walk.

	Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

	ON VERDELL

	again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the 
	sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic 
	gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.

				MELVIN
		Don't be like me, don't you be 
		like me. You stay just the way 
		you are because you are a perfect 
		man. I'm gonna take you home and 
		get you something to eat...  what 
		you love.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				FEMALE PASSERSBY
			(charmed)
		Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like 
		that.

				MELVIN
			(all smiles to Verdell)
		Let's go home and do some writing.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself 
	with great satisfaction as he goes.

	Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his 
	master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing 
	aloud to the dog.

				MELVIN
		"He turned off the gas jets and 
		carried her outside. He kissed 
		her brow and when her eyes opened 
		and found him, he said, 'there are 
		easier ways to break a date.' She 
		laughed. The only sensible 
		ambition he had ever known was now 
		realized. He had made the girl 
		happy. And what a girl. 'You've 
		saved my life,' she said, 'you'd 
		better make it up to me.'"

	Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine... 

				MELVIN
			(singing to Verdell)
		Done!
			(playing with him some)
		Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I 
		hate the doggy.

	He exits.

				MELVIN (V.O.)
		Sixty-two books... done!

	As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our 
	couple's play time for... 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

	As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul 
	mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the 
	maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few 
	words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and 
	talk of how long Nora can stay on.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

				FRANK
		How's Verdell doing?

				MELVIN
		He's a pain in the ass.

	As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, 
	without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's 
	surprise.

				FRANK
		Simon's home. I was sort of 
		hoping you could keep the dog 
		until he's had a chance to think 
		and adjust... 

				MELVIN
			(leaping at the chance)
		It's been five weeks...  another 
		few won't kill me.

				FRANK
		No. He wants him back. He'll be 
		by tomorrow.

				MELVIN
			(too loudly, weirdly)
		Okay by me.

	Frank exits.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to 
	the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are 
	locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the 
	correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to 
	check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished, 
	until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

	INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

	Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a 
	wheelchair and shudders... 

				MELVIN
		That's some face they left hanging 
		on you. You look like... 

				SIMON
			(interrupting)
		Could you take it just a little 
		easy, Mr. Udall?

	A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

				SIMON
		Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?
			(to Melvin)
		By the way, thanks for saving me.

				MELVIN
		I called. I never touched you. I 
		didn't leave my name or nothing.

				SIMON
			(not listening)
		Verdell?

	ON VERDELL

	Totally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin 
	shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon 
	smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the 
	reunion.

				SIMON
		Hi, sweetheart.

	Verdell isn't eager.

	ON SIMON

	The first gnawing pains of rejection.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get 
	Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the 
	door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog 
	up.

				SIMON
		No. Please, don't force him.

				JACKIE
			(to dog)
		You little stinker. He's given 
		you everything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	MELVIN'S POV

	Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and 
	hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...  
	there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly 
	one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels 
	the panic rise in him... 

	...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and 
	now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

				MELVIN
		Over the dog...  an ugly dog.

	It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual 
	sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite 
	pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but 
	highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared, 
	beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

	Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then 
	turning into a building with a copper sign reading 
	"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."

				MELVIN
		Worst sidewalk in New York and 
		look where they put in.

	INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

				MELVIN
		Help!

				DOCTOR
		If you want to see me you will not 
		do this. You will make an 
		appointment... 

				MELVIN
		Explain to me how you can diagnose 
		someone as "obsessive compulsive 
		disorder" and then act like I have 
		any choice in barging in.

				DOCTOR
		There's not going to be a debate. 
		You must leave.

	The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to 
	follow.

				MELVIN
		You said you could help me -- 
		what was that -- a tease?

				DOCTOR
		I can help you if you take the 
		responsibility to keep regular 
		app --

				MELVIN
			(suddenly)
		You changed the room around... 

				DOCTOR
		Two years ago... 

	Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough 
	he must go through a careful exercise noting every new 
	element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies 
	each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued 
	despite himself.

				DOCTOR
		I also regrew my beard...  but 
		you're not interested in changes 
		in me... so it's like I always 
		told you...  when it comes to 
		people you... 

				MELVIN
		Shhhhhhh. I don't have this 
		mountain of available time...  I 
		got to get to my restaurant on 
		time. Do you know how hard it is 
		for me to be here?

				DOCTOR
		Yes.
			(as Melvin starts 
			for the office)
		No.

	INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY

	More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin 
	passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. 
	Eyes on them. Then:

				MELVIN
			(to other patients)
		What if this is as good as it 
		gets?

	They look stricken. He exits.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief. 
	CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his 
	table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils 
	and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT 
	AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl 
	looks at his utensils.

				CHERYL
		What the heck are those for?

				MELVIN
		No. No. Get Carol.

				CHERYL
		I'm filling in. We don't know if 
		she's coming back. She might have 
		to get a job closer to home.

				MELVIN
		What are you trying to do to me?

				CHERYL
		What the heck do you mean?

				MELVIN
		Hey, elephant girl, call her or 
		something...  just let her do my 
		one meal here. I'll pay whatever. 
		I'll wait.
			(as she doesn't 
			budge; he screams)
		Do it!!!

	The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police 
	that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

				MANAGER
		Out. Be silent or leave.

				MELVIN
		I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. 
		No problem. Get her here -- have 
		her get me two sausages, four 
		bacon, two eggs over easy and 
		coffee. I'm not a prick here -- 
		I'm a great customer. This day is 
		a disaster. I can't handle this, 
		too.

				MANAGER
		Get out immediately or there's 
		going to be trouble.

	Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless 
	situation and rises.

				MELVIN
		There's going to be trouble???

	He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other 
	employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near 
	the door he hands him 20 dollars.

				MELVIN
		Carol's last name?

				BUSBOY
		Connelly.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

	An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

	MELVIN'S POV

	A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever 
	the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of 
	community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving 
	their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local 
	store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

	EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY

	Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. 
	She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a 
	thermometer.

				MELVIN
		I'm hungry.
			(on Carol's astonished 
			look)
		You've upset my whole day. I 
		haven't eaten.

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge 
	he had imagined she might make... 

				MELVIN
		This is not a sexist thing. If 
		you were a waiter I would still be 
		here saying... 

				CAROL
		Are you totally gone? This is my 
		private home... 

				MELVIN
		I am trying to keep emotions out of 
		this. Even though this is an 
		important issue to me and I have 
		strong feelings about the subject.

				CAROL
		What subject? That I wasn't there 
		to take crap from you and bring 
		you eggs? Do you have any control 
		over how creepy you allow yourself 
		to get?

				MELVIN
		Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... 
		and to prove it I have not gotten 
		personal and you have. Why aren't 
		you at work? You're not sick -- 
		you don't look sick... just very 
		tired and bitter.

				CAROL
		My son is sick, okay?

	Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some 
	emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy 
	man at her threshold.

				MELVIN
		What about your mother?

				CAROL
		How do you know about my mother?

				MELVIN
		I hear you talk when I'm 
		waiting!!!

	She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a 
	step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into 
	the room.

				CAROL
		Sorry, honey...  I'll be right 
		there.

				MELVIN
			(uncomfortably)
		How ya doing?

	Spencer just stares at him.

				MELVIN
			(miffed)
		You should answer when someone 
		talks to you... 

	Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then 
	emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs 
	out the door.

				CAROL
		Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, 
		and I can't handle you teaching 
		my son manners.

	She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son 
	and leads him back to his room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM

	CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of 
	Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his 
	ear. They both count down the seconds.

				CAROL AND SPENCER
		5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo.

				SPENCER
		104.9

				CAROL
		We are going to treat ourselves to 
		a cab ride.

	EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol carries her young son through a class of 
	uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She 
	spots Melvin about to enter a cab.

				CAROL
		Melvin, wait!

	The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

				SCHOOL KIDS
		Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! 
		Melvin, wait!

	He turns to face them.

				MELVIN
		Shut up, kids!

	They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

				CAROL
		Melvin...  give us a lift. We've 
		got to go see our friends at the 
		hospital.

	Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the 
	rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The 
	maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

				MELVIN
		I'll ride up front. Cover your 
		mouth when you cough, kid.

	INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY

	As they settle in and drive off.

				CAROL
		Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, 
		please and quickly please.

	EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

	As Carol enters the hospital.

				CAROL
			(calling back)
		I owe you three dollars.

	Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son... 

				MELVIN
		Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll 
		get back to work today?

				CAROL
			(furiously)
		No!!! Stay away from me!

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for 
	Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...  
	she has some index cards in her laps which she 
	occasionally consults and shuffles.

				JACKIE
		I feel terrible that I have to... 
		Simon? Forget about the dog for a 
		second.

	Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

				SIMON
		Sorry. What are those cards?

				JACKIE
			(a bit embarrassed)
		Frank's idea. He thought I should 
		have notes so I did this right... 
		maintained focus, didn't get 
		emotional and tried not to terrify 
		you.

				SIMON
			(scared shitless)
		Terrify me?

				JACKIE
		See, he's right. I need the 
		cards.
			(reading from cards)
		Simon, you're broke.

	ANGLE ON VERDELL

	as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

				JACKIE (O.S.)
		The medical bill are 61 thousand 
		now. I've spoken to your parents 
		and they didn't hang up or 
		anything -- they just said they 
		would feel strange calling you.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Well, I can't reach them.

	Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns 
	for:

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		Here, baby...  what is it, 
		Verdell?...  You miss the tough 
		guy... 
			(trying to be 
			Melvin-like)
		Well, here I am, you little pissant 
		mop, happy to see me? How about 
		another ride down the chute? Oh, 
		God...  I don't mean it, 
		sweetheart... 
			(on Jackie's look)
		I'm sorry. I know... 

	Verdell hides behind a chair.

				JACKIE
		Frank loves you. You know that... 
		but I've spoken to him and he 
		feels that --
			(reading from card)
		-- as a businessman, with limited 
		resources... 

				SIMON
		I'll be able to keep my apartment 
		and studio, won't I?...  Just tell 
		me.

	As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

				SIMON
			(overwhelmed)
		Wow... 

	Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet 
	the dog and the dog ducks.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset. 
	He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He 
	is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

	INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

	We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening 
	with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering 
	phone calls, "Premier Publishing."

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
		Yes, you write more than anyone 
		else. Yes, you make us a lot of 
		money, but isn't there someone 
		more appropriate to... 

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I need this. Just say, "Melvin, 
		I'll try," okay?

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
			(resigned)
		Melvin, I'll try.

	They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She 
	pauses at the elevator.

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE
		Now, on a pleasant note, our son 
		got accepted at Brown. My 
		husband... 

				MELVIN
			(curtly)
		Great, wonderful. I don't need 
		you to wait with me.

	She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe 
	summons her moxie.

				ZOE
		I can't resist. You usually move 
		through here so quickly and I have 
		so many questions I want to ask 
		you. You have no idea what your 
		work means to me.

				MELVIN
		What's it mean?

				ZOE
		That somebody out there knows what 
		it's like to be... 
			(taps her head and heart)
		in here.

				MELVIN
		Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

				ZOE
		Aw come on, just a couple of 
		questions -- how hard is that?

	As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button 
	etc.

				ZOE
		How do you write women so well?

				MELVIN
			(as he turns 
			toward her)
		I think of a man and take away 
		reason and accountability.

	The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

	EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is 
	suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

	CAROL'S POV

	A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As Carol breaks into a run.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY

	As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and 
	jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering 
	sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

				CAROL
		Hello? Hello?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

	The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, 
	her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk 
	on opening day of the hunting season.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY

				CAROL
		What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

				DR. BETTES
		Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
		...  Dr. Bettes.

				CAROL
		Not your name...  what are you 
		telling me your name for!! Where 
		is he?

				DR. BETTES
		He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

				CAROL
			(overlapping)
		Tell me how bad it is. I let him 
		go out last night when it was so 
		cool without an overshirt -- just 
		and underone with just the straps 
		and I know better...  and I let him 
		talk me into it. He was whining 
		and...  you don't need this. Give 
		me a second to catch hold.

	And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some 
	notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it 
	takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and 
	she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer 
	enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now. 
	Salvation as farce.

				SPENCER
			(to his mother)
		Hi... 
			(they kiss)
		Did you know there are doctors who 
		come to your house?

				CAROL
		No, I didn't.
			(to Bettes)
		So why are you h... 

	Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient 
	which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

				BEVERLY
		I didn't know you had a secret 
		admire.

				CAROL
		Huh?

				BEVERLY
		You met the gift.

				SPENCER
		He's good...  And I'm an expert on 
		doctors.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		Stay out of this...  Doctor?

				DR. BETTES
		My wife is Melvin Udall's 
		publisher.
			(as Carol reacts)
		She says I have to take great care 
		of this guy because you're 
		urgently needed back at work. 
		What work do you do?

				CAROL
		I'm a waitress.

	ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

				BEVERLY
		In Manhattan.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Bettes?

				DR. BETTES
		In here.

	A NURSE enters.

				NURSE
		Sorry it took so long. I don't 
		know Brooklyn.

				DR. BETTES
		It's okay, Terry.
			(hands her blood 
			vail)
		Tell the lab I'd like the report 
		back today.

	Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

				CAROL
		You're going to get the results 
		today?!

	MOVING SHOT

	As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from 
	each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation. 
	Bettes is examining medicine bottles.

				DR. BETTES
		How long has he been having 
		problems?

				CAROL
		Since forever.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done blood tests on him?

				CAROL
		Yes.

				DR. BETTES
		Only in the emergency room or when 
		he was well.

				CAROL
		Emergency room only.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done skin testing for 
		allergies?

				CAROL
		No.

				DR. BETTES
		They haven't done the standard 
		scratch test. Where they make 
		small injections into the skin?

				CAROL
		No. I asked. They said it's not 
		covered under my plan. And it's 
		not necessary anyway.

				DR. BETTES
		It's amazing these things weren't 
		done.

				CAROL
		Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of 
		shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

				DR. BETTES
		No. Actually, I think that's 
		their technical name.

				CAROL
		Once the tests come back, is there 
		someone I can reach in your office 
		for the results?

				DR. BETTES
		Me. My home number is on this 
		card.

				CAROL
		His home number.

	Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly 
	has a hard time stopping.

				CAROL
			(to doctor)
		Do you want some juice or coffee 
		or two female slaves?

				DR. BETTES
		Water...  Nobody told you it might 
		be a good idea to remove the 
		carpeting and drapes in Spencer's 
		room?

				CAROL
		No.

	She starts towards Spencer's room.

				DR. BETTES
		You don't have to do it this 
		second...  it's not dangerous or 
		anything. It's just something 
		that's advisable. Look, there's 
		a lot to be checked but...  Hey, 
		your son is going to feel a 
		good deal better at the very 
		least... 

	She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce 
	intimacy.

				CAROL
		Doc!!!
			(then)
		So listen, you gotta let me know 
		about the additional costs -- one 
		way or the other we'll... 

				DR. BETTES
		They're considerable. But Mr. 
		Udall wants to be billed.

	She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained 
	Nora hugs him good-bye.

				NORA
		You poor, poor man.

				SIMON
		Let's use just one poor, okay? 
		Anyway, dear, thanks for 
		everything. Forgive my recent 
		crankiness and as soon as things 
		are on track again I'll call.

	She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a 
	sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				NORA
		Who's going to walk Verdell?

	Simon hadn't thought of this either.

				SIMON
		No, no.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY

	Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin 
	opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

				MELVIN
		Is he dead yet?

				NORA
		No! Would there be any way for 
		you to be willing to walk his dog 
		for him?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely.

				NORA
		Not just today -- Uh, could you 
		do it -- until, until he gets 
		back on his feet?

				MELVIN
		Sure thing.

				NORA
		You're a wonderful man. Two 
		o'clock is a good time. Here's 
		the key in case he's asleep. Open 
		the curtains for him, so he sees 
		God's beautiful work and knows 
		that even things like this happen 
		for the best.

				MELVIN
		Where'd they teach you to talk 
		like this -- some Panama City 
		"Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? 
		Or was today getaway day and your 
		last shot at his whiskey. Sell 
		crazy some place else -- we're all 
		stocked up here.

	He closes the door in her face. She stands there... 
	thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper 
	shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the 
	elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then 
	continues on her way.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT

	The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

				CAROL
		There is a seriously goofy man 
		behind this. You are not allowed 
		to block out that fact.

				BEVERLY
		Do you really want to go back to 
		the runt doctors in Emergency who 
		keep telling us they can't help?

				CAROL
		It lets a crazy man into our 
		lives.

				BEVERLY
		Come on. Why fight when we know 
		how it will come out. This isn't 
		like stocking or a string of 
		pearls. You don't send this one 
		back.

	EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS. 
	He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that 
	reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult 
	struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he 
	answers.

				SIMON
		Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally, 
		huh? Why, "finally"? Because I 
		called you so many times. Maybe 
		20.
			(relief)
		Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was 
		something like that. You didn't 
		get one of them, huh? 'Cause I 
		mean it wasn't only your office -- 
		it was your home, hotel and the 
		cigar club you like in San 
		Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of 
		course. I believe you. No, don't 
		fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm 
		wrong about the 20 times. Take a 
		breath... 
			(more)
		So, you miss me a little? Hey, 
		strike the question -- How's the 
		case going? Really. Fantastic. 
		I didn't hear. I haven't been 
		watching. Great. Just great. 
		I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me? 
		Well, I'm mending. No, I look 
		fine. Well, some of the damage 
		might still be noticeable if you 
		look closely... 

	He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and 
	beaten face... 

				SIMON
		Carl, I need some help and you're 
		the logical one to turn to.
			(aghast)
		No! Not 'cause I blame you for 
		what happened. I hardly get how 
		you can ever think that. No, I'm 
		not being sarcastic.
			(trying to figure it 
			out)
		I guess because you hired the guy 
		who did this you think...  No, I am 
		a sarcastic person. Well, if 
		you must know, the reason I said 
		you were the logical person is 
		because you always told me how you 
		thought I was this great person 
		who made you feel good about 
		humanity and everything. You do 
		remembering saying that? Well, whew. 
		Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but 
		this money thing is ridiculously 
		serious... 

	He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes 
	the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

				SIMON
		"Will you please loan me money? I 
		will pay you back. I will give 
		you whatever percentage of my 
		income I don't absolutely need 
		until I do. It will take a while. 
		But I don't know what I'll do if 
		you say"... that.
			(as he listens)
		I understand...  yes...  No, I do.
			(a bit of boldness)
		But you know, you know -- you 
		didn't even ask how much, Carl? 
		Well, Frank has no right to 
		discuss how much I'm in hock... 
		no, you're right -- not the point. 
		So...  what have you been up to??? 
		Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...  
		how was it? Well, I'm not 
		surprised that there's that much 
		talent around...  great...  Look -- 
		gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel 
		that way at all...  take care, you, 
		too...  you, too...  Good-bye.
			(as he hangs up)
		Pal o' mine.

	It's very quiet.

	LONG SHOT - SIMON

	A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his 
	face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional 
	release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous 
	with the moment of catharsis... 

	...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the 
	CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to 
	focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering 
	the room.

				MELVIN
		Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

				SIMON
		Thank you for walking him.

	Simon wheels away from Melvin.

				SIMON
		If you'll excuse me I'm not 
		feeling so well.

				MELVIN
		It smells like shit in here?

				SIMON
		Go away.

				MELVIN
		That cleaning woman doesn't... 

				SIMON
		Please, just leave.

				MELVIN
		Where are all your queer party 
		friends?

				SIMON
			(his first shout)
		Get out.

	Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon 
	with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

				SIMON
		Nothing worse than having to feel 
		this way in front of you?

				MELVIN
		Nellie, you're a disgrace to 
		depression.

				SIMON
		Rot in hell, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		No need to stop being a lady... 
		quit worrying -- you'll be back on 
		your knees in no time.

	Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden 
	attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

				SIMON
		Is this fun for you? Well, you 
		lucky devil...  It just gets better 
		and better. I am losing my 
		apartment and Frank wants me to 
		promise to paint hotter subjects 
		and to beg my parents, who haven't 
		called, for help... and I won't. 
		And I don't want to paint anymore.

	Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.

				SIMON
		So the life I was trying for is 
		over. The life I had is gone and 
		I am feeling so damn sorry for 
		myself that it is difficult to 
		breathe. Right times for you -- 
		huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is 
		terrified... 
			(a sudden screamed 
			word surprises them 
			both)
		Terrified...  Lucky you, you're 
		here for rock bottom...  me 
		wallowing in self-pity in front of 
		you, you absolute horror of a 
		human being... 

	As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with 
	discomfort.

				MELVIN
		Well, I'll do one thing for you 
		that might cheer you up.

				SIMON
		Get out.

				MELVIN
		Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. 
		You want to know why the dog 
		prefers me...  it's not affection. 
		It's a trick.

	Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's 
	rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

				MELVIN
		I carry bacon in my pocket.

				SIMON
			(pleased)
		Oh, my gosh.

				MELVIN
			(hands him bacon)
		Now we'll both call him.

				SIMON
		Come on, sweetheart... 

				MELVIN
		Yo, yo, yo... 

	Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally 
	surprised and staggered by the implications. True love 
	and such.

				SIMON
		Would you leave now, please?

				MELVIN
		Stupid dog.
			(to Simon)
		I don't get it.

	He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic 
	ruin.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...  She is in turmoil... 
	there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen. 
	She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

	INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol 
	shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

	Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving 
	her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy 
	here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer 
	dress -- no time for underwear.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

	Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

	EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM

	Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on 
	her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the 
	subject.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING - 
	NIGHT (RAIN)

	Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the 
	rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood.

	ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE

	As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on 
	it.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)

	As she enters building and realizes it's not just that 
	she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet 
	T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts, 
	like the old movie poster of The Deep.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of 
	Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness 
	and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally 
	Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side 
	of the door.

				CAROL
		Uh, Udall?

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Carol the waitress?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her 
	breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it 
	straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is 
	static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it 
	self-conscious pats.

				CAROL
		The doctors had your billing 
		address. I'm sorry about the 
		hour.

				MELVIN
		I was working...  can't you just 
		drop me a thank-you note?

				CAROL
		That's not why I'm here... 
			(tearing suddenly)
		...  though you have no idea what 
		it's like to have a real 
		conversation with a doctor about 
		Spencer... 

				MELVIN
			(very uncomfortable)
		Note. Put it in the note.

				CAROL
		Why did yo do this for me?

				MELVIN
		To get you back at work so you can 
		wait on me.

				CAROL
		But you do have some idea how 
		strange that sounds??? I'm 
		worried that you did this 
		because... 

	She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long 
	silence. Finally.

				MELVIN
		You waiting for me to say 
		something?
			(as she shakes her head)
		What sort of thing do you want? 
		Look, I'll be at the restaurant 
		tomorrow.

				CAROL
		I don't think I can wait until 
		tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

				MELVIN
		What needs clearing up?

				CAROL
			(strong and true)
		I'm not going to sleep with you. 
		I will never, ever sleep with you. 
		Never. Not ever.

	Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the 
	brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to 
	scream --

	-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt 
	during his half turn away from her -- and then answer 
	hoarsely.

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry. We don't open for the 
		no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

	Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way 
	ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.

				CAROL
		I'm not kidding.

				MELVIN
		Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

				CAROL
		Just how grateful I am.

	Her mission completed -- she turns.

				MELVIN
		So you'll be at work?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's 
	night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've 
	seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor 
	twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his 
	body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

	He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays 
	very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his 
	forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light 
	on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator... 

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR - 
	NIGHT

	As he grabs a cardboard take-out box... 

	INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.
	
	He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.

	SIMON'S APARTMENT

				MELVIN
		I took a chance you were up.

	Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

				MELVIN
		I brought you Chinese soup.

				SIMON
		Thanks.

				MELVIN
		I have never been so tired in my 
		life. Okay, if I sit here?

				SIMON
		Got any easier questions?

	Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

				MELVIN
		I haven't been sleeping. I 
		haven't been clear or felt like 
		myself. I'm in trouble. Some son 
		of a bitch is burning my bridges 
		behind my back...  But the 
		tiredness -- boy...  Not just 
		sleepy.

				SIMON
		But sick -- nauseous -- where 
		everything looks distorted and 
		everything inside just aches -- 
		when you can barely get up the 
		will to complain.

				MELVIN
			(brightening)
		Yeah... 

	He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to 
	take it from here.

				MELVIN
		I'm glad we did this.

	He rises and makes an awkward exit.

				MELVIN
		Good talking to you.

	He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to 
	express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed 
	pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't 
	even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and 
	is let in by Beverly.

	They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly 
	hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over 
	Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and 
	emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my 
	conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how 
	gratefull (sic)... "

				BEVERLY
		You're not still writing that 
		thank-you note?

				CAROL
		I'm on the last page. How do you 
		spell conscience?

				BEVERLY
		C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean 
		from the bakery to baby-sit so 
		let's go out.

				CAROL
		I still don't feel safe leaving 
		Spencer with someone. How do you 
		spell it again?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer is okay. You'd better 
		start finding something else to do 
		with your free time. If you can't 
		feel good about this break and 
		step out a little... 
			(struts and pumps 
			her arms)
		You ought to get Mr. Udall to send 
		you over a psychiatrist.

				CAROL
			(more emotionally 
			than she intended)
		I don't need one 'cause I know 
		what's really going on here. I 
		have to finish this letter or 
		I'll go nuts.
			(looking at paper; 
			weepy)
		This can't be right -- con-
		science.

	Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself 
	on the brink of crying.

				BEVERLY
		Carol. What?

	Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able 
	to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she 
	looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission 
	for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol 
	-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

				CAROL
		I don't know... It's very strange 
		not feeling that stupid panic 
		thing inside you all the time. 
		Without that you just start 
		thinking about yourself -- and 
		what does that ever get anybody. 
		Today, on the bus there was this 
		adorable couple and I felt myself 
		giving them a dirty look -- I had 
		no idea everything was... 

				BEVERLY
		Go ahead.

				CAROL
			(great, forceful 
			hand gestures)
		... moving in the wrong 
		direction... Away from when I 
		even remembered what it was like 
		to have a man to... anything... 
		hold fucking -- sorry -- hands 
		with, for Christ's sake. I was 
		feeling like really bad that Dr. 
		Bettes is married.
			(this next one's 
			tough)
		Which is probably why I make poor 
		Spencer hug me more than he wants 
		to... Like the poor kid doesn't 
		have enough problems. He has to 
		make up for his mom not getting 
		any.
			(weeps at her 
			insight)
		Oh, boy. Who needs these 
		thoughts?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer's doing fine. So what are 
		you saying, that you're frustr... 

				CAROL
		Leave me be! Why are you doing 
		this? Why are you picking at my 
		sores... What is it that you 
		want?... You want what? What's 
		with you? I hope getting me 
		thinking of everything that's 
		wrong when all I want is to not 
		do this has some purpose.
			(puffy; red; 
			furious)
		What is it, Mom? No kidding.

	Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked 
	husky voiced question.

				CAROL
		What is it you want? What?

				BEVERLY
		I want us to go out.

	A beat, then.

				CAROL
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their 
	cry.

				CAROL
			(to Sean)
		We're going out.

				SEAN
			(looking at their 
			red eyes)
		Looks like fun.

	She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what 
	he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

				CAROL
		Okay -- we're out of here. I love 
		you.

	Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol 
	as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. 
	Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, 
	going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then 
	to her son to ask:

				CAROL
		Do you love me?

				SPENCER
		Uh-huh.

	Carol exits.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY

	Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A 
	simple and unprecedented experience in their recent 
	lives.

				BEVERLY
		Nice to get out, isn't it?

	Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each 
	other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 
	14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated 
	at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa 
	keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.

				CAROL
		Don't get it wet.

	Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

				CAROL
		So it's okay?

				LISA
		You almost have me liking him. 
		You sure come from the heart. I 
		never knew what you went through 
		with everything.

				CAROL
		I wanted him to know how much he'd 
		done.
			(looking over)
		Can you believe he's eating with 
		someone.

	ON MELVIN & FRANK

				MELVIN
		It's not my dog and this Simon 
		seems to have enough on his mind 
		-- but he did throw up twice and 
		his spark is off.

				FRANK
		Sure -- take him to the vet.

				MELVIN
		I did. And his stomach is out of 
		whack. So they need him for a 
		couple of days.

				FRANK
		Do it.

				CAROL
		Melvin.

	She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

				MELVIN
		What's this?

				CAROL
			(sotto)
		A thank-you note for what you did 
		for me.

	He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and 
	walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, 
	confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.

	After Carol leaves... 

				FRANK
		She's nice.

				MELVIN
			(to Frank)
		Really nice. Shouldn't that be a 
		good thing... telling someone, 
		'no thanks required.'

				FRANK
		It looks like it really went over. 
		You're sure making the rounds. 
		Simon says you brought him soup 
		last night. I hope he doesn't 
		write you a note.

	Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing 
	message.

				FRANK
		What?

				MELVIN
		"What?" Look at you... You sense 
		a mark.

				FRANK
		Hey -- you called me... I... 

				MELVIN
		About a dog.

				FRANK
		Yeah, but it's all about Simon 
		now... you helped with the dog... 
		And now there are other things. 
		I'm just as concerned as you are 
		about Simon.

				MELVIN
		Concerned. I'm just the hall 
		monitor here.

				FRANK
		It's not only financial 
		assistance. What he's got to do 
		is go to Baltimore tomorrow and 
		ask his parents for money. It's 
		not going to happen on the phone.

				MELVIN
		Yeah. If his parents are alive 
		they've got to help -- those are 
		the rules. Good.

				FRANK
		Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high 
		maintenance selling painter coming 
		through... So I'm out. Can you 
		take him?

				MELVIN
		Think white and get serious.

	Carol enters scene.

				FRANK
		Take my car -- a convertible. Do 
		you drive?

				MELVIN
			(loudly)
		Like the wind but I'm not doing 
		it.

				CAROL
		Getting loud, getting loud.

				MELVIN
		He wants me to take his car and 
		his client to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		I want your life for a minute 
		where my big problem is someone 
		offers me a free convertible so I 
		can get out of this city.

	She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

				MELVIN
		Okay. I'll take him. Get him 
		packed -- ready -- tomorrow 
		morning.

	Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

				MELVIN
			(excited)
		Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. 
		Let's not drag this out. We don't 
		enjoy another that much.

				FRANK
		If there's some mental health 
		foundation that raises money to 
		help people like you be sure to 
		let me know.

				MELVIN
		Last word freak.

	Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a 
	"good-bye" to him.

				CAROL
		So. Anything else?

				MELVIN
		Yes. I'm going to give my queer 
		neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		Okay.

				MELVIN
		Hey, what I did for you is working 
		out?

				CAROL
			(a breath; then)
		What you did changed my life.

	She offers him the note.

				MELVIN
		No... no thank you notes.

				CAROL
		Well, part of what I said in this 
		entire history of my life which 
		you won't read is that somehow 
		you've done more for my mother, my 
		son and me, than anyone else ever 
		has... And that makes you the most 
		important, surprising, generous 
		person I've ever met and that you 
		be in our daily prayers forever.

				MELVIN
		Lovely.

				CAROL
		I also wrote one part... I wrote 
		I'm sorry... I was talking about I 
		was sorry when I got mad at you 
		when you came over and you told my 
		son that he ought to answer back 
		so I wrote that.
			(reading from the 
			letter, Melvin 
			wildly uncomfortable)
		I was sorry for busting you on 
		that... and I'm sorry for busting 
		in on you that night... when I 
		said I was never... I was sorry 
		and I'm sorry every time your food 
		was cold and that you had to wait 
		two seconds for a coffee filler... 

	Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- 
	emotionally moved by her own words.

				CAROL
		... and I'm sorry for never 
		spotting, right there at the table 
		in the restaurant, the human being 
		that had it in him to do this 
		thing for us... You know what, I'm 
		just going to start from the 
		beginning... I have not been able 
		to express my gratefulness to 
		you... even as I look at the word 
		"grateful" now it doesn't begin to 
		tell you what I feel for you... 

	And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

				MELVIN
		Nice of you... thank you.

				CAROL
		Thank you.

				MELVIN
		Now I want you to do something for me.

	She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

				CAROL
		Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, 
		"what?" I thought I said, 
		"what?"... What?

				MELVIN
		I want you to go on this trip.

				CAROL
		No, sir... 

				MELVIN
		I can't do this alone. I'm afraid 
		he'll pull the stiff one eye on 
		me. I need you to chaperon. 
		Separate everything but cars. You 
		said you liked convertibles. Now 
		I'm on the hook.

				CAROL
		The stiff one eye?

				MELVIN
		Two days.

				CAROL
		I can't. I work.

				MELVIN
		You take off when you have to.

				CAROL
		My son.

				MELVIN
		Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

				CAROL
			(no other way)
		Melvin, I'd rather not.

				MELVIN
		What's that got to do with it?

				CAROL
		Funny, I thought it was a strong 
		point.

				MELVIN
		Write me a note and ain't she 
		sweet. I need a hand and where'd 
		she go.

				CAROL
		Are you saying accepting your help 
		obligates me!?

				MELVIN
		Is there another way to see it?

				CAROL
		No.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf 
	of the closet.

				CAROL
		Well, here's a little suitcase 
		shocked that it's been used.

	She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's 
	too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another 
	drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries 
	of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

	INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER

	Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday 
	"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it 
	back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

				CAROL
			(furiously exasperated)
		There's not way to pack for this 
		trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm 
		not packing the camera.

	As she exits the room --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	As she picks up the phone.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly 
	stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a 
	camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items -- 
	underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each 
	one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds 
	another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing 
	development. He has almost no recent experience with 
	receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little 
	comment to himself as he moves.

				MELVIN
		Woo-woo.

	He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is 
	-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but 
	before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his 
	throat.

	ON CAROL

	As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a 
	pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

				CAROL
		Hello?

				MELVIN
		Are you still coming?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	Melvin visibly relaxes.

				CAROL
		Melvin... I'd like to know exactly 
		where we are going.

				MELVIN
		Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. 
		So I know what you're going to ask 
		next.
			(correcting himself)
		That you might ask -- I'm not 
		certain.

				CAROL
		There's... there's no need to 
		bring anything dressy... or... I 
		mean -- I didn't know if we'd be 
		eating at any restaurant that 
		have dress codes.

				MELVIN
		Oh.
			(a beat)
		We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

				CAROL
		Okay, gotcha. What did you think 
		I was going to ask?

				MELVIN
		Whether crabs are in season there 
		now... 

				CAROL
		Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good 
		night.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

				BEVERLY
		How was it talking to him?

				CAROL
		Stop treating this like I'm going 
		away with a man. He's just going 
		to say those crappy, sick, 
		complaining, angry things to me. 
		I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. 
		He's a freak show -- the worst 
		person I ever met.

				BEVERLY
		Well, maybe he has nice friends.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches. 
	She kisses them.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		You stand there and I'll wave to 
		you from the back window.

	As she boards the bus.

				BEVERLY
		Call me as soon as you're settled.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		I love you.

	The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them 
	open.

				CAROL
			(to bus driver)
		Sensitive, huh?!

	The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at 
	his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing 
	himself.

	INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

	A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as 
	Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

	On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black 
	dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

				VETERINARIAN
		Anything unusual in the dog's 
		diet?

				MELVIN
		No. Everybody gets their own 
		cage?

				VETERINARIAN
		Certainly.

				MELVIN
			(pointing to 
			Chihuahua)
		Put him in with that one, not that 
		one... 
			(pointing to large 
			dog)
		... Builds his confidence.

	EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	Carol disembarks.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	As she walks and turns a corner.

	CLOSE ON CAROL

	The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death 
	chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do 
	not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws" 
	will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect 
	couldn't be grimmer.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the 
	tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the 
	building.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry that I'm not taking 
		you.

				SIMON
			(upset)
		So am I, Frank.

	Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

				MELVIN
		Soak it up -- it's your last 
		chance at a hug for a few days.

	As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor 
	changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

				CAROL
		Hi.

				MELVIN
		Thanks for being on time... Carol, 
		the waitress, this is Simon, the 
		fag.

				CAROL
		Hello... Oh, my God, who did that 
		to you?

				SIMON
		I, uh... I was... attacked. 
		Walked in on people robbing me. I 
		was hospitalized. I almost died.

				MELVIN
		Let's do the small talk in the 
		car. Load up.

	Carol puts her bag in the car.

				MELVIN
		I was going to do that for you.

				CAROL
			(taken aback)
		It's okay. No problem. Where 
		should we sit?

				MELVIN
			(totally non-plussed)
		I -- uh, I... Well, there is no 
		place cards or anything.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me go in back. You look like 
		you need all the room you can 
		manage.

				SIMON
		That's very thoughtful.

				MELVIN
		Never a break. Never.

	Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's 
	not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small 
	back seat. She struggles to get her feet in. 

				MELVIN
		You're really jammed back there.

	He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his 
	seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving 
	Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel. 
	She is startled by the gesture.

				CAROL
		Thanks, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		Welcome.

	And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

	EXT. 12TH STREET

	Turning onto Fifth.

				MELVIN
		I got the whole ride programmed.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all 
	carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the 
	one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly 
	and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick 
	burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

				MELVIN
		Just wanted to see what you'd do. 
		No, we have greatness here.

	He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS 
	UP."

	The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY 
	SELECTED MUSIC.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		Hey, I like this music.

	And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	The three of them... Carol chattering away.

				CAROL
		I don't know the last time I've 
		been out of the city... Hey, my 
		arms are tanning. I used to tan 
		great. We gotta stop soon so'se 
		I can check on Spencer.

				SIMON
			(during the above)
		I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I 
		can't turn my head all the way 
		yet... tell her we can't hear her.

				MELVIN
		Doesn't matter. She's enjoying 
		herself. Consider it part of the 
		music.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	A short time later. Carol is now driving.

				CAROL
		I'm sure, Simon, they did 
		something real off for you to feel 
		this way... But when it comes to 
		your partners -- or your kid -- 
		things will always be off for you 
		unless you set it straight. Maybe 
		this thing happened to you just to 
		give you that chance.

				MELVIN
		Nonsense!

				CAROL
		Anybody here who's interested in 
		what Melvin has to say raise their 
		hands.

	Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus 
	declared their majority.

				SIMON
		Do you want to know what happened 
		with my parents?

				CAROL
		Yes. I really would.

				SIMON
		Well... 

				CAROL
		No, let me pull over so I can pay 
		full attention.

	Car pulling over toward parking spot.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY

	She takes the car curbside and parks.

				CAROL
		Now go ahead.

	Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks 
	innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something 
	-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

				SIMON
		Well, I always painted. Always. 
		And my mother always encouraged 
		it. She was sort of fabulous 
		about it actually... and she used 
		to... I was too young to think 
		there was anything at all wrong 
		with it... and she was very 
		natural. She used to pose nude 
		for me... and I thought or assumed 
		my father was aware of it.

				MELVIN
		This stuff is pointless.

				CAROL
		Hey -- you let him... 

				MELVIN
		You like sad stories -- you want 
		mine.

				CARL
		. Go ahead, Simon. Really. 
		Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

				SIMON
		Okay. Well, one day my father 
		came in on one of those painting 
		sessions when I was nine -- and he 
		just started screaming at her -- 
		at us -- at evil. And... 

				MELVIN
			(very quickly)
		... my father didn't leave his 
		room for 11 years -- he hit my 
		hand with a yardstick if I made a 
		mistake on the piano.

				CAROL
		Go ahead, Simon. Your father 
		walked in on you and was yelling 
		and... really, come on.

				SIMON
		I was trying to defend my mother 
		and make peace, in the lamest way. 
		I said, "she's not naked -- it's 
		art." And then he started hitting 
		me. And he beat me unconscious. 
		After that he talked to me less 
		and less -- he knew before I left 
		for college, my dad came into my 
		room. He held out his hand. It 
		was filled with money. A big wad 
		of sweaty money.
			(gathers himself)
		And he said to me, "I don't want 
		you to ever come back." I grabbed 
		him and I hugged him... He turns 
		and walked out.

	Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as 
	strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so 
	much more complicated than her meat and potatoes 
	troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her 
	fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, 
	understated, gesture of friendship.

				CAROL
		Well, you know -- I still stay 
		what I said. You've got to get 
		past it all when it comes to your 
		parents. We all have these horror 
		stories to get over.

	Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

				MELVIN
		That's not true. Some of us have 
		great stories... pretty stories 
		that take place at lakes with 
		boats and friends and noodle 
		salad. Just not anybody in this 
		car. But lots of people -- that's 
		their story -- good times and 
		noodle salad... and that's what 
		makes it hard. Not that you had 
		it bad but being that pissed that 
		so many had it good.

				CAROL
		No.

				SIMON
		Not it at all, really.

				MELVIN
			(a veteran's irony)
		Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to 
		the hotel. And if you're lucky 
		tomorrow Dad will give you another 
		wad of sweaty money.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY

				MELVIN
		Two bedrooms and the sofa opens... 

	Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		No answer... Maybe we should just 
		drive there tomorrow. Can I have 
		that one?

				MELVIN
		Yes... sure.
			(to Simon)
		I'll take the sofa.

	Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever 
	have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials... 

				CAROL
			(into phone)
		Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are 
		you out of breath? You did?!? 
		That is great... So great... So -- 
		no, wait a second, Spence... 

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially 
	neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

				MELVIN
		Can I ask you a personal question?

	Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

				MELVIN
		Do you ever get an erection for a 
		woman?

				SIMON
		Melvin... 

				MELVIN
		Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier 
		if you were not... 

				SIMON
		You consider your life easy.

				MELVIN
		I give you that one... 
			(eyes suitcase)
		Nice packing.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting 
	there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new 
	factors in her life.

				CAROL
		My son was outside playing soccer. 
		I never saw him playing ball. Come 
		on, you guys -- take me out for a 
		good time... Take me out dancing.

				MELVIN
		Dancing?

				SIMON
		I can't, I'm exhausted.

	Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is 
	visibly disturbed by her gesture.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		I don't blame you... This is a 
		monumental first day out... You 
		sad or anything?

				SIMON
		No... Nervous. It would be very 
		rough, Carol, if you weren't 
		along.

				CAROL
		What a nice compliment.

	She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy. 
	She turns to him.

				CAROL
		I'm happy. And you're my date. 
		Let's get dressed.

	She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

				MELVIN
		I'm going to jump in the shower. 
		I'll be right with you.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main 
	room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she 
	sits down to wait -- through... 

	SERIES OF DISSOLVES

	Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until 
	finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom 
	through a cloud of steam. They exit.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they drive up.

				VALET
		Good evening, sir.

				MELVIN
		They sell hard shell crabs here?

				VALET
		Yes.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they enters... 

				HEAD WAITER
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		Hi. You have hard shells, right?

				CAROL
		Stop asking everyone.

				MELVIN
		Just him and that's it. Okay, you 
		can answer -- we've worked it out.

				HEAD WAITER
		Yes, we do... And I can give you a 
		tie and jacket.

				MELVIN
		What?

				HEAD WAITER
		They require a tie and jacket but 
		we have some available.

	He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

				MELVIN
		No... I'm not wearing that -- and 
		just in case you were going to ask 
		I'm not going to let you inject me 
		with plaque either.

				CAROL
		You promised a nice place -- can't 
		you just... 
			(to Head Waiter)
		You have these dry cleaned all the 
		time, don't you?

				HEAD WAITER
		Actually, I don't think so.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Wait here.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

	EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

	As the car goes right across the street to a shopping 
	mall.

	INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT

	Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

				SALESMAN
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		I need a coat and tie.

	OTHER ANGLE

	CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so 
	that passage for Melvin is impossible.

				SALESMAN
		Come on in.

				MELVIN
		No.

				SALESMAN
		No?

				MELVIN
			(pointing)
		That jacket and give me a tie.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

				VALET #2
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		You have hard shells?

				VALET #2
		I'm not sure.

				MELVIN
		Everyone else says you do.

				VALET #2
		Then I guess we do.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

	As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is 
	having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool -- 
	watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning 
	down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin 
	watches... Watches his date.

				HEAD WAITER
		Shall I get her for you?

				MELVIN
		No, it's all right. I'll just 
		watch.

	He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns 
	-- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture... 
	and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has 
	lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her. 
	She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, 
	giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g. 
	She notices the waiter in her trail.

				CAROL
			(mouthing the words 
			to Melvin)
		My drink is following me.

	Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite. 
	He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

				CAROL
		You look s... 

	She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then... 

				CAROL
		You look great.

	They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

				CAROL
		You wanna dance?

				MELVIN
		I've been thinking about that 
		since you brought it up before.

				CAROL
			(rising)
		And?

				MELVIN
		No... 
			(and before she can 
			digest that)
		... I don't get this place. They 
		make me buy an outfit but they let 
		you wear a house dress. I don't 
		get it.

	ON CAROL

	Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in 
	extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.

				MELVIN
		No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't 
		mean it. You gotta sit down. You 
		can still give me the dirty 
		look... just sit down and give it 
		to me.

				CAROL
		Melvin, pay me a compliment... I 
		need one and quick... You have no 
		idea how much what you said just 
		hurt my feelings.

				MELVIN
			(really pissed, 
			mutters)
		That monominute somebody gets that 
		you need them they threaten to go 
		away. Never fails.

				CAROL
		That's not compliment, Melvin... 
		That's just trying to sound smart 
		so I feel stupid... A compliment 
		is something nice about somebody 
		else... Now or never.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

	He waves her down.

				CAROL
			(sitting)
		And mean it... 

				MELVIN
		Can we order first?

	She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. 
	This does not stop Melvin.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Two crab dinners and pitcher of 
		cold beer.
			(to Carol)
		Baked or fries?

				CAROL
		Fries.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		One baked -- one fries.

				STARTLED WAITER
			(shouting back)
		I'll tell your waiter.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Okay, I got a real great 
		compliment for you and it's true.

				CAROL
		I am so afraid you're about to say 
		something awful... 

				MELVIN
		Don't be pessimistic. It's not 
		your style. Okay... Here I 
		goes... Clearly a mistake.
			(this is hell 
			for him)
		I have this -- what? Ailment... 
		And my doctor -- a shrink... who 
		I used to see all the time... he 
		says 50 or 60 percent of the time 
		a pill can really help. I hate 
		pills. Very dangerous things, 
		pills. "Hate," I am using the 
		word "hate" about pills. My 
		compliment is that when you came 
		to my house that time and told me 
		how you'd never -- well, you were 
		there, you know... The next 
		morning I started taking these 
		pills.

				CAROL
			(a little confused)
		I don't quite get how that's a 
		compliment for me.

	Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- 
	so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- 
	then:

				MELVIN
		You make me want to be a better 
		man.

	Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so 
	slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered, 
	momentarily moved and his for the taking.

				CAROL
		That's maybe the best compliment 
		of my life.

				MELVIN
		Then I've really overshot here 
		'cause I was aiming at just enough 
		to keep you from walking out.

	Carol laughs.

				CAROL
		So how are you doing with those 
		pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

				MELVIN
		Takes months to know... They work 
		little by little.
			(holds his head; 
			then)
		Talking like this is exhausting.

	Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very 
	close -- he tenses.

				CAROL
		Have you ever let a romantic 
		moment make you do something you 
		know is stupid?

				MELVIN
		Never.

				CAROL
		Here's the trouble with never.

	TIGHT SHOT

	for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at 
	him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him 
	-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves 
	away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But 
	now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is 
	brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. 
	Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

				MELVIN
		You don't owe me that.

				CAROL
		That wasn't payment. When you 
		first came into breakfast, when I 
		saw you -- I thought you were 
		handsome... Then, of course, you 
		spoke... So now that your soft 
		li'l underbelly is all exposed. 
		Tell me, why did you bring me?

	Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... 
	as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

				MELVIN
		Well, ah... that's a personal 
		question.

				CAROL
		Tell me even if you're scared. 
		Tell me why you wanted me here. 
		It's okay.

	She kisses him again.

				CAROL
		If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

				MELVIN
			(dissembling)
		There are lots of reason... I had 
		a thought that if you had sex with 
		Simon it might... 

				CAROL
			(humiliated)
		Sex with Simon?

				MELVIN
		It's one idea... 

				CAROL
		That's why you brought me? Look 
		at me! Is that really why you 
		brought me... Like I'm a what and 
		I owe you what?!

				MELVIN
		I don't know why I brought you -- 
		that idea occurred to me is all... 
		It came out first... Hey, you kiss 
		him -- me... He says he loves 
		you. You two hit it off. But you 
		don't want to... fine... Forget 
		what I said about sex with Simon. 
		It was a mistake.

				CAROL
			(wiping away tears)
		I'll never forget you said it.

				MELVIN
		It was a mistake.

	But she has already turned away and exits the 
	restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.

	INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not 
	breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let 
	the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice, 
	then a humorless male voice:

				PARENTS' VOICE
			(humorless male 
			voice)
		Hi. This is Fred Bishop... 
			(perky woman's 
			voice)
		... and Betty.
			(Fred again)
		We are sorry to be unable to take 
		your call right now. Please leave 
		a message and we'd appreciate your 
		including the time/date and 
		purpose of your call.
			(Simon mouths the 
			word "date," then 
			Betty speaks before 
			the beep Bye-bye.

				SIMON
		Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in 
		town... 
			(he waits)
		... and, folks, you haven't come 
		home later than 10 in your lives. 
		Please pick up -- really... 
		Okay... I'm going to call again in 
		the morning. I need to see you. 
		Or, at least get you to answer the 
		phone.

	He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he 
	needs help.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she 
	goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing 
	things in.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT

				SIMON
		Hello... Hello???

	Carol thrusts open the door and enters... 

				SIMON
		Was this supposed to be your room?

				CAROL
		Our room. I don't want to see him 
		and he's not going to come 
		knocking on your door.

	Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, 
	inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

				SIMON
		Can you not be violent?

				CAROL
		I don't think so. You need help 
		with the pants?

				SIMON
			(emphatically)
		No!!!

				CAROL
		I'm going to take a big bath and 
		order a big meal.

				SIMON
		Uh-huh... 

				CAROL
		I'm sorry... are you okay?

				SIMON
		Well, considering everything's 
		horrible and tomorrow I have to 
		face my parents... Don't ask me
		... I'm sick of my own complaints
		... got to get me a new set of 
		thoughts.

				CAROL
		Why? What have you been thinking 
		about?

				SIMON
		How to die, mostly.

				CAROL
		Can you believe in our little mix 
		you're the good roommate.

	Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins 
	to prepare a bath.

				SIMON
			(turning off the light)
		Good night.

				CAROL
		Good night.

	We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or 
	sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he 
	faces the bathroom and we have... 

	SIMON'S POV

	Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now 
	as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair 
	-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast 
	exposed... 

	BACK TO SCENE

				SIMON
			(a whisper)
		Hold it.

	He leaves the bed.

	ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

	What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set 
	and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair 
	and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of 
	the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

				SIMON
		I've got to sketch you.

				CAROL
		No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer 
		than you think. I give the wrong 
		impression sometimes and... 

				SIMON
		I haven't even been thinking about 
		sketching for weeks.

				CAROL
		Stop staring. Do a vase.

				SIMON
		But you're beautiful... your skin 
		glows.

				CAROL
		Thanks. But I just want to take a 
		bath and... 

				SIMON
		That long neck -- the line of 
		you... you're porcelain... your 
		back goes on forever. You're 
		classic... you're why cavemen 
		chiseled on walls... 

				CAROL
		All right, cut me a break.

	Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him 
	earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly 
	but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right. 
	She's breathtaking.

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to 
	the bartender.

				MELVIN
		So then, the next thing I know, 
		she's sitting right next to me, 
		and then, well, it's not right to 
		go into the details, but I screwed 
		up. I got nervous. I said the 
		wrong thing and if I hadn't, I 
		could be in bed now with a woman 
		who if you could make her smile 
		you got a life. Instead, I'm here 
		with you, no offense, a moron 
		pushing the last legal drug.

	He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his 
	heart breaking.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT

	He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		I don't care how you put it -- 
		We're being naughty here, pal.

	FULL SHOT

	Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a 
	ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His 
	style cramped by his cast.

				SIMON
		No. No. This is great, this is 
		so great. I can't get the angle 
		with this cast.

	He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle 
	no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece 
	from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- 
	a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

	The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better 
	than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

				MELVIN
		Did you have sex with her?

	Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the 
	hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.

				MELVIN
		Sorry, didn't realize she was 
		right there.
			(a beat)
		Did you have sex with her?

				CAROL
		To hell with sex.

	Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

				CAROL
		We held each other. It was better 
		than sex. What I need he gave me 
		great.

				SIMON
		I just love her.
			(beat)
		How're you doing?

	Melvin reacts.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

	Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

				SIMON
		Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely 
		hear you. Do you have to whisper? 
		No -- don't apologize -- it was 
		the luckiest thing for all of us 
		that you didn't answer last 
		night... I can't hear you... okay, 
		dear, just listen to me then.

	ON MELVIN AND CAROL

	Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings 
	the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in 
	her suitcase.

				MELVIN
		I get why you're angry. It's no 
		snap to explain why I was like 
		that, but let's not try to do it 
		on the run... 

				SIMON
		... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- 
		truly. A little odd that you 
		didn't come to see me when you 
		heard I was hurt, but the 
		important thing I want you to know 
		is your son is happy. I'm working 
		again. I'll make do -- I don't 
		want a thing. Wouldn't take it if 
		it was offered. I'll drop you a 
		note from wherever I land and then 
		it's up to you. I hope we patch 
		things up but know that if we 
		don't, I wish you both the very 
		best... I can't hear you. You 
		heard me, though, right? Good -- 
		take good care. 'Bye.

	He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over 
	to Carol and Melvin.

				MELVIN
		... Now he's going to want to 
		stay. And they'll want to take a 
		ride to the lake or whatever. So 
		it's a good five hours back. It 
		gives us a chance to take it easy 
		and... 

				SIMON
		I'm going back with you.

				CAROL
		But what about... 

				SIMON
		I'll take care of myself --

				MELVIN
		What are you talking about? You 
		got real problems.

				SIMON
		I know. I'm a little bit nervous. 
		Suddenly everything seems so easy. 
		Carol, a load has been lifted.

				CAROL
		One night with me!

				SIMON
		You think you're kidding.

	Melvin stalks out.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The car parked near a phone booth --

				MELVIN
			(to Frank over 
			the phone)
		Aww Jesus! No choice.

	Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

				CAROL
		I got a gift for you.

	She hands him a base ball cap.

				MELVIN
			(on phone)
		Nothing like no choice to make you 
		feel at home.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

				MELVIN
		Do it then. Get the dog picked 
		up. I can't believe you let it 
		stay there.

	Melvin hangs up the phone.

				MELVIN
		Good-bye.
			(to Simon)
		Well, your luck is holding. They 
		sublet your place. You're 
		homeless. Frank's got a line on 
		another place you can use for now.

				SIMON
		Another place where?

				MELVIN
		Does it matter?

	Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a 
	special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it 
	PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

				CAROL
		I don't want to hear that music 
		right now.

				MELVIN
		What do you mean? You said you 
		liked it.

				CAROL
		I don't.

				MELVIN
		This one has a special meaning.

				CAROL
		It's your car but I don't want to 
		hear it. If that means anything.

	Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
	proclamation of love.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

	As the car arrives... They get out... 

				MELVIN
		Here are the keys to my apartment. 
		I'm going to park you in my place 
		while I take Carol home.

				CAROL
			(hefting bag)
		I'll take a bus.

				MELVIN
		I'll take you... why not?

				CAROL
		I don't care what you did for me. 
		I don't think I want to know you 
		anymore -- all you do is make me 
		feel badly about myself.
			(turning to Simon)
		You have my number.

				SIMON
			(hugging her)
		I love you... 
			(sotto)
		Let him take you home.

				CAROL
		Don't want to. I love you.

	She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at 
	Melvin with some sympathy.

				MELVIN
		Don't say anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Where Verdell's ears prick.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As they enter.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I told you to go on in.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Look, I've got to get a hold of 
		Frank and see where I'm hanging my 
		hat 'cause... 

	The door opens, revealing them:

				MELVIN
		I think you gotta camp it here... 

				SIMON
		What are you talking about?

	The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the 
	dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		I know the feeling -- you feel 
		like your ol' self again, huh? --
		Mommy and Daddy are home.

	Melvin reacts.

				SIMON
		Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
	
	Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

				MELVIN
		They took your place furnished. 
		Jackie said she grabbed your 
		personal stuff -- they were 
		supposed to set you up here.
			(leading the way)
		There's this extra room -- I 
		never use. It gets good light. 
		No other answer really.

	Simon follows.

	INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

	As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small 
	but lovely garret.

				SIMON
		Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm 
		me.

				MELVIN
		They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

				SIMON
		I love you.

	Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

				MELVIN
		I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the 
		luckiest guy alive if that did it 
		for me.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and 
	Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each 
	around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully 
	dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we 
	hear Simon's whispered voice.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Where is my big hairy boy?

	Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest 
	approaches.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Verdell, sweeties?

	Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

				SIMON
		Sorry, didn't know you were awake. 
		I just thought Verdell shouldn't 
		get too used to sleeping in here 
		'cause then... 

				MELVIN
		Look, we both want the dog -- 
		and... 

	The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin 
	doesn't move.

				SIMON
		Should I get it?

	Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several 
	beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Hello.

	ON SIMON

				SIMON
			(into phone)
		Hello. It's me. He took me in. 
		Did you know? Hold on, I'll get 
		him for you.

	He walks back to Melvin's room.

	INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As he enters.

				SIMON
		It's Carol.

	Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one 
	mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.

				MELVIN
		Here. Take the dog.

	As he speeds him out... 

				SIMON
		Good luck.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat 
	loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin 
	-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat 
	clearing.

				MELVIN
		Hello.

				CAROL
		Yeah... Well... 

				MELVIN
			(very concerned)
		How you doing?

				CAROL
		I can trust my brain.

				MELVIN
		That seems like a good choice.

				CAROL
		I don't know whether I'm being 
		sensible or hard on you.

				MELVIN
		The two might go together.

				CAROL
		See. There's an example. I don't 
		know whether you're being cute or 
		crazy now.

				MELVIN
			(what the hell)
		Cute.

				CAROL
		You don't have to answer 
		everything I say. Just listen to 
		me. Okay?

	He nods his head, "yes."

				CAROL
		It's really something that you're 
		looking after Simon. And what I 
		said on the street. That was a 
		bad thing to say. And it made me 
		sick to my stomach. It was a bad 
		thing to say. And I'd be lying if 
		I didn't say that I enjoyed your 
		company... but the truth is you do 
		bother me enormously and I know -- 
		think -- that it's best for me to 
		not have contact with you because 
		you're just not ready and you're a 
		pretty old guy to not be ready... 
		and I'm too old to ignore that. 
		But there were extraordinary 
		kindnesses that did take place. 
		So thanks for the trips... 

	She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than 
	ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

				MELVIN
		Okay to say something now?

				CAROL
		Go ahead.

				MELVIN
		I should've danced with you.

				CAROL
		Okay. Good-bye.

				MELVIN
		So long.

	Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped. 
	Oh, hell... she missed him.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He 
	is impatient.

				MELVIN
		You going to come talk to me or 
		not?

				SIMON
		I'm coming.

	We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be 
	allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

				SIMON
		What did she say?

				MELVIN
		I'm a great guy -- 
		"extraordinary"... 
			(before Simon can 
			celebrate)
		... and she doesn't want contact 
		with me.
			(a beat)
		I'm dying here.

				SIMON
		Because... 
			(gently)
		... you love her?

				MELVIN
			(sharply)
		No... and you're supposed to be 
		sensitive and sharp.

				SIMON
		Okay... you tell me why --
			(mimics him)
		"You're dying here."

				MELVIN
		I don't know... Let me sleep on it 
		and figure it out.
			(then)
		Because I'm stuck! Can't go back 
		to what I had... She's evicted me 
		from my life.

				SIMON
		Did you like it that much?

				MELVIN
			(furiously)
		It was better than this... Look, 
		you, I'm very intelligent. If 
		you're going to give me advice or 
		conversation or consolation or 
		hope, you got to be better than 
		you're doing. If you can't be at 
		least momentarily interesting than 
		shut the hell up. I'm drowning 
		and you're describing water.

				SIMON
			(getting pissed)
		Picking on me won't help.

				MELVIN
		Well, if that's true then I'm 
		really in trouble.

				SIMON
		But you know where you're lucky?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely not.

				SIMON
		You know who you want. I'll take 
		your seat any day. So do 
		something... don't sleep on it... 
		go over there. I don't think 
		anybody should ever sleep on 
		anything -- it's not always good 
		to let things calm down.

				MELVIN
		Hey... I'm charged here. But she 
		might kill me for showing up this 
		late.

				SIMON
		Then get in your jammies and I'll 
		read you a story... I think you've 
		got a chance. The only real enemy 
		you have is her ability to think 
		logically -- the best thing you 
		have going for you is your 
		willingness to humiliate yourself 
		if it gives you one chance in 
		whatever -- so go catch her off-
		guard.

				MELVIN
		Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

	He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				MELVIN
		I forgot to lock the door.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - 
	NIGHT

	As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at 
	his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the 
	apartment house.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great 
	uncertainty.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting 
	directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading 
	one of Melvin's books... 

	There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL... 
	someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly 
	-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL -- 
	until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to 
	her wide open window and looks over.

	HER POV

	The convertible at the curb.

	BACK TO SCENE

	She hesitates --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the 
	sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. 
	He bolts for the door and enters.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN 
	SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

				CAROL
		What do you want, Melvin?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What do you want?

				MELVIN
		'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm 
		sorry. And you could be grouchy.

				CAROL
		Grouchy?

				MELVIN
		... 'Cause of being woken up, and 
		it would make my job impossible. 
		So then I wouldn't even try.

				CAROL
		What job?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Beverly in the hallway looking on --

	BACK TO SCENE

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry I woke you -- some other 
		time.

	He half turns to leave.

				CAROL
		I wasn't asleep!!

				MELVIN
		What a break... 

				CAROL
			(losing it a bit)
		Is it a secret what you're doing 
		here?

				MELVIN
		I had to see you... 

				CAROL
		Because... 

				MELVIN
		It relaxes me... I'd feel better 
		just sitting on the curb in front 
		of your house than anyplace else 
		I can think of or imagine.

	Carol has not ever heard anything like that before... 
	it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her 
	door down the hallway, has heard at least this last 
	part... 

	Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... 

				MELVIN
			(serious)
		Wait a minute, I'm overstating 
		here, maybe the inside stairs. I 
		don't want to sit with my feet in 
		the gutter. What does that serve? 
		It only... 

	But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

				CAROL
		Stop it!! Why can't I have a 
		normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out 
		of here. Just a regular boyfriend 
		who doesn't go nuts on me... 

				BEVERLY
			(butting in)
		Everybody wants that, dear -- it 
		doesn't exit... 
			(as Carol turns 
			to her)
		Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

	She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh -- 
	gathers herself. A beat.

				MELVIN
			(hopefully)
		Boyfriend?

				CAROL
		Oh, come on in and try not to ruin 
		everything by being you.

				MELVIN
		Maybe we could live without the 
		wise cracks.

	She looks at him -- then:

				CAROL
		Maybe we could... 

	Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen 
	linoleum and stalls at the door.

				MELVIN
		It feels a little confined here. 
		Let's take a walk.

				CAROL
		See. It's four in the morning. A 
		walk sounds a little screwy to me, 
		if you don't mind.

				MELVIN
		If you need an excuse, there's a 
		bakery on the corner. There's a 
		shot it'll open soon -- that way 
		we're not screwy -- we're just 
		two people who like warm rolls.

				CAROL
		Okay.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

	They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual 
	attention to where he steps.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- 
	it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids 
	stepping on the lines.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing 
	down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious 
	-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

				CAROL
			(gently; almost 
			lovingly)
		I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever 
		this is -- is not going to work.

	ON MELVIN

	He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper 
	something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his 
	history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

				MELVIN
		I'm feeling... I've been feeling 
		better.

				CAROL
		Melvin, even though it may seem 
		that way now -- you don't know me 
		all that well... 
			(as he scoffs)
		I'm not the answer for you.

	She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns 
	back to him.

				MELVIN
		Hey, I've got a great compliment 
		for you.

				CAROL
		You know what? I... 

				MELVIN
		Just let me talk.
			(gathers himself 
			with uncertainty, 
			then:)
		I'm the only one on the face of 
		the earth who realizes that you're 
		the greatest woman on earth. I'm 
		the only one who appreciates how 
		amazing you are in every single 
		thing you do -- in every single 
		thought you have... in how you 
		are with Spencer -- Spence... 
			(he has reached 
			her)
		... in how you say what you mean 
		and how you almost always mean 
		something that's all about being 
		straight and good... 

	ON CAROL

	She stands on the precipice of being transported away 
	from the logic which has been her lifeline.

				MELVIN
		I think most people miss that 
		about you and I watch wondering 
		how they can watch you bring them 
		food and clear their dishes and 
		never get that they have just met 
		the greatest woman alive... And 
		the fact that I get it makes me 
		feel great... about me!
			(a real question 
			filled with 
			concern for her)
		You got a real good reason to walk 
		out on that?

	That last question clearly a true question, not the least 
	rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

				CAROL
		No! It's certainly not. No -- I 
		don't think so. No.

				MELVIN
			(tentatively)
		I'm gonna grab you.
			(with conviction)
		I didn't mean it to be a question. 
		I'm gonna grab you.

	He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. 
	A tense beat. Then:

				MELVIN
		I know I can do better.

	They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A 
	first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot 
	land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his 
	knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a 
	notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in 
	unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a 
	path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the 
	bakery turn on as it opens for business.

				CAROL
		Warm rolls... 

	They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As 
	they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to 
	clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto 
	a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous 
	fact and joins Carol inside as we:

	FADE IN:

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an 
	enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up 
	against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the 
	unseen love of her long life.

			SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I'm just going to get some 
		flowers, dear. I'll be back in 
		twenty minutes. It's tulip season 
		today. I'm so happy.

	And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness 
	dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that 
	quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her 
	apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

	POV - MELVIN UDALL

	in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved, 
	unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever 
	met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength 
	is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the 
	elevator door he holds open.

			MELVIN
		Come here, sweetheart... come on.

	ON DOG

	Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. 
	Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the 
	mutt who has ignores him.

			MELVIN
		Wanna go for a ride? Okay, 
		sweetie?

	The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges 
	and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog 
	urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG 
	sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

			MELVIN
			(a malevolent tone)
		You've pissed your last floor, you 
		dog-eared monkey.

	The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much 
	meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout 
	shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the 
	garbage chute.
				
			MELVIN
		I'll bet you wish you were some 
		sort of real dog now, huh? Don't 
		worry...  this is New York. If you 
		can make it here, you can make it 
		anywhere, you know? You ugly, 
		smelly fuck.

	And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and 
	lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS" 
	from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment 
	door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON 
	NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with 
	Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of 
	trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

	Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about 
	to enter his apartment.

			SIMON
		Verdell!?!! Here, good doggie... 

	He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.
			
			SIMON
		Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey 
		there!
			(as Melvin turns)
		Have you seen Verdell?

			MELVIN
		What's he look like?

	Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is 
	directly opposite Simon's.

			SIMON
		My dog... you know... I mean my 
		little dog with the adorable 
		face... Don't you know what my dog 
		looks like?

			MELVIN
		I got it. You're talking about 
		your dog. I thought that was the 
		name of the colored man I've been 
		seeing in the hall.

	Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

			SIMON
		Which color was that?

			MELVIN
		Like thick molasses, with one of 
		those wide noses perfect for 
		smelling trouble and prison 
		food... 

	Simon has had it.

			SIMON
		Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.

			MELVIN
			(not missing a beat)
		How're you doing?

				SIMON
		Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I 
		think you know that.

				FRANK
			(overlapping)
		Simon, you've got to get dressed.

				MELVIN
			(to Simon)
		What I know is that as long as you 
		keep your work zipped up around 
		me, I don't give a fuck what or 
		where you shove your show. Are we 
		being neighbors for now?

				SIMON
			(to Frank)
		Do you still think I was 
		exaggerating?

	FRANK can only smile.

				FRANK
		Definitely a package you don't 
		want to open or touch.

				MELVIN
		Hope you find him. I love that 
		dog.

	Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds 
	himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

				SIMON
			(directly)
		You don't love anything, Mr. 
		Udall.

	Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the 
	hallway.

				MELVIN
		I love throwing your dog down the 
		garbage chute.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to 
	five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and 
	off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards 
	his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens 
	the medicine chest.

	INT. MEDICINE CHEST

	Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps 
	one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the 
	process two more times.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

	A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN 
	holding Verdell who looks and finds:

	SIMON

	who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves 
	quickly toward the group and his dog.

				SIMON
		Thank the good Lord... wow... my 
		honey... where have you been?

				PARTY GOER
			(thinking the greeting's 
			for him)
		He always liked me.

	As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the 
	Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a 
	laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As 
	the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside. 
	Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks 
	some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts 
	Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS 
	in protest.

				SIMON
		Just for a second, okay?

	The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

				SIMON
			(kissing him on the mouth)
		Look at him...  where was little 
		baby?

				HANDYMAN
			(smiling)
		In the basement garbage bin eating 
		diaper shit.

	Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in 
	cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

				SIMON
		Go ahead, John, you earned your fun.
			(looking at Verdell)
		How did he get down in the 
		basement? I mean even if he got 
		on the elevator how... ?

				HANDYMAN
		Maybe some nice neighbor shoved 
		him down the garbage chute.

				SIMON
		My God! No!

	He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

	Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he 
	writes.

				MELVIN
		'Somewhat in the dark, she had 
		confessed and he had forgiven. 
		This is what you live for, he 
		said. Two heads on a pillow where 
		there is only the safety of being 
		with each other. How, she 
		wondered, could she find such hope 
		in the most shameful part of her.'

	He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall.

	But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

				MELVIN
		'At last she was able to define 
		love. Love was... '

	More KNOCKING.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you 
		please.

				MELVIN
		'Love was... '

	He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of 
	love -- but the knocking throws him.

				MELVIN
		... Son-of-a-bitch-pansy-assed-
		stool-pusher.

	He burst from his chair.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step 
	back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

				MELVIN
			(loud and angry)
		Yeeeess!!!

				SIMON
		Maybe this can wait.

	Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

				SIMON
		I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

				MELVIN
		Well, that's a load off.

	Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to 
	close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

				SIMON
		Did you... do something to him?

				MELVIN
		Do you realize that I work at 
		him?

				SIMON
			(eyes downcast)
		No, I didn't.

				MELVIN
		Do you like to be interrupt when 
		you are danging around in your 
		little garden?

				SIMON
		No...  actually, I even shut the 
		phone off and put a little piece 
		of cardboard in the ringer so no 
		one can just buzz me from d... 

				MELVIN
		Well, I work all the time. So 
		never, never again interrupt me. 
		Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 
		years from now... not if there's 
		fire. Not even if you hear a thud 
		from inside my home and a week 
		later there's a smell from in 
		there that can only come from a 
		decaying body and you have to hold 
		a hanky against your face because 
		the stench is so thick you think 
		you're going to faint even then 
		don't come knocking or, if it's 
		election night and you're excited 
		and want to celebrate because some 
		fudge-packer you dated has been 
		elected the first queer President 
		of the United States... and he's 
		going to put you up in Camp David 
		and you just want to share the 
		moment with someone...  don't knock
		...  not on this door. Not for 
		anything. Got me. Sweetheart?

				SIMON
		Yes. It's not a subtle point 
		you're making.

				MELVIN
		Okay, then.

	Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

				SIMON
		So the theory of confrontations is 
		that now he'll think twice before 
		messing with me?

	Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

				SIMON
		He's genuinely upsetting, isn't 
		he?

				FRANK
		Won't worry about it. You go 
		ahead.

	Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly 
	on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Oh, I'm pissed!! Now I am really 
		pissed!!!

	Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open. 
	Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him 
	forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

				MELVIN
		No touch. No touch. No touch.

				FRANK
		You may think you can intimidate 
		the whole world with your 
		attitude, but I grew up in Hell. 
		My grandmother had more attitude. 
		You don't intimidate me.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Police! Police! Fucking crooked 
		police...  doughnut-munching morons 
		help me!
			(to Frank)
		Assault and battery and you're 
		black.

				FRANK
		Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like 
		him enough to batter you 
		unrecognizable if you verbally 
		abuse him or so much as touch his 
		dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try 
		and think how you can make this up 
		to him.
			(suddenly loud)
		I hate doing this. I'm an art 
		dealer.
			(beat)
		Have a nice day. Party!

	He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens 
	his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as 
	he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears 
	impressed.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His 
	walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the 
	danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear. 
	At times he places his palms together and extends his 
	arms cutting a path through people. We will be very 
	pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	His eyes focused on the terrain.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	ANGLE ON WAITRESS

	CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer. 
	You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be 
	the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a 
	story about her son for the umpteenth time.

				CAROL
			(to the Mother's 
			little girl)
		Look at you, you're all better.

				MOTHER
		It's that new medication.

				CAROL
		You know all my son's stuff, 
		right?

	The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but 
	Carol interrupts her.

				CAROL
		No, no, no, I got a date tonight. 
		I'm walking out the door this 
		morning and he says to me, 'Mom, 
		I promise not to get one of my 
		fevers or coughs during your 
		date.'

				MOTHER
		Isn't that sweet.

				CAROL
		Little blonde angle.
			(to child, 
			affectionately)
		Eat everything.

	Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a 
	table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find 
	a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

				WOMAN
		It just came out of me. I said 
		you love me the way a remote 
		control loves a TV. As long as I 
		switch every time... 

				HER MALE COMPANION
		Wonderful.

				MELVIN
		People who talk in metaphors can 
		shampoo my crotch.
			(on their look)
		Eat up.

	They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the 
	waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL, 
	are talking.

				LISA
		Pay me back next week.

				CAROL
		I owe you. I told you today... 
		them's the rules. Oh, excuse me, 
		Melvin.

	She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out 
	of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else 
	ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

				MELVIN
		I'm starving.

				CAROL
			(firmly to Lisa)
		Will you please take it?

	Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with 
	stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out 
	of the way... 

				LISA
		This way you take a cab home so 
		you have time to get ready for the 
		date.

				CAROL
		"Ready" is not my problem.

	She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could 
	read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the 
	date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

				CAROL
			(to Melvin)
		Go sit down. You know you're not 
		allowed back here...  Spencer's 
		more excited about it than I am... 
		He says, "Mom, I promise not to 
		get a fever or couch during your date."

	The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go 
	"awww."

				CAROL
		I know. He's just the best.

				MELVIN
		I've got Jews at my table.

				CAROL
		It's not your table. It's the 
		place's table. Behave. This 
		once, you can sit at someone 
		else's station.

	The two waitresses signal their protests.

				CAROL
		Or you can just wait your turn... 

	Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs 
	near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo... 
	then:

				MELVIN
		How much more you got to eat? 
		Your appetite isn't as big as 
		your noses, is it?

				WOMAN
		What?!!

				MAN
			(to Woman)
		Let's go --

	The Woman starts to protest.

				MAN
		Let's leave. We're going.

	Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his 
	pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed. 
	As he opens his utensils.

				CAROL
		Bryan says he doesn't care how 
		long you've been coming you ever 
		act like this again you're barred 
		for life. I'm gonna miss the 
		excitement, but I'll handle it.

	There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some 
	ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only 
	one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear 
	the table.

				MELVIN
		The table's fine if it had some 
		cholesterol on it. Two sausages, 
		six bacon strips, fries, three 
		eggs over easy and coffee.

				CAROL
		You're gonna die soon with that 
		diet, you know that?

				MELVIN
		We're all gonna die soon. I will. 
		You will. It sure sounds like 
		your son will.

	ON CAROL

	Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her 
	perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin 
	senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

				CAROL
		If you ever mention my son again, 
		you will never be able to eat here 
		again. Do you understand? Give me 
		some sign you understand or leave 
		now. Do you understand me... 
			(adds truthful label)
		you crazy freak? Do you?!?

	A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing 
	down.

				CAROL
		Okay. I'll get your order.

	She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower 
	lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room 
	sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make 
	noises as she responds...  each time startling herself 
	with her own noise and trying to reign it in.

	She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway 
	-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the 
	emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young 
	Man stops and looks at her.

				YOUNG MAN
		What?

				CAROL
		I...  I...  I don't know...  You got 
		me.

	His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited 
	but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the 
	fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her 
	mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt 
	opening her mouth. She stops him.

				CAROL
		Let me just do whatever I do by 
		myself...  I'll catch up to you 
		someplace I promise.
			(as he's put off)
		Oh, no...  don't look like that. 
		No. I'm sorry if I'm a goof.

	And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed 
	the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about 
	egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when 
	we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and 
	COUGHING.

				CAROL
		Kissing...  kissing boys. Oh my.

	Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

				SPENCER (O.S.)
			(softly)
		Grandma, grandma... 

				YOUNG MAN
		Maybe you better check.

				CAROL
		Like what did you think I was 
		going to do?

	INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway... 
	she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her 
	mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones... 
	she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the 
	cough.

				BEVERLY
		I'm sorry. I was hearing just 
		everything you were doing so I put 
		these on to give you privacy.

	Carol now goes into her son's room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT

	The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... 
	two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer 
	(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand 
	filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with 
	some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged 
	into the tiny space.

				SPENCER
		I'm sorry.

				CAROL
		Don't be silly. How bad?

				SPENCER
		Not bad.

	Carol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs -- 
	trying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each 
	know what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as 
	he throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She 
	loves him.

	INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

				CAROL
			(a bit panicked)
		You can't smoke...  He can't take 
		smoke.

	He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand 
	squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his 
	hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he 
	picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking 
	at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to 
	cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

				CAROL
		Oh, God...  I don't even notice 
		anymore.

	She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make 
	light.

				CAROL
		That'll teach you.

				YOUNG MAN
		Don't apologize.

				CAROL
			(perturbed)
		That wasn't an apology.

	She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her -- 
	how uncomfortable he is.

				CAROL
		Hey...  this is just a little throw-
		up -- it's nothing to be so 
		embarrassed about. Really.
			(as he shifts 
			uncomfortably)
		Thanks for the dinner. Let me 
		write down which trains you take 
		to get back.

				YOUNG MAN
		No way.

	She brightens.

				YOUNG MAN
		I'll take a cab.

	She deflates as he moves past her.

				YOUNG MAN
		Too much reality for a Friday 
		night.

	EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

	A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the 
	approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN 
	and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and 
	the most likeable of the gritty little trio.

				EVAN
		Why is every customer surprised I 
		read books?

				DOUG
			(amazed)
		You read books?

				EVAN
		Oh, wow! I know this guy! Look! 
		He even bought me dinner.

	They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in 
	front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through 
	the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

				CARL
			(slightly exasperated)
		Look, I just can't. I promised 
		Simon I'd find him a model.

				FRIEND (V.O.)
			(on speaker phone,
			flirting)
		Carl, take me off the speaker. 
		Did I tell you that these are 
		house seats? C'mon, you could use 
		a break. Hello...  Carl, are you 
		there...  hello?

	Seeing the hustlers:

				CARL
.		...  I just found a model.

				DOUG
			(to Carl)
		Hey, how it's goin'... 

				EVAN
		Hey, hi...  remember?

				CARL
		I only need one.

				EVAN
		You picked me up, maybe a few 
		weeks, I don't know, some time 
		ago. You were very flattering 
		about our...  encounter.

				CARL
		Maybe just you and me...  but this 
		is for a painting. I need a 
		pretty face.

	Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal 
	his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer. 
	He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace 
	humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who 
	scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Sorry, I was out in the studio 
		doing some work and I forgot about 
		our appointment.

	He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away 
	-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him 
	and eyeing the expensive apartment.

				SIMON
		I usually make such a big deal out 
		of picking models but Carl's so 
		thorough. I'll bet he drove you 
		nuts checking your references.

	And he turns and sees the naked model.

				SIMON
			(taken aback)
		This isn't a nude.

	Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

				VINCENT
		Just kidding around.
			(then mutters)
		So much for love.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

	Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the 
	increasingly uneasy Simon.

				SIMON
		Exactly what is your previous 
		experience?

				VINCENT
		How about that pose?
			(sing-song)
		This is not fun... 
			(then)
		Give me some direction.

	Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He 
	tries not to show it.

				SIMON
		Nothing. I just watch till 
		something strikes me. Do anything 
		you think of -- try different 
		thing. Until I say, "hold that 
		pose." Then just try and 
		comfortably hold it.

				VINCENT
			(trying another space)
		The fact that you haven't said, 
		"hold it" means I haven't done it 
		right...  is that correct? I 
		haven't done it right?

				SIMON
		No...  Okay. What I do is watch 
		and wait for, um... You ever watch 
		someone who doesn't know you're 
		watching...  an old woman on a bus, 
		kids going to school and you see 
		this flash come over them and you 
		know immediately that it has 
		nothing to do with anything 
		external -- that it's in respond 
		to a private thought they just 
		had? They are just sort of realer 
		and more alive. And when you 
		notice it so are you. If you look 
		at someone long enough, you 
		discover their humanity.

	Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an 
	intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

				VINCENT
		I know exactly what you mean.

	There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

				SIMON
		Hold it.

	Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to 
	celebrate.

	INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

	Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their 
	order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story 
	of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. 
	Carol is rapt.

	As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give 
	him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so 
	-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment 
	commentary on her every action.

				MELVIN
		Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- 
		she has to pretend she doesn't 
		hear me. Listening to the story 
		from the upset friend...  now she 
		drops off the cappuccino and 
		smiles at the putzette who doesn't 
		even say, "Thank you." No, the 
		putzette wanted the whipped cream 
		so back she goes and now she has 
		to pass him again and it's getting 
		tougher to make believe.

				CAROL
			(reluctant forgiveness)
		Okay.

	Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an 
	uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

				CAROL
		What's with the plastic picnic 
		ware? Why not try ours...  afraid 
		it isn't clean?

				MELVIN
		I see the help -- judgement call.

				CAROL
		Just give yourself a little pep 
		talk. "Must try other people's 
		clean silverware as part of the 
		fun of dining out."

				MELVIN
		What's wrong with your son, 
		anyway?

				CAROL
		What do you care?

	Melvin just looks at her.

				CAROL
		He's gotta fight to breathe. 
		His asthma can just shoot off the 
		charts -- he's allergic to dust 
		and this is New York and his 
		immune system bails on him when 
		there's trouble so an ear 
		infection...  Is this bothering 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(caught)
		No.

				CAROL
		An ear infection can send us to 
		the emergency room -- maybe five, 
		six times a month where I get 
		whatever nine-year-old they just 
		made a doctor. Nice chatting with 
		you.

				MELVIN
		His name?

				CAROL
		Spencer.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

				CAROL
			(quietly)
		Spence.

	She exits.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

	The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts 
	the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat 
	and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and 
	the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

				SIMON
		You can put on anything you want 
		now. I might be sort of done 
		here... 

	Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his 
	immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every 
	second of silence during the transition... then LOUD 
	MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon 
	does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down -- 
	which Vincent does.

	ANGLE - APARTMENT

	where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- 
	Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all 
	objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses 
	to look past the terrace to the studio.

				DOUG
		Lucky Vinnie -- he's a painting.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY

	MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

				VINCENT
		So you're practically finished, 
		huh?

				SIMON
		Yes...  well, there's one more 
		stage -- trying to figure out if 
		it's any good.

	Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another 
	perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod 
	of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate 
	to distract.

	CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his 
	ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to 
	frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

	As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the 
	canvas.

				VINCENT
		Wait -- I want to see the 
		painting.

				SIMON
		Just a second -- he has to go.

				VINCENT
		Please!! NO!!!

	Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a 
	bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown 
	to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized." 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL 
	stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

	Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he 
	continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing 
	them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

				SIMON
			(to Vincent)
		What's the matter, sweetheart?

	He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the 
	stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in. 
	Doug greets him.

				DOUG
		Yo.

	Simon turns to Vincent.

				SIMON
		Why are you doing this?

				VINCENT
		No. No. No. Hey, that painting 
		in there...  I just want to tell 
		you... 

	Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

				EVAN
			(to Vincent)
		What are you doing? Cruising him?

	And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a 
	club, as the brief savage attack begins.

	ON VERDELL

	as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in 
	fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single 
	BARK from VERDELL.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK

	A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is 
	whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if 
	Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the 
	wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

				RAY
		Okay. So you call 911 and don't 
		leave your name -- even a dumb 
		geezer should know that emergency 
		automatically pulls up your name. 
		How come you make a mistake like 
		that?

				MELVIN
		How come you're pretending to do 
		cop work -- 'cause I don't think 
		you could find your ass if you 
		were spotted the hole.

				RAY
			(stunned)
		What?

				MELVIN
		Just move on. No one here killed 
		him.

				RAY
		Oh, is he dead?

				MELVIN
		Ask him.

				RAY
		We will if we can and if we can't, 
		we'll come back and ask you again 
		and again.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - 
	ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

	Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a 
	leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic 
	little CRYING SOUNDS.

	As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the 
	Sweet-Faced Woman.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		I've been praying for him since I 
		heard.

				FRANK
		So I've got to get to the 
		hospital. If you could take the 
		dog just for tonight.

				SWEET-FACED WOMAN
		Oh, Lord -- I've got all these 
		antique knick-knacks...  Or else 
		I'd be glad... 

				FRANK
		Maybe if you kept locked in 
		the bathroom. No? Okay. Thanks.
			(as he turns away and she 
			closes the door he adds)
		Old bitch...  Damn dog.

	A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed 
	and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings... 

	VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches 
	his mugger:

				FRANK
		You're taking him...  yes...  you're 
		taking him -- this will clear the 
		books. One night. You want to 
		say "no" to me? Try...  because 
		I've never felt as nuts as I do 
		right this second. I almost want 
		you to try saying "no."

				MELVIN
			(quietly)
		I'm not saying nothing to you.

				FRANK
		Thanks for looking after him.

	Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and 
	places Verdell inside.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to 
	block Verdell's escape.

	The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped 
	in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We 
	STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head 
	turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue 
	continues O.S.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Hey, where are you going? You 
		can't do this.
			(calls after Frank)
		I can't take a dog.
			(a confession)
		Nobody's ever been in here before.

				FRANK (O.S.)
			(threatening)
		You don't want to mess with me 
		today. I'll figure something else 
		out tomorrow.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now 
	Melvin sees him.

				MELVIN
		You're dead!!

	VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking 
	along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a 
	bit calming.

				MELVIN
		I don't have dog food. And I 
		won't want dog food here. You'll 
		eat what we have. You'll eat what 
		we eat.

	Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped 
	meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the 
	room.

				MELVIN
		Don't you touch anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC 
	CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and 
	exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking 
	alternately in all directions... his recent past making 
	him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs 
	cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a 
	dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound 
	of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then 
	MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he 
	sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd. 
	Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl 
	with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and 
	sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of 
	Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks 
	over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts 
	and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out 
	the lights and exits.

	INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

	Frank on the phone.

				FRANK
			(into phone)
		Put the solid red dots on three of 
		them and the hold blue dots on two 
		others...  Well, we're not going to 
		sell anything if they know we're 
		two weeks into a show and have no 
		sales. No, you can't reduce a 
		price at this stage...  We're in 
		free fall here. Any calls?

				JACKIE
		We can see him.

				FRANK
		I'll meet you in there.

	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	As Jackie enters.

				JACKIE
		How you doing, great one?

				SIMON
		I haven't looked at myself yet. I 
		figured I could tell from your 
		reaction.

	He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his 
	painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a 
	horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into 
	yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into 
	tears...  sobs, actually.

				SIMON
		That bad, huh?

	They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in 
	the doorway.

				FRANK
		Hey, hey... 
			(as he sees him)
		Haaa...  bad but temporary. The 
		nurses say it's much better than 
		you looked three weeks ago...  the 
		hand will come back...  they're 
		sure... 

				SIMON
		Jackie, will you hand me the 
		mirror?

				JACKIE
			(a small voice)
		No.

	She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- 
	then thinks better of it.

				JACKIE
		Wait, I have a smaller one.

	But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror -- 
	he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

				SIMON
		So, what's new anyway? How's 
		Verdell?

				FRANK
			(sheepish)
		Your neighbor -- Udall -- is 
		taking care of him.

				SIMON
			(suddenly alive and upset)
		How could you do that? He'll hurt 
		him.

				FRANK
		No, I promise...  not a chance. I 
		own this guy. There was no one 
		else. I'm on the move too much. 
		Trust me.

				SIMON
		You are very certain my dog is 
		okay...  because you have no 
		idea... 

				FRANK
		Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.

	Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, 
	then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive 
	underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

				SIMON
		Okay, waiting gives the devil 
		time. Now!

	He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...  
	he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him 
	awed by his misfortune.

				SIMON
		Oh my... Where'd I go? Ummmm?

	EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with 
	his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as 
	she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning 
	periodically to keep an eye of his dog.

				CAROL
		So what are you doing with a dog?

				MELVIN
		Suckered in. Set up. Pushed 
		around.

				CAROL
		You're not worried that someone 
		might take him?

				MELVIN
		Well, not until now -- for 
		Christ's sake.

				CAROL
		Sorry.

				MELVIN
		It's okay -- I'll sit here.

	He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can 
	keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

				CAROL
		You know he's a little dog. Next 
		time, if Bryan's not here, you can 
		bring him in.

				MELVIN
		How old are you?

				CAROL
		Oh, please... 

				MELVIN
		If I had to guess by your eyes, 
		I'd say you were fifty.

	Carol looks at him.

				CAROL
		And if I had to guess by your 
		eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, 
		so much for eyes. But as long as 
		you bring up age...  how old are 
		you?

				MELVIN
			(quickly)
		Otherwise, you're not ugly.

				CAROL
			(laughs out loud)
		Okay, pal...  I accept the 
		compliment, but go easy -- my 
		knees start a-knocking when you 
		turn on the charm full blast.

				MELVIN
		What's with the dark?

	He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

				CAROL
		Dawn patrol -- major dawn patrol. 
		My son had a full blown attack. 
		And this time, for extra fun, they 
		gave us the wrong antibiotics, so 
		I get him home... 

	She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes 
	nuts.

				MELVIN
		No...  no...  leave it...  the 
		bacon's for the dog.

	She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, 
	but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

				MELVIN
		Last week I was playing the piano 
		for him and he likes it, and so I 
		decide I'm going to make a little 
		joke... 

				CAROL
		You all set here?

	Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to 
	finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

	As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a 
	beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is 
	avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.

				MELVIN
		It's a beautiful day for our walk.

	Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

	ON VERDELL

	again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the 
	sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic 
	gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.

				MELVIN
		Don't be like me, don't you be 
		like me. You stay just the way 
		you are because you are a perfect 
		man. I'm gonna take you home and 
		get you something to eat...  what 
		you love.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

				FEMALE PASSERSBY
			(charmed)
		Ohhh. I'd like to be treated like 
		that.

				MELVIN
			(all smiles to Verdell)
		Let's go home and do some writing.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself 
	with great satisfaction as he goes.

	Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his 
	master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing 
	aloud to the dog.

				MELVIN
		"He turned off the gas jets and 
		carried her outside. He kissed 
		her brow and when her eyes opened 
		and found him, he said, 'there are 
		easier ways to break a date.' She 
		laughed. The only sensible 
		ambition he had ever known was now 
		realized. He had made the girl 
		happy. And what a girl. 'You've 
		saved my life,' she said, 'you'd 
		better make it up to me.'"

	Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine... 

				MELVIN
			(singing to Verdell)
		Done!
			(playing with him some)
		Yes, I hate the doggy...  yes, I 
		hate the doggy.

	He exits.

				MELVIN (V.O.)
		Sixty-two books... done!

	As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our 
	couple's play time for... 

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

	As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul 
	mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the 
	maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few 
	words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and 
	talk of how long Nora can stay on.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

	Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

				FRANK
		How's Verdell doing?

				MELVIN
		He's a pain in the ass.

	As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, 
	without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's 
	surprise.

				FRANK
		Simon's home. I was sort of 
		hoping you could keep the dog 
		until he's had a chance to think 
		and adjust... 

				MELVIN
			(leaping at the chance)
		It's been five weeks...  another 
		few won't kill me.

				FRANK
		No. He wants him back. He'll be 
		by tomorrow.

				MELVIN
			(too loudly, weirdly)
		Okay by me.

	Frank exits.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to 
	the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are 
	locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the 
	correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to 
	check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished, 
	until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

	INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

	Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a 
	wheelchair and shudders... 

				MELVIN
		That's some face they left hanging 
		on you. You look like... 

				SIMON
			(interrupting)
		Could you take it just a little 
		easy, Mr. Udall?

	A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

				SIMON
		Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?
			(to Melvin)
		By the way, thanks for saving me.

				MELVIN
		I called. I never touched you. I 
		didn't leave my name or nothing.

				SIMON
			(not listening)
		Verdell?

	ON VERDELL

	Totally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin 
	shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon 
	smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the 
	reunion.

				SIMON
		Hi, sweetheart.

	Verdell isn't eager.

	ON SIMON

	The first gnawing pains of rejection.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get 
	Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the 
	door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog 
	up.

				SIMON
		No. Please, don't force him.

				JACKIE
			(to dog)
		You little stinker. He's given 
		you everything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	MELVIN'S POV

	Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and 
	hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...  
	there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly 
	one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels 
	the panic rise in him... 

	...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and 
	now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

				MELVIN
		Over the dog...  an ugly dog.

	It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual 
	sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite 
	pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but 
	highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared, 
	beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

	EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

	Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then 
	turning into a building with a copper sign reading 
	"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."

				MELVIN
		Worst sidewalk in New York and 
		look where they put in.

	INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

	Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

				MELVIN
		Help!

				DOCTOR
		If you want to see me you will not 
		do this. You will make an 
		appointment... 

				MELVIN
		Explain to me how you can diagnose 
		someone as "obsessive compulsive 
		disorder" and then act like I have 
		any choice in barging in.

				DOCTOR
		There's not going to be a debate. 
		You must leave.

	The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to 
	follow.

				MELVIN
		You said you could help me -- 
		what was that -- a tease?

				DOCTOR
		I can help you if you take the 
		responsibility to keep regular 
		app --

				MELVIN
			(suddenly)
		You changed the room around... 

				DOCTOR
		Two years ago... 

	Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough 
	he must go through a careful exercise noting every new 
	element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies 
	each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued 
	despite himself.

				DOCTOR
		I also regrew my beard...  but 
		you're not interested in changes 
		in me... so it's like I always 
		told you...  when it comes to 
		people you... 

				MELVIN
		Shhhhhhh. I don't have this 
		mountain of available time...  I 
		got to get to my restaurant on 
		time. Do you know how hard it is 
		for me to be here?

				DOCTOR
		Yes.
			(as Melvin starts 
			for the office)
		No.

	INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY

	More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin 
	passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. 
	Eyes on them. Then:

				MELVIN
			(to other patients)
		What if this is as good as it 
		gets?

	They look stricken. He exits.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

	As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief. 
	CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his 
	table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils 
	and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT 
	AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl 
	looks at his utensils.

				CHERYL
		What the heck are those for?

				MELVIN
		No. No. Get Carol.

				CHERYL
		I'm filling in. We don't know if 
		she's coming back. She might have 
		to get a job closer to home.

				MELVIN
		What are you trying to do to me?

				CHERYL
		What the heck do you mean?

				MELVIN
		Hey, elephant girl, call her or 
		something...  just let her do my 
		one meal here. I'll pay whatever. 
		I'll wait.
			(as she doesn't 
			budge; he screams)
		Do it!!!

	The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police 
	that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

				MANAGER
		Out. Be silent or leave.

				MELVIN
		I'll be quiet. Just let me wait. 
		No problem. Get her here -- have 
		her get me two sausages, four 
		bacon, two eggs over easy and 
		coffee. I'm not a prick here -- 
		I'm a great customer. This day is 
		a disaster. I can't handle this, 
		too.

				MANAGER
		Get out immediately or there's 
		going to be trouble.

	Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless 
	situation and rises.

				MELVIN
		There's going to be trouble???

	He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other 
	employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near 
	the door he hands him 20 dollars.

				MELVIN
		Carol's last name?

				BUSBOY
		Connelly.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

	An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

	MELVIN'S POV

	A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever 
	the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of 
	community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving 
	their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local 
	store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

	EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY

	Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. 
	She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a 
	thermometer.

				MELVIN
		I'm hungry.
			(on Carol's astonished 
			look)
		You've upset my whole day. I 
		haven't eaten.

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge 
	he had imagined she might make... 

				MELVIN
		This is not a sexist thing. If 
		you were a waiter I would still be 
		here saying... 

				CAROL
		Are you totally gone? This is my 
		private home... 

				MELVIN
		I am trying to keep emotions out of 
		this. Even though this is an 
		important issue to me and I have 
		strong feelings about the subject.

				CAROL
		What subject? That I wasn't there 
		to take crap from you and bring 
		you eggs? Do you have any control 
		over how creepy you allow yourself 
		to get?

				MELVIN
		Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... 
		and to prove it I have not gotten 
		personal and you have. Why aren't 
		you at work? You're not sick -- 
		you don't look sick... just very 
		tired and bitter.

				CAROL
		My son is sick, okay?

	Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some 
	emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy 
	man at her threshold.

				MELVIN
		What about your mother?

				CAROL
		How do you know about my mother?

				MELVIN
		I hear you talk when I'm 
		waiting!!!

	She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a 
	step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into 
	the room.

				CAROL
		Sorry, honey...  I'll be right 
		there.

				MELVIN
			(uncomfortably)
		How ya doing?

	Spencer just stares at him.

				MELVIN
			(miffed)
		You should answer when someone 
		talks to you... 

	Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then 
	emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs 
	out the door.

				CAROL
		Sorry. There is a limit, Melvin, 
		and I can't handle you teaching 
		my son manners.

	She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son 
	and leads him back to his room.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM

	CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of 
	Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his 
	ear. They both count down the seconds.

				CAROL AND SPENCER
		5...  4...  3...  2...  1...  Bingo.

				SPENCER
		104.9

				CAROL
		We are going to treat ourselves to 
		a cab ride.

	EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol carries her young son through a class of 
	uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She 
	spots Melvin about to enter a cab.

				CAROL
		Melvin, wait!

	The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

				SCHOOL KIDS
		Melvin, wait! Melvin, wait! 
		Melvin, wait!

	He turns to face them.

				MELVIN
		Shut up, kids!

	They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

				CAROL
		Melvin...  give us a lift. We've 
		got to go see our friends at the 
		hospital.

	Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the 
	rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The 
	maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

				MELVIN
		I'll ride up front. Cover your 
		mouth when you cough, kid.

	INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY

	As they settle in and drive off.

				CAROL
		Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital, 
		please and quickly please.

	EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

	As Carol enters the hospital.

				CAROL
			(calling back)
		I owe you three dollars.

	Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son... 

				MELVIN
		Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll 
		get back to work today?

				CAROL
			(furiously)
		No!!! Stay away from me!

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for 
	Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...  
	she has some index cards in her laps which she 
	occasionally consults and shuffles.

				JACKIE
		I feel terrible that I have to... 
		Simon? Forget about the dog for a 
		second.

	Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

				SIMON
		Sorry. What are those cards?

				JACKIE
			(a bit embarrassed)
		Frank's idea. He thought I should 
		have notes so I did this right... 
		maintained focus, didn't get 
		emotional and tried not to terrify 
		you.

				SIMON
			(scared shitless)
		Terrify me?

				JACKIE
		See, he's right. I need the 
		cards.
			(reading from cards)
		Simon, you're broke.

	ANGLE ON VERDELL

	as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

				JACKIE (O.S.)
		The medical bill are 61 thousand 
		now. I've spoken to your parents 
		and they didn't hang up or 
		anything -- they just said they 
		would feel strange calling you.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Well, I can't reach them.

	Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns 
	for:

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		Here, baby...  what is it, 
		Verdell?...  You miss the tough 
		guy... 
			(trying to be 
			Melvin-like)
		Well, here I am, you little pissant 
		mop, happy to see me? How about 
		another ride down the chute? Oh, 
		God...  I don't mean it, 
		sweetheart... 
			(on Jackie's look)
		I'm sorry. I know... 

	Verdell hides behind a chair.

				JACKIE
		Frank loves you. You know that... 
		but I've spoken to him and he 
		feels that --
			(reading from card)
		-- as a businessman, with limited 
		resources... 

				SIMON
		I'll be able to keep my apartment 
		and studio, won't I?...  Just tell 
		me.

	As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

				SIMON
			(overwhelmed)
		Wow... 

	Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet 
	the dog and the dog ducks.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset. 
	He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He 
	is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

	INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

	We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening 
	with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering 
	phone calls, "Premier Publishing."

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
		Yes, you write more than anyone 
		else. Yes, you make us a lot of 
		money, but isn't there someone 
		more appropriate to... 

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I need this. Just say, "Melvin, 
		I'll try," okay?

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE (O.S.)
			(resigned)
		Melvin, I'll try.

	They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She 
	pauses at the elevator.

				FEMALE EXECUTIVE
		Now, on a pleasant note, our son 
		got accepted at Brown. My 
		husband... 

				MELVIN
			(curtly)
		Great, wonderful. I don't need 
		you to wait with me.

	She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe 
	summons her moxie.

				ZOE
		I can't resist. You usually move 
		through here so quickly and I have 
		so many questions I want to ask 
		you. You have no idea what your 
		work means to me.

				MELVIN
		What's it mean?

				ZOE
		That somebody out there knows what 
		it's like to be... 
			(taps her head and heart)
		in here.

				MELVIN
		Oh God, this is like a nightmare.

				ZOE
		Aw come on, just a couple of 
		questions -- how hard is that?

	As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button 
	etc.

				ZOE
		How do you write women so well?

				MELVIN
			(as he turns 
			toward her)
		I think of a man and take away 
		reason and accountability.

	The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

	EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

	A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is 
	suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

	CAROL'S POV

	A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.

	BACK TO SCENE

	As Carol breaks into a run.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY

	As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and 
	jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering 
	sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

				CAROL
		Hello? Hello?

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Mrs. Connelly, I'm in here.

	The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, 
	her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk 
	on opening day of the hunting season.

	INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY

				CAROL
		What? Please? Now? Tell me?!

				DR. BETTES
		Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes
		...  Dr. Bettes.

				CAROL
		Not your name...  what are you 
		telling me your name for!! Where 
		is he?

				DR. BETTES
		He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.

				CAROL
			(overlapping)
		Tell me how bad it is. I let him 
		go out last night when it was so 
		cool without an overshirt -- just 
		and underone with just the straps 
		and I know better...  and I let him 
		talk me into it. He was whining 
		and...  you don't need this. Give 
		me a second to catch hold.

	And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some 
	notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it 
	takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and 
	she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer 
	enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now. 
	Salvation as farce.

				SPENCER
			(to his mother)
		Hi... 
			(they kiss)
		Did you know there are doctors who 
		come to your house?

				CAROL
		No, I didn't.
			(to Bettes)
		So why are you h... 

	Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient 
	which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

				BEVERLY
		I didn't know you had a secret 
		admire.

				CAROL
		Huh?

				BEVERLY
		You met the gift.

				SPENCER
		He's good...  And I'm an expert on 
		doctors.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		Stay out of this...  Doctor?

				DR. BETTES
		My wife is Melvin Udall's 
		publisher.
			(as Carol reacts)
		She says I have to take great care 
		of this guy because you're 
		urgently needed back at work. 
		What work do you do?

				CAROL
		I'm a waitress.

	ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

				BEVERLY
		In Manhattan.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Bettes?

				DR. BETTES
		In here.

	A NURSE enters.

				NURSE
		Sorry it took so long. I don't 
		know Brooklyn.

				DR. BETTES
		It's okay, Terry.
			(hands her blood 
			vail)
		Tell the lab I'd like the report 
		back today.

	Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

				CAROL
		You're going to get the results 
		today?!

	MOVING SHOT

	As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from 
	each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation. 
	Bettes is examining medicine bottles.

				DR. BETTES
		How long has he been having 
		problems?

				CAROL
		Since forever.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done blood tests on him?

				CAROL
		Yes.

				DR. BETTES
		Only in the emergency room or when 
		he was well.

				CAROL
		Emergency room only.

				DR. BETTES
		Have they done skin testing for 
		allergies?

				CAROL
		No.

				DR. BETTES
		They haven't done the standard 
		scratch test. Where they make 
		small injections into the skin?

				CAROL
		No. I asked. They said it's not 
		covered under my plan. And it's 
		not necessary anyway.

				DR. BETTES
		It's amazing these things weren't 
		done.

				CAROL
		Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of 
		shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.

				DR. BETTES
		No. Actually, I think that's 
		their technical name.

				CAROL
		Once the tests come back, is there 
		someone I can reach in your office 
		for the results?

				DR. BETTES
		Me. My home number is on this 
		card.

				CAROL
		His home number.

	Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly 
	has a hard time stopping.

				CAROL
			(to doctor)
		Do you want some juice or coffee 
		or two female slaves?

				DR. BETTES
		Water...  Nobody told you it might 
		be a good idea to remove the 
		carpeting and drapes in Spencer's 
		room?

				CAROL
		No.

	She starts towards Spencer's room.

				DR. BETTES
		You don't have to do it this 
		second...  it's not dangerous or 
		anything. It's just something 
		that's advisable. Look, there's 
		a lot to be checked but...  Hey, 
		your son is going to feel a 
		good deal better at the very 
		least... 

	She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce 
	intimacy.

				CAROL
		Doc!!!
			(then)
		So listen, you gotta let me know 
		about the additional costs -- one 
		way or the other we'll... 

				DR. BETTES
		They're considerable. But Mr. 
		Udall wants to be billed.

	She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained 
	Nora hugs him good-bye.

				NORA
		You poor, poor man.

				SIMON
		Let's use just one poor, okay? 
		Anyway, dear, thanks for 
		everything. Forgive my recent 
		crankiness and as soon as things 
		are on track again I'll call.

	She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a 
	sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				NORA
		Who's going to walk Verdell?

	Simon hadn't thought of this either.

				SIMON
		No, no.

	INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY

	Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin 
	opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

				MELVIN
		Is he dead yet?

				NORA
		No! Would there be any way for 
		you to be willing to walk his dog 
		for him?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely.

				NORA
		Not just today -- Uh, could you 
		do it -- until, until he gets 
		back on his feet?

				MELVIN
		Sure thing.

				NORA
		You're a wonderful man. Two 
		o'clock is a good time. Here's 
		the key in case he's asleep. Open 
		the curtains for him, so he sees 
		God's beautiful work and knows 
		that even things like this happen 
		for the best.

				MELVIN
		Where'd they teach you to talk 
		like this -- some Panama City 
		"Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? 
		Or was today getaway day and your 
		last shot at his whiskey. Sell 
		crazy some place else -- we're all 
		stocked up here.

	He closes the door in her face. She stands there... 
	thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper 
	shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the 
	elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then 
	continues on her way.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT

	The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

				CAROL
		There is a seriously goofy man 
		behind this. You are not allowed 
		to block out that fact.

				BEVERLY
		Do you really want to go back to 
		the runt doctors in Emergency who 
		keep telling us they can't help?

				CAROL
		It lets a crazy man into our 
		lives.

				BEVERLY
		Come on. Why fight when we know 
		how it will come out. This isn't 
		like stocking or a string of 
		pearls. You don't send this one 
		back.

	EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

	INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS. 
	He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that 
	reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult 
	struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he 
	answers.

				SIMON
		Hello?...  yes...  sure...  finally, 
		huh? Why, "finally"? Because I 
		called you so many times. Maybe 
		20.
			(relief)
		Oh, boy...  I was hoping it was 
		something like that. You didn't 
		get one of them, huh? 'Cause I 
		mean it wasn't only your office -- 
		it was your home, hotel and the 
		cigar club you like in San 
		Francisco. No -- Sarcastic...  Of 
		course. I believe you. No, don't 
		fire anyone...  Please. Maybe I'm 
		wrong about the 20 times. Take a 
		breath... 
			(more)
		So, you miss me a little? Hey, 
		strike the question -- How's the 
		case going? Really. Fantastic. 
		I didn't hear. I haven't been 
		watching. Great. Just great. 
		I'm so happy. Whoopie! Me? 
		Well, I'm mending. No, I look 
		fine. Well, some of the damage 
		might still be noticeable if you 
		look closely... 

	He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and 
	beaten face... 

				SIMON
		Carl, I need some help and you're 
		the logical one to turn to.
			(aghast)
		No! Not 'cause I blame you for 
		what happened. I hardly get how 
		you can ever think that. No, I'm 
		not being sarcastic.
			(trying to figure it 
			out)
		I guess because you hired the guy 
		who did this you think...  No, I am 
		a sarcastic person. Well, if 
		you must know, the reason I said 
		you were the logical person is 
		because you always told me how you 
		thought I was this great person 
		who made you feel good about 
		humanity and everything. You do 
		remembering saying that? Well, whew. 
		Okay, so Carl. I hate asking but 
		this money thing is ridiculously 
		serious... 

	He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes 
	the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

				SIMON
		"Will you please loan me money? I 
		will pay you back. I will give 
		you whatever percentage of my 
		income I don't absolutely need 
		until I do. It will take a while. 
		But I don't know what I'll do if 
		you say"... that.
			(as he listens)
		I understand...  yes...  No, I do.
			(a bit of boldness)
		But you know, you know -- you 
		didn't even ask how much, Carl? 
		Well, Frank has no right to 
		discuss how much I'm in hock... 
		no, you're right -- not the point. 
		So...  what have you been up to??? 
		Uh-huh... Oh, the group show...  
		how was it? Well, I'm not 
		surprised that there's that much 
		talent around...  great...  Look -- 
		gotta go...  no, you shouldn't feel 
		that way at all...  take care, you, 
		too...  you, too...  Good-bye.
			(as he hangs up)
		Pal o' mine.

	It's very quiet.

	LONG SHOT - SIMON

	A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his 
	face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional 
	release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous 
	with the moment of catharsis... 

	...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the 
	CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to 
	focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering 
	the room.

				MELVIN
		Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

				SIMON
		Thank you for walking him.

	Simon wheels away from Melvin.

				SIMON
		If you'll excuse me I'm not 
		feeling so well.

				MELVIN
		It smells like shit in here?

				SIMON
		Go away.

				MELVIN
		That cleaning woman doesn't... 

				SIMON
		Please, just leave.

				MELVIN
		Where are all your queer party 
		friends?

				SIMON
			(his first shout)
		Get out.

	Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon 
	with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

				SIMON
		Nothing worse than having to feel 
		this way in front of you?

				MELVIN
		Nellie, you're a disgrace to 
		depression.

				SIMON
		Rot in hell, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		No need to stop being a lady... 
		quit worrying -- you'll be back on 
		your knees in no time.

	Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden 
	attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

				SIMON
		Is this fun for you? Well, you 
		lucky devil...  It just gets better 
		and better. I am losing my 
		apartment and Frank wants me to 
		promise to paint hotter subjects 
		and to beg my parents, who haven't 
		called, for help... and I won't. 
		And I don't want to paint anymore.

	Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.

				SIMON
		So the life I was trying for is 
		over. The life I had is gone and 
		I am feeling so damn sorry for 
		myself that it is difficult to 
		breathe. Right times for you -- 
		huh, Melvin. The gay neighbor is 
		terrified... 
			(a sudden screamed 
			word surprises them 
			both)
		Terrified...  Lucky you, you're 
		here for rock bottom...  me 
		wallowing in self-pity in front of 
		you, you absolute horror of a 
		human being... 

	As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with 
	discomfort.

				MELVIN
		Well, I'll do one thing for you 
		that might cheer you up.

				SIMON
		Get out.

				MELVIN
		Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. 
		You want to know why the dog 
		prefers me...  it's not affection. 
		It's a trick.

	Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's 
	rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

				MELVIN
		I carry bacon in my pocket.

				SIMON
			(pleased)
		Oh, my gosh.

				MELVIN
			(hands him bacon)
		Now we'll both call him.

				SIMON
		Come on, sweetheart... 

				MELVIN
		Yo, yo, yo... 

	Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally 
	surprised and staggered by the implications. True love 
	and such.

				SIMON
		Would you leave now, please?

				MELVIN
		Stupid dog.
			(to Simon)
		I don't get it.

	He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic 
	ruin.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...  She is in turmoil... 
	there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen. 
	She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

	INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

	The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol 
	shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

	Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving 
	her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy 
	here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer 
	dress -- no time for underwear.

	EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

	Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

	EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM

	Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on 
	her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the 
	subject.

	EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING - 
	NIGHT (RAIN)

	Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the 
	rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood.

	ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE

	As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on 
	it.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)

	As she enters building and realizes it's not just that 
	she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet 
	T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts, 
	like the old movie poster of The Deep.

	INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of 
	Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness 
	and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally 
	Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side 
	of the door.

				CAROL
		Uh, Udall?

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		Carol the waitress?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her 
	breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it 
	straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is 
	static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it 
	self-conscious pats.

				CAROL
		The doctors had your billing 
		address. I'm sorry about the 
		hour.

				MELVIN
		I was working...  can't you just 
		drop me a thank-you note?

				CAROL
		That's not why I'm here... 
			(tearing suddenly)
		...  though you have no idea what 
		it's like to have a real 
		conversation with a doctor about 
		Spencer... 

				MELVIN
			(very uncomfortable)
		Note. Put it in the note.

				CAROL
		Why did yo do this for me?

				MELVIN
		To get you back at work so you can 
		wait on me.

				CAROL
		But you do have some idea how 
		strange that sounds??? I'm 
		worried that you did this 
		because... 

	She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long 
	silence. Finally.

				MELVIN
		You waiting for me to say 
		something?
			(as she shakes her head)
		What sort of thing do you want? 
		Look, I'll be at the restaurant 
		tomorrow.

				CAROL
		I don't think I can wait until 
		tomorrow. This needs clearing up.

				MELVIN
		What needs clearing up?

				CAROL
			(strong and true)
		I'm not going to sleep with you. 
		I will never, ever sleep with you. 
		Never. Not ever.

	Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the 
	brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to 
	scream --

	-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt 
	during his half turn away from her -- and then answer 
	hoarsely.

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry. We don't open for the 
		no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

	Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way 
	ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.

				CAROL
		I'm not kidding.

				MELVIN
		Okay!!!! Anything else?!?

				CAROL
		Just how grateful I am.

	Her mission completed -- she turns.

				MELVIN
		So you'll be at work?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's 
	night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've 
	seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor 
	twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his 
	body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

	He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays 
	very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his 
	forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light 
	on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator... 

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR - 
	NIGHT

	As he grabs a cardboard take-out box... 

	INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.
	
	He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.

	SIMON'S APARTMENT

				MELVIN
		I took a chance you were up.

	Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

				MELVIN
		I brought you Chinese soup.

				SIMON
		Thanks.

				MELVIN
		I have never been so tired in my 
		life. Okay, if I sit here?

				SIMON
		Got any easier questions?

	Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

				MELVIN
		I haven't been sleeping. I 
		haven't been clear or felt like 
		myself. I'm in trouble. Some son 
		of a bitch is burning my bridges 
		behind my back...  But the 
		tiredness -- boy...  Not just 
		sleepy.

				SIMON
		But sick -- nauseous -- where 
		everything looks distorted and 
		everything inside just aches -- 
		when you can barely get up the 
		will to complain.

				MELVIN
			(brightening)
		Yeah... 

	He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to 
	take it from here.

				MELVIN
		I'm glad we did this.

	He rises and makes an awkward exit.

				MELVIN
		Good talking to you.

	He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to 
	express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed 
	pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't 
	even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and 
	is let in by Beverly.

	They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly 
	hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over 
	Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and 
	emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my 
	conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how 
	gratefull (sic)... "

				BEVERLY
		You're not still writing that 
		thank-you note?

				CAROL
		I'm on the last page. How do you 
		spell conscience?

				BEVERLY
		C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean 
		from the bakery to baby-sit so 
		let's go out.

				CAROL
		I still don't feel safe leaving 
		Spencer with someone. How do you 
		spell it again?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer is okay. You'd better 
		start finding something else to do 
		with your free time. If you can't 
		feel good about this break and 
		step out a little... 
			(struts and pumps 
			her arms)
		You ought to get Mr. Udall to send 
		you over a psychiatrist.

				CAROL
			(more emotionally 
			than she intended)
		I don't need one 'cause I know 
		what's really going on here. I 
		have to finish this letter or 
		I'll go nuts.
			(looking at paper; 
			weepy)
		This can't be right -- con-
		science.

	Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself 
	on the brink of crying.

				BEVERLY
		Carol. What?

	Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able 
	to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she 
	looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission 
	for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol 
	-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

				CAROL
		I don't know... It's very strange 
		not feeling that stupid panic 
		thing inside you all the time. 
		Without that you just start 
		thinking about yourself -- and 
		what does that ever get anybody. 
		Today, on the bus there was this 
		adorable couple and I felt myself 
		giving them a dirty look -- I had 
		no idea everything was... 

				BEVERLY
		Go ahead.

				CAROL
			(great, forceful 
			hand gestures)
		... moving in the wrong 
		direction... Away from when I 
		even remembered what it was like 
		to have a man to... anything... 
		hold fucking -- sorry -- hands 
		with, for Christ's sake. I was 
		feeling like really bad that Dr. 
		Bettes is married.
			(this next one's 
			tough)
		Which is probably why I make poor 
		Spencer hug me more than he wants 
		to... Like the poor kid doesn't 
		have enough problems. He has to 
		make up for his mom not getting 
		any.
			(weeps at her 
			insight)
		Oh, boy. Who needs these 
		thoughts?

				BEVERLY
		Spencer's doing fine. So what are 
		you saying, that you're frustr... 

				CAROL
		Leave me be! Why are you doing 
		this? Why are you picking at my 
		sores... What is it that you 
		want?... You want what? What's 
		with you? I hope getting me 
		thinking of everything that's 
		wrong when all I want is to not 
		do this has some purpose.
			(puffy; red; 
			furious)
		What is it, Mom? No kidding.

	Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked 
	husky voiced question.

				CAROL
		What is it you want? What?

				BEVERLY
		I want us to go out.

	A beat, then.

				CAROL
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT

	As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their 
	cry.

				CAROL
			(to Sean)
		We're going out.

				SEAN
			(looking at their 
			red eyes)
		Looks like fun.

	She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what 
	he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

				CAROL
		Okay -- we're out of here. I love 
		you.

	Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol 
	as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading. 
	Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself, 
	going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then 
	to her son to ask:

				CAROL
		Do you love me?

				SPENCER
		Uh-huh.

	Carol exits.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY

	Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A 
	simple and unprecedented experience in their recent 
	lives.

				BEVERLY
		Nice to get out, isn't it?

	Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each 
	other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

	INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY

	As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her 
	14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated 
	at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa 
	keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.

				CAROL
		Don't get it wet.

	Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

				CAROL
		So it's okay?

				LISA
		You almost have me liking him. 
		You sure come from the heart. I 
		never knew what you went through 
		with everything.

				CAROL
		I wanted him to know how much he'd 
		done.
			(looking over)
		Can you believe he's eating with 
		someone.

	ON MELVIN & FRANK

				MELVIN
		It's not my dog and this Simon 
		seems to have enough on his mind 
		-- but he did throw up twice and 
		his spark is off.

				FRANK
		Sure -- take him to the vet.

				MELVIN
		I did. And his stomach is out of 
		whack. So they need him for a 
		couple of days.

				FRANK
		Do it.

				CAROL
		Melvin.

	She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

				MELVIN
		What's this?

				CAROL
			(sotto)
		A thank-you note for what you did 
		for me.

	He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and 
	walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, 
	confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.

	After Carol leaves... 

				FRANK
		She's nice.

				MELVIN
			(to Frank)
		Really nice. Shouldn't that be a 
		good thing... telling someone, 
		'no thanks required.'

				FRANK
		It looks like it really went over. 
		You're sure making the rounds. 
		Simon says you brought him soup 
		last night. I hope he doesn't 
		write you a note.

	Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing 
	message.

				FRANK
		What?

				MELVIN
		"What?" Look at you... You sense 
		a mark.

				FRANK
		Hey -- you called me... I... 

				MELVIN
		About a dog.

				FRANK
		Yeah, but it's all about Simon 
		now... you helped with the dog... 
		And now there are other things. 
		I'm just as concerned as you are 
		about Simon.

				MELVIN
		Concerned. I'm just the hall 
		monitor here.

				FRANK
		It's not only financial 
		assistance. What he's got to do 
		is go to Baltimore tomorrow and 
		ask his parents for money. It's 
		not going to happen on the phone.

				MELVIN
		Yeah. If his parents are alive 
		they've got to help -- those are 
		the rules. Good.

				FRANK
		Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high 
		maintenance selling painter coming 
		through... So I'm out. Can you 
		take him?

				MELVIN
		Think white and get serious.

	Carol enters scene.

				FRANK
		Take my car -- a convertible. Do 
		you drive?

				MELVIN
			(loudly)
		Like the wind but I'm not doing 
		it.

				CAROL
		Getting loud, getting loud.

				MELVIN
		He wants me to take his car and 
		his client to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		I want your life for a minute 
		where my big problem is someone 
		offers me a free convertible so I 
		can get out of this city.

	She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

				MELVIN
		Okay. I'll take him. Get him 
		packed -- ready -- tomorrow 
		morning.

	Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

				MELVIN
			(excited)
		Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. 
		Let's not drag this out. We don't 
		enjoy another that much.

				FRANK
		If there's some mental health 
		foundation that raises money to 
		help people like you be sure to 
		let me know.

				MELVIN
		Last word freak.

	Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a 
	"good-bye" to him.

				CAROL
		So. Anything else?

				MELVIN
		Yes. I'm going to give my queer 
		neighbor a lift to Baltimore.

				CAROL
		Okay.

				MELVIN
		Hey, what I did for you is working 
		out?

				CAROL
			(a breath; then)
		What you did changed my life.

	She offers him the note.

				MELVIN
		No... no thank you notes.

				CAROL
		Well, part of what I said in this 
		entire history of my life which 
		you won't read is that somehow 
		you've done more for my mother, my 
		son and me, than anyone else ever 
		has... And that makes you the most 
		important, surprising, generous 
		person I've ever met and that you 
		be in our daily prayers forever.

				MELVIN
		Lovely.

				CAROL
		I also wrote one part... I wrote 
		I'm sorry... I was talking about I 
		was sorry when I got mad at you 
		when you came over and you told my 
		son that he ought to answer back 
		so I wrote that.
			(reading from the 
			letter, Melvin 
			wildly uncomfortable)
		I was sorry for busting you on 
		that... and I'm sorry for busting 
		in on you that night... when I 
		said I was never... I was sorry 
		and I'm sorry every time your food 
		was cold and that you had to wait 
		two seconds for a coffee filler... 

	Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it -- 
	emotionally moved by her own words.

				CAROL
		... and I'm sorry for never 
		spotting, right there at the table 
		in the restaurant, the human being 
		that had it in him to do this 
		thing for us... You know what, I'm 
		just going to start from the 
		beginning... I have not been able 
		to express my gratefulness to 
		you... even as I look at the word 
		"grateful" now it doesn't begin to 
		tell you what I feel for you... 

	And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

				MELVIN
		Nice of you... thank you.

				CAROL
		Thank you.

				MELVIN
		Now I want you to do something for me.

	She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

				CAROL
		Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, 
		"what?" I thought I said, 
		"what?"... What?

				MELVIN
		I want you to go on this trip.

				CAROL
		No, sir... 

				MELVIN
		I can't do this alone. I'm afraid 
		he'll pull the stiff one eye on 
		me. I need you to chaperon. 
		Separate everything but cars. You 
		said you liked convertibles. Now 
		I'm on the hook.

				CAROL
		The stiff one eye?

				MELVIN
		Two days.

				CAROL
		I can't. I work.

				MELVIN
		You take off when you have to.

				CAROL
		My son.

				MELVIN
		Bettes tells me he's doing fine.

				CAROL
			(no other way)
		Melvin, I'd rather not.

				MELVIN
		What's that got to do with it?

				CAROL
		Funny, I thought it was a strong 
		point.

				MELVIN
		Write me a note and ain't she 
		sweet. I need a hand and where'd 
		she go.

				CAROL
		Are you saying accepting your help 
		obligates me!?

				MELVIN
		Is there another way to see it?

				CAROL
		No.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf 
	of the closet.

				CAROL
		Well, here's a little suitcase 
		shocked that it's been used.

	She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's 
	too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another 
	drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries 
	of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

	INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER

	Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday 
	"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it 
	back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

				CAROL
			(furiously exasperated)
		There's not way to pack for this 
		trip... well, I'll tell you -- I'm 
		not packing the camera.

	As she exits the room --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

	As she picks up the phone.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly 
	stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a 
	camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items -- 
	underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each 
	one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds 
	another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing 
	development. He has almost no recent experience with 
	receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little 
	comment to himself as he moves.

				MELVIN
		Woo-woo.

	He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is 
	-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but 
	before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his 
	throat.

	ON CAROL

	As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a 
	pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

				CAROL
		Hello?

				MELVIN
		Are you still coming?

				CAROL
		Yes.

	Melvin visibly relaxes.

				CAROL
		Melvin... I'd like to know exactly 
		where we are going.

				MELVIN
		Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. 
		So I know what you're going to ask 
		next.
			(correcting himself)
		That you might ask -- I'm not 
		certain.

				CAROL
		There's... there's no need to 
		bring anything dressy... or... I 
		mean -- I didn't know if we'd be 
		eating at any restaurant that 
		have dress codes.

				MELVIN
		Oh.
			(a beat)
		We might. Yes. We can. Let's.

				CAROL
		Okay, gotcha. What did you think 
		I was going to ask?

				MELVIN
		Whether crabs are in season there 
		now... 

				CAROL
		Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good 
		night.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

				BEVERLY
		How was it talking to him?

				CAROL
		Stop treating this like I'm going 
		away with a man. He's just going 
		to say those crappy, sick, 
		complaining, angry things to me. 
		I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. 
		He's a freak show -- the worst 
		person I ever met.

				BEVERLY
		Well, maybe he has nice friends.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

	Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches. 
	She kisses them.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		You stand there and I'll wave to 
		you from the back window.

	As she boards the bus.

				BEVERLY
		Call me as soon as you're settled.

				CAROL
			(to Spencer)
		I love you.

	The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them 
	open.

				CAROL
			(to bus driver)
		Sensitive, huh?!

	The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at 
	his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing 
	himself.

	INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

	A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as 
	Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

	On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black 
	dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

				VETERINARIAN
		Anything unusual in the dog's 
		diet?

				MELVIN
		No. Everybody gets their own 
		cage?

				VETERINARIAN
		Certainly.

				MELVIN
			(pointing to 
			Chihuahua)
		Put him in with that one, not that 
		one... 
			(pointing to large 
			dog)
		... Builds his confidence.

	EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	Carol disembarks.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

	As she walks and turns a corner.

	CLOSE ON CAROL

	The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death 
	chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do 
	not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws" 
	will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect 
	couldn't be grimmer.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

	CLOSER ON MELVIN

	He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the 
	tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the 
	building.

				FRANK
		I'm sorry that I'm not taking 
		you.

				SIMON
			(upset)
		So am I, Frank.

	Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

				MELVIN
		Soak it up -- it's your last 
		chance at a hug for a few days.

	As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor 
	changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

				CAROL
		Hi.

				MELVIN
		Thanks for being on time... Carol, 
		the waitress, this is Simon, the 
		fag.

				CAROL
		Hello... Oh, my God, who did that 
		to you?

				SIMON
		I, uh... I was... attacked. 
		Walked in on people robbing me. I 
		was hospitalized. I almost died.

				MELVIN
		Let's do the small talk in the 
		car. Load up.

	Carol puts her bag in the car.

				MELVIN
		I was going to do that for you.

				CAROL
			(taken aback)
		It's okay. No problem. Where 
		should we sit?

				MELVIN
			(totally non-plussed)
		I -- uh, I... Well, there is no 
		place cards or anything.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me go in back. You look like 
		you need all the room you can 
		manage.

				SIMON
		That's very thoughtful.

				MELVIN
		Never a break. Never.

	Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's 
	not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small 
	back seat. She struggles to get her feet in. 

				MELVIN
		You're really jammed back there.

	He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his 
	seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving 
	Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel. 
	She is startled by the gesture.

				CAROL
		Thanks, Melvin.

				MELVIN
		Welcome.

	And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

	EXT. 12TH STREET

	Turning onto Fifth.

				MELVIN
		I got the whole ride programmed.

	CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all 
	carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the 
	one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly 
	and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick 
	burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

				MELVIN
		Just wanted to see what you'd do. 
		No, we have greatness here.

	He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS 
	UP."

	The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY 
	SELECTED MUSIC.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		Hey, I like this music.

	And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	The three of them... Carol chattering away.

				CAROL
		I don't know the last time I've 
		been out of the city... Hey, my 
		arms are tanning. I used to tan 
		great. We gotta stop soon so'se 
		I can check on Spencer.

				SIMON
			(during the above)
		I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I 
		can't turn my head all the way 
		yet... tell her we can't hear her.

				MELVIN
		Doesn't matter. She's enjoying 
		herself. Consider it part of the 
		music.

	EXT. ROAD - DAY

	A short time later. Carol is now driving.

				CAROL
		I'm sure, Simon, they did 
		something real off for you to feel 
		this way... But when it comes to 
		your partners -- or your kid -- 
		things will always be off for you 
		unless you set it straight. Maybe 
		this thing happened to you just to 
		give you that chance.

				MELVIN
		Nonsense!

				CAROL
		Anybody here who's interested in 
		what Melvin has to say raise their 
		hands.

	Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus 
	declared their majority.

				SIMON
		Do you want to know what happened 
		with my parents?

				CAROL
		Yes. I really would.

				SIMON
		Well... 

				CAROL
		No, let me pull over so I can pay 
		full attention.

	Car pulling over toward parking spot.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY

	She takes the car curbside and parks.

				CAROL
		Now go ahead.

	Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks 
	innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something 
	-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

				SIMON
		Well, I always painted. Always. 
		And my mother always encouraged 
		it. She was sort of fabulous 
		about it actually... and she used 
		to... I was too young to think 
		there was anything at all wrong 
		with it... and she was very 
		natural. She used to pose nude 
		for me... and I thought or assumed 
		my father was aware of it.

				MELVIN
		This stuff is pointless.

				CAROL
		Hey -- you let him... 

				MELVIN
		You like sad stories -- you want 
		mine.

				CARL
		. Go ahead, Simon. Really. 
		Please. Don't let him stop you. Ignore him.

				SIMON
		Okay. Well, one day my father 
		came in on one of those painting 
		sessions when I was nine -- and he 
		just started screaming at her -- 
		at us -- at evil. And... 

				MELVIN
			(very quickly)
		... my father didn't leave his 
		room for 11 years -- he hit my 
		hand with a yardstick if I made a 
		mistake on the piano.

				CAROL
		Go ahead, Simon. Your father 
		walked in on you and was yelling 
		and... really, come on.

				SIMON
		I was trying to defend my mother 
		and make peace, in the lamest way. 
		I said, "she's not naked -- it's 
		art." And then he started hitting 
		me. And he beat me unconscious. 
		After that he talked to me less 
		and less -- he knew before I left 
		for college, my dad came into my 
		room. He held out his hand. It 
		was filled with money. A big wad 
		of sweaty money.
			(gathers himself)
		And he said to me, "I don't want 
		you to ever come back." I grabbed 
		him and I hugged him... He turns 
		and walked out.

	Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as 
	strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so 
	much more complicated than her meat and potatoes 
	troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her 
	fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, 
	understated, gesture of friendship.

				CAROL
		Well, you know -- I still stay 
		what I said. You've got to get 
		past it all when it comes to your 
		parents. We all have these horror 
		stories to get over.

	Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

				MELVIN
		That's not true. Some of us have 
		great stories... pretty stories 
		that take place at lakes with 
		boats and friends and noodle 
		salad. Just not anybody in this 
		car. But lots of people -- that's 
		their story -- good times and 
		noodle salad... and that's what 
		makes it hard. Not that you had 
		it bad but being that pissed that 
		so many had it good.

				CAROL
		No.

				SIMON
		Not it at all, really.

				MELVIN
			(a veteran's irony)
		Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to 
		the hotel. And if you're lucky 
		tomorrow Dad will give you another 
		wad of sweaty money.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY

				MELVIN
		Two bedrooms and the sofa opens... 

	Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		No answer... Maybe we should just 
		drive there tomorrow. Can I have 
		that one?

				MELVIN
		Yes... sure.
			(to Simon)
		I'll take the sofa.

	Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever 
	have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials... 

				CAROL
			(into phone)
		Hello... Hi, Spencer... Why are 
		you out of breath? You did?!? 
		That is great... So great... So -- 
		no, wait a second, Spence... 

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

	Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially 
	neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

				MELVIN
		Can I ask you a personal question?

	Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

				MELVIN
		Do you ever get an erection for a 
		woman?

				SIMON
		Melvin... 

				MELVIN
		Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier 
		if you were not... 

				SIMON
		You consider your life easy.

				MELVIN
		I give you that one... 
			(eyes suitcase)
		Nice packing.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting 
	there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new 
	factors in her life.

				CAROL
		My son was outside playing soccer. 
		I never saw him playing ball. Come 
		on, you guys -- take me out for a 
		good time... Take me out dancing.

				MELVIN
		Dancing?

				SIMON
		I can't, I'm exhausted.

	Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is 
	visibly disturbed by her gesture.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		I don't blame you... This is a 
		monumental first day out... You 
		sad or anything?

				SIMON
		No... Nervous. It would be very 
		rough, Carol, if you weren't 
		along.

				CAROL
		What a nice compliment.

	She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy. 
	She turns to him.

				CAROL
		I'm happy. And you're my date. 
		Let's get dressed.

	She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

				MELVIN
		I'm going to jump in the shower. 
		I'll be right with you.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main 
	room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she 
	sits down to wait -- through... 

	SERIES OF DISSOLVES

	Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until 
	finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom 
	through a cloud of steam. They exit.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they drive up.

				VALET
		Good evening, sir.

				MELVIN
		They sell hard shell crabs here?

				VALET
		Yes.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As they enters... 

				HEAD WAITER
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		Hi. You have hard shells, right?

				CAROL
		Stop asking everyone.

				MELVIN
		Just him and that's it. Okay, you 
		can answer -- we've worked it out.

				HEAD WAITER
		Yes, we do... And I can give you a 
		tie and jacket.

				MELVIN
		What?

				HEAD WAITER
		They require a tie and jacket but 
		we have some available.

	He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

				MELVIN
		No... I'm not wearing that -- and 
		just in case you were going to ask 
		I'm not going to let you inject me 
		with plaque either.

				CAROL
		You promised a nice place -- can't 
		you just... 
			(to Head Waiter)
		You have these dry cleaned all the 
		time, don't you?

				HEAD WAITER
		Actually, I don't think so.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Wait here.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

	EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

	As the car goes right across the street to a shopping 
	mall.

	INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT

	Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

				SALESMAN
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		I need a coat and tie.

	OTHER ANGLE

	CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so 
	that passage for Melvin is impossible.

				SALESMAN
		Come on in.

				MELVIN
		No.

				SALESMAN
		No?

				MELVIN
			(pointing)
		That jacket and give me a tie.

	EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

				VALET #2
		Good evening.

				MELVIN
		You have hard shells?

				VALET #2
		I'm not sure.

				MELVIN
		Everyone else says you do.

				VALET #2
		Then I guess we do.

	INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

	As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is 
	having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool -- 
	watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning 
	down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin 
	watches... Watches his date.

				HEAD WAITER
		Shall I get her for you?

				MELVIN
		No, it's all right. I'll just 
		watch.

	He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns 
	-- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture... 
	and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has 
	lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her. 
	She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables, 
	giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g. 
	She notices the waiter in her trail.

				CAROL
			(mouthing the words 
			to Melvin)
		My drink is following me.

	Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite. 
	He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

				CAROL
		You look s... 

	She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then... 

				CAROL
		You look great.

	They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

				CAROL
		You wanna dance?

				MELVIN
		I've been thinking about that 
		since you brought it up before.

				CAROL
			(rising)
		And?

				MELVIN
		No... 
			(and before she can 
			digest that)
		... I don't get this place. They 
		make me buy an outfit but they let 
		you wear a house dress. I don't 
		get it.

	ON CAROL

	Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in 
	extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.

				MELVIN
		No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't 
		mean it. You gotta sit down. You 
		can still give me the dirty 
		look... just sit down and give it 
		to me.

				CAROL
		Melvin, pay me a compliment... I 
		need one and quick... You have no 
		idea how much what you said just 
		hurt my feelings.

				MELVIN
			(really pissed, 
			mutters)
		That monominute somebody gets that 
		you need them they threaten to go 
		away. Never fails.

				CAROL
		That's not compliment, Melvin... 
		That's just trying to sound smart 
		so I feel stupid... A compliment 
		is something nice about somebody 
		else... Now or never.

				MELVIN
		Okay.

	He waves her down.

				CAROL
			(sitting)
		And mean it... 

				MELVIN
		Can we order first?

	She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. 
	This does not stop Melvin.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		Two crab dinners and pitcher of 
		cold beer.
			(to Carol)
		Baked or fries?

				CAROL
		Fries.

				MELVIN
			(calling)
		One baked -- one fries.

				STARTLED WAITER
			(shouting back)
		I'll tell your waiter.

				MELVIN
			(to Carol)
		Okay, I got a real great 
		compliment for you and it's true.

				CAROL
		I am so afraid you're about to say 
		something awful... 

				MELVIN
		Don't be pessimistic. It's not 
		your style. Okay... Here I 
		goes... Clearly a mistake.
			(this is hell 
			for him)
		I have this -- what? Ailment... 
		And my doctor -- a shrink... who 
		I used to see all the time... he 
		says 50 or 60 percent of the time 
		a pill can really help. I hate 
		pills. Very dangerous things, 
		pills. "Hate," I am using the 
		word "hate" about pills. My 
		compliment is that when you came 
		to my house that time and told me 
		how you'd never -- well, you were 
		there, you know... The next 
		morning I started taking these 
		pills.

				CAROL
			(a little confused)
		I don't quite get how that's a 
		compliment for me.

	Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- 
	so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- 
	then:

				MELVIN
		You make me want to be a better 
		man.

	Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so 
	slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered, 
	momentarily moved and his for the taking.

				CAROL
		That's maybe the best compliment 
		of my life.

				MELVIN
		Then I've really overshot here 
		'cause I was aiming at just enough 
		to keep you from walking out.

	Carol laughs.

				CAROL
		So how are you doing with those 
		pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.

				MELVIN
		Takes months to know... They work 
		little by little.
			(holds his head; 
			then)
		Talking like this is exhausting.

	Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very 
	close -- he tenses.

				CAROL
		Have you ever let a romantic 
		moment make you do something you 
		know is stupid?

				MELVIN
		Never.

				CAROL
		Here's the trouble with never.

	TIGHT SHOT

	for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at 
	him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him 
	-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves 
	away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But 
	now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is 
	brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. 
	Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

				MELVIN
		You don't owe me that.

				CAROL
		That wasn't payment. When you 
		first came into breakfast, when I 
		saw you -- I thought you were 
		handsome... Then, of course, you 
		spoke... So now that your soft 
		li'l underbelly is all exposed. 
		Tell me, why did you bring me?

	Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable... 
	as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

				MELVIN
		Well, ah... that's a personal 
		question.

				CAROL
		Tell me even if you're scared. 
		Tell me why you wanted me here. 
		It's okay.

	She kisses him again.

				CAROL
		If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."

				MELVIN
			(dissembling)
		There are lots of reason... I had 
		a thought that if you had sex with 
		Simon it might... 

				CAROL
			(humiliated)
		Sex with Simon?

				MELVIN
		It's one idea... 

				CAROL
		That's why you brought me? Look 
		at me! Is that really why you 
		brought me... Like I'm a what and 
		I owe you what?!

				MELVIN
		I don't know why I brought you -- 
		that idea occurred to me is all... 
		It came out first... Hey, you kiss 
		him -- me... He says he loves 
		you. You two hit it off. But you 
		don't want to... fine... Forget 
		what I said about sex with Simon. 
		It was a mistake.

				CAROL
			(wiping away tears)
		I'll never forget you said it.

				MELVIN
		It was a mistake.

	But she has already turned away and exits the 
	restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.

	INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

	He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not 
	breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let 
	the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice, 
	then a humorless male voice:

				PARENTS' VOICE
			(humorless male 
			voice)
		Hi. This is Fred Bishop... 
			(perky woman's 
			voice)
		... and Betty.
			(Fred again)
		We are sorry to be unable to take 
		your call right now. Please leave 
		a message and we'd appreciate your 
		including the time/date and 
		purpose of your call.
			(Simon mouths the 
			word "date," then 
			Betty speaks before 
			the beep Bye-bye.

				SIMON
		Ah, this is Simon... I'm here in 
		town... 
			(he waits)
		... and, folks, you haven't come 
		home later than 10 in your lives. 
		Please pick up -- really... 
		Okay... I'm going to call again in 
		the morning. I need to see you. 
		Or, at least get you to answer the 
		phone.

	He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he 
	needs help.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she 
	goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing 
	things in.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT

				SIMON
		Hello... Hello???

	Carol thrusts open the door and enters... 

				SIMON
		Was this supposed to be your room?

				CAROL
		Our room. I don't want to see him 
		and he's not going to come 
		knocking on your door.

	Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, 
	inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

				SIMON
		Can you not be violent?

				CAROL
		I don't think so. You need help 
		with the pants?

				SIMON
			(emphatically)
		No!!!

				CAROL
		I'm going to take a big bath and 
		order a big meal.

				SIMON
		Uh-huh... 

				CAROL
		I'm sorry... are you okay?

				SIMON
		Well, considering everything's 
		horrible and tomorrow I have to 
		face my parents... Don't ask me
		... I'm sick of my own complaints
		... got to get me a new set of 
		thoughts.

				CAROL
		Why? What have you been thinking 
		about?

				SIMON
		How to die, mostly.

				CAROL
		Can you believe in our little mix 
		you're the good roommate.

	Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins 
	to prepare a bath.

				SIMON
			(turning off the light)
		Good night.

				CAROL
		Good night.

	We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or 
	sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he 
	faces the bathroom and we have... 

	SIMON'S POV

	Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now 
	as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair 
	-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast 
	exposed... 

	BACK TO SCENE

				SIMON
			(a whisper)
		Hold it.

	He leaves the bed.

	ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

	What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set 
	and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair 
	and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of 
	the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

				SIMON
		I've got to sketch you.

				CAROL
		No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer 
		than you think. I give the wrong 
		impression sometimes and... 

				SIMON
		I haven't even been thinking about 
		sketching for weeks.

				CAROL
		Stop staring. Do a vase.

				SIMON
		But you're beautiful... your skin 
		glows.

				CAROL
		Thanks. But I just want to take a 
		bath and... 

				SIMON
		That long neck -- the line of 
		you... you're porcelain... your 
		back goes on forever. You're 
		classic... you're why cavemen 
		chiseled on walls... 

				CAROL
		All right, cut me a break.

	Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him 
	earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly 
	but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right. 
	She's breathtaking.

	INT. BAR - NIGHT

	Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to 
	the bartender.

				MELVIN
		So then, the next thing I know, 
		she's sitting right next to me, 
		and then, well, it's not right to 
		go into the details, but I screwed 
		up. I got nervous. I said the 
		wrong thing and if I hadn't, I 
		could be in bed now with a woman 
		who if you could make her smile 
		you got a life. Instead, I'm here 
		with you, no offense, a moron 
		pushing the last legal drug.

	He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his 
	heart breaking.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT

	He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

				CAROL (O.S.)
		I don't care how you put it -- 
		We're being naughty here, pal.

	FULL SHOT

	Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a 
	ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His 
	style cramped by his cast.

				SIMON
		No. No. This is great, this is 
		so great. I can't get the angle 
		with this cast.

	He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle 
	no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece 
	from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically -- 
	a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

	The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better 
	than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

				MELVIN
		Did you have sex with her?

	Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the 
	hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.

				MELVIN
		Sorry, didn't realize she was 
		right there.
			(a beat)
		Did you have sex with her?

				CAROL
		To hell with sex.

	Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

				CAROL
		We held each other. It was better 
		than sex. What I need he gave me 
		great.

				SIMON
		I just love her.
			(beat)
		How're you doing?

	Melvin reacts.

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

	Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

				SIMON
		Hello, hi, Mom -- I can barely 
		hear you. Do you have to whisper? 
		No -- don't apologize -- it was 
		the luckiest thing for all of us 
		that you didn't answer last 
		night... I can't hear you... okay, 
		dear, just listen to me then.

	ON MELVIN AND CAROL

	Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings 
	the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in 
	her suitcase.

				MELVIN
		I get why you're angry. It's no 
		snap to explain why I was like 
		that, but let's not try to do it 
		on the run... 

				SIMON
		... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- 
		truly. A little odd that you 
		didn't come to see me when you 
		heard I was hurt, but the 
		important thing I want you to know 
		is your son is happy. I'm working 
		again. I'll make do -- I don't 
		want a thing. Wouldn't take it if 
		it was offered. I'll drop you a 
		note from wherever I land and then 
		it's up to you. I hope we patch 
		things up but know that if we 
		don't, I wish you both the very 
		best... I can't hear you. You 
		heard me, though, right? Good -- 
		take good care. 'Bye.

	He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over 
	to Carol and Melvin.

				MELVIN
		... Now he's going to want to 
		stay. And they'll want to take a 
		ride to the lake or whatever. So 
		it's a good five hours back. It 
		gives us a chance to take it easy 
		and... 

				SIMON
		I'm going back with you.

				CAROL
		But what about... 

				SIMON
		I'll take care of myself --

				MELVIN
		What are you talking about? You 
		got real problems.

				SIMON
		I know. I'm a little bit nervous. 
		Suddenly everything seems so easy. 
		Carol, a load has been lifted.

				CAROL
		One night with me!

				SIMON
		You think you're kidding.

	Melvin stalks out.

	EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

	The car parked near a phone booth --

				MELVIN
			(to Frank over 
			the phone)
		Aww Jesus! No choice.

	Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

				CAROL
		I got a gift for you.

	She hands him a base ball cap.

				MELVIN
			(on phone)
		Nothing like no choice to make you 
		feel at home.

				CAROL
			(to Simon)
		Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!

				MELVIN
		Do it then. Get the dog picked 
		up. I can't believe you let it 
		stay there.

	Melvin hangs up the phone.

				MELVIN
		Good-bye.
			(to Simon)
		Well, your luck is holding. They 
		sublet your place. You're 
		homeless. Frank's got a line on 
		another place you can use for now.

				SIMON
		Another place where?

				MELVIN
		Does it matter?

	Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a 
	special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it 
	PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

				CAROL
		I don't want to hear that music 
		right now.

				MELVIN
		What do you mean? You said you 
		liked it.

				CAROL
		I don't.

				MELVIN
		This one has a special meaning.

				CAROL
		It's your car but I don't want to 
		hear it. If that means anything.

	Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-
	proclamation of love.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

	As the car arrives... They get out... 

				MELVIN
		Here are the keys to my apartment. 
		I'm going to park you in my place 
		while I take Carol home.

				CAROL
			(hefting bag)
		I'll take a bus.

				MELVIN
		I'll take you... why not?

				CAROL
		I don't care what you did for me. 
		I don't think I want to know you 
		anymore -- all you do is make me 
		feel badly about myself.
			(turning to Simon)
		You have my number.

				SIMON
			(hugging her)
		I love you... 
			(sotto)
		Let him take you home.

				CAROL
		Don't want to. I love you.

	She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at 
	Melvin with some sympathy.

				MELVIN
		Don't say anything.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

	Where Verdell's ears prick.

	INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As they enter.

				MELVIN (O.S.)
		I told you to go on in.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Look, I've got to get a hold of 
		Frank and see where I'm hanging my 
		hat 'cause... 

	The door opens, revealing them:

				MELVIN
		I think you gotta camp it here... 

				SIMON
		What are you talking about?

	The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the 
	dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

				SIMON
			(to Verdell)
		I know the feeling -- you feel 
		like your ol' self again, huh? --
		Mommy and Daddy are home.

	Melvin reacts.

				SIMON
		Sorry... You're fun to mess with.
	
	Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

				MELVIN
		They took your place furnished. 
		Jackie said she grabbed your 
		personal stuff -- they were 
		supposed to set you up here.
			(leading the way)
		There's this extra room -- I 
		never use. It gets good light. 
		No other answer really.

	Simon follows.

	INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

	As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small 
	but lovely garret.

				SIMON
		Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm 
		me.

				MELVIN
		They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?

				SIMON
		I love you.

	Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

				MELVIN
		I'll tell you, buddy, I'd be the 
		luckiest guy alive if that did it 
		for me.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and 
	Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each 
	around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully 
	dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we 
	hear Simon's whispered voice.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Where is my big hairy boy?

	Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest 
	approaches.

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Verdell, sweeties?

	Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

				SIMON
		Sorry, didn't know you were awake. 
		I just thought Verdell shouldn't 
		get too used to sleeping in here 
		'cause then... 

				MELVIN
		Look, we both want the dog -- 
		and... 

	The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin 
	doesn't move.

				SIMON
		Should I get it?

	Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several 
	beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

				SIMON (O.S.)
		Hello.

	ON SIMON

				SIMON
			(into phone)
		Hello. It's me. He took me in. 
		Did you know? Hold on, I'll get 
		him for you.

	He walks back to Melvin's room.

	INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

	As he enters.

				SIMON
		It's Carol.

	Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one 
	mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.

				MELVIN
		Here. Take the dog.

	As he speeds him out... 

				SIMON
		Good luck.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat 
	loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin 
	-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat 
	clearing.

				MELVIN
		Hello.

				CAROL
		Yeah... Well... 

				MELVIN
			(very concerned)
		How you doing?

				CAROL
		I can trust my brain.

				MELVIN
		That seems like a good choice.

				CAROL
		I don't know whether I'm being 
		sensible or hard on you.

				MELVIN
		The two might go together.

				CAROL
		See. There's an example. I don't 
		know whether you're being cute or 
		crazy now.

				MELVIN
			(what the hell)
		Cute.

				CAROL
		You don't have to answer 
		everything I say. Just listen to 
		me. Okay?

	He nods his head, "yes."

				CAROL
		It's really something that you're 
		looking after Simon. And what I 
		said on the street. That was a 
		bad thing to say. And it made me 
		sick to my stomach. It was a bad 
		thing to say. And I'd be lying if 
		I didn't say that I enjoyed your 
		company... but the truth is you do 
		bother me enormously and I know -- 
		think -- that it's best for me to 
		not have contact with you because 
		you're just not ready and you're a 
		pretty old guy to not be ready... 
		and I'm too old to ignore that. 
		But there were extraordinary 
		kindnesses that did take place. 
		So thanks for the trips... 

	She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than 
	ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

				MELVIN
		Okay to say something now?

				CAROL
		Go ahead.

				MELVIN
		I should've danced with you.

				CAROL
		Okay. Good-bye.

				MELVIN
		So long.

	Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped. 
	Oh, hell... she missed him.

	INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He 
	is impatient.

				MELVIN
		You going to come talk to me or 
		not?

				SIMON
		I'm coming.

	We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be 
	allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

				SIMON
		What did she say?

				MELVIN
		I'm a great guy -- 
		"extraordinary"... 
			(before Simon can 
			celebrate)
		... and she doesn't want contact 
		with me.
			(a beat)
		I'm dying here.

				SIMON
		Because... 
			(gently)
		... you love her?

				MELVIN
			(sharply)
		No... and you're supposed to be 
		sensitive and sharp.

				SIMON
		Okay... you tell me why --
			(mimics him)
		"You're dying here."

				MELVIN
		I don't know... Let me sleep on it 
		and figure it out.
			(then)
		Because I'm stuck! Can't go back 
		to what I had... She's evicted me 
		from my life.

				SIMON
		Did you like it that much?

				MELVIN
			(furiously)
		It was better than this... Look, 
		you, I'm very intelligent. If 
		you're going to give me advice or 
		conversation or consolation or 
		hope, you got to be better than 
		you're doing. If you can't be at 
		least momentarily interesting than 
		shut the hell up. I'm drowning 
		and you're describing water.

				SIMON
			(getting pissed)
		Picking on me won't help.

				MELVIN
		Well, if that's true then I'm 
		really in trouble.

				SIMON
		But you know where you're lucky?

				MELVIN
		Absolutely not.

				SIMON
		You know who you want. I'll take 
		your seat any day. So do 
		something... don't sleep on it... 
		go over there. I don't think 
		anybody should ever sleep on 
		anything -- it's not always good 
		to let things calm down.

				MELVIN
		Hey... I'm charged here. But she 
		might kill me for showing up this 
		late.

				SIMON
		Then get in your jammies and I'll 
		read you a story... I think you've 
		got a chance. The only real enemy 
		you have is her ability to think 
		logically -- the best thing you 
		have going for you is your 
		willingness to humiliate yourself 
		if it gives you one chance in 
		whatever -- so go catch her off-
		guard.

				MELVIN
		Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.

	He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

				SIMON
		What's wrong?

				MELVIN
		I forgot to lock the door.

	EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) - 
	NIGHT

	As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at 
	his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the 
	apartment house.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great 
	uncertainty.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting 
	directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading 
	one of Melvin's books... 

	There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL... 
	someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly 
	-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL -- 
	until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to 
	her wide open window and looks over.

	HER POV

	The convertible at the curb.

	BACK TO SCENE

	She hesitates --

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

	As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the 
	sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. 
	He bolts for the door and enters.

	INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN 
	SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

				CAROL
		What do you want, Melvin?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What do you want?

				MELVIN
		'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm 
		sorry. And you could be grouchy.

				CAROL
		Grouchy?

				MELVIN
		... 'Cause of being woken up, and 
		it would make my job impossible. 
		So then I wouldn't even try.

				CAROL
		What job?

				MELVIN
		Were you asleep?

				CAROL
		What are you doing here?

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Beverly in the hallway looking on --

	BACK TO SCENE

				MELVIN
		I'm sorry I woke you -- some other 
		time.

	He half turns to leave.

				CAROL
		I wasn't asleep!!

				MELVIN
		What a break... 

				CAROL
			(losing it a bit)
		Is it a secret what you're doing 
		here?

				MELVIN
		I had to see you... 

				CAROL
		Because... 

				MELVIN
		It relaxes me... I'd feel better 
		just sitting on the curb in front 
		of your house than anyplace else 
		I can think of or imagine.

	Carol has not ever heard anything like that before... 
	it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her 
	door down the hallway, has heard at least this last 
	part... 

	Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone... 

				MELVIN
			(serious)
		Wait a minute, I'm overstating 
		here, maybe the inside stairs. I 
		don't want to sit with my feet in 
		the gutter. What does that serve? 
		It only... 

	But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

				CAROL
		Stop it!! Why can't I have a 
		normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out 
		of here. Just a regular boyfriend 
		who doesn't go nuts on me... 

				BEVERLY
			(butting in)
		Everybody wants that, dear -- it 
		doesn't exit... 
			(as Carol turns 
			to her)
		Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.

	She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh -- 
	gathers herself. A beat.

				MELVIN
			(hopefully)
		Boyfriend?

				CAROL
		Oh, come on in and try not to ruin 
		everything by being you.

				MELVIN
		Maybe we could live without the 
		wise cracks.

	She looks at him -- then:

				CAROL
		Maybe we could... 

	Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen 
	linoleum and stalls at the door.

				MELVIN
		It feels a little confined here. 
		Let's take a walk.

				CAROL
		See. It's four in the morning. A 
		walk sounds a little screwy to me, 
		if you don't mind.

				MELVIN
		If you need an excuse, there's a 
		bakery on the corner. There's a 
		shot it'll open soon -- that way 
		we're not screwy -- we're just 
		two people who like warm rolls.

				CAROL
		Okay.

	EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

	They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual 
	attention to where he steps.

	CAROL'S POV

	Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement -- 
	it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids 
	stepping on the lines.

	BACK TO SCENE

	Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing 
	down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious 
	-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

				CAROL
			(gently; almost 
			lovingly)
		I'm sorry, Melvin -- but whatever 
		this is -- is not going to work.

	ON MELVIN

	He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper 
	something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his 
	history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

				MELVIN
		I'm feeling... I've been feeling 
		better.

				CAROL
		Melvin, even though it may seem 
		that way now -- you don't know me 
		all that well... 
			(as he scoffs)
		I'm not the answer for you.

	She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns 
	back to him.

				MELVIN
		Hey, I've got a great compliment 
		for you.

				CAROL
		You know what? I... 

				MELVIN
		Just let me talk.
			(gathers himself 
			with uncertainty, 
			then:)
		I'm the only one on the face of 
		the earth who realizes that you're 
		the greatest woman on earth. I'm 
		the only one who appreciates how 
		amazing you are in every single 
		thing you do -- in every single 
		thought you have... in how you 
		are with Spencer -- Spence... 
			(he has reached 
			her)
		... in how you say what you mean 
		and how you almost always mean 
		something that's all about being 
		straight and good... 

	ON CAROL

	She stands on the precipice of being transported away 
	from the logic which has been her lifeline.

				MELVIN
		I think most people miss that 
		about you and I watch wondering 
		how they can watch you bring them 
		food and clear their dishes and 
		never get that they have just met 
		the greatest woman alive... And 
		the fact that I get it makes me 
		feel great... about me!
			(a real question 
			filled with 
			concern for her)
		You got a real good reason to walk 
		out on that?

	That last question clearly a true question, not the least 
	rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

				CAROL
		No! It's certainly not. No -- I 
		don't think so. No.

				MELVIN
			(tentatively)
		I'm gonna grab you.
			(with conviction)
		I didn't mean it to be a question. 
		I'm gonna grab you.

	He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate. 
	A tense beat. Then:

				MELVIN
		I know I can do better.

	They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A 
	first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot 
	land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his 
	knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a 
	notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in 
	unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a 
	path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the 
	bakery turn on as it opens for business.

				CAROL
		Warm rolls... 

	They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As 
	they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to 
	clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto 
	a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous 
	fact and joins Carol inside as we:

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT

               GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

               ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED 
               HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY

               CAT.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face always unseen)
                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world 
                         hostage has failed.  Again.  This 
                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and 
               smoking.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mustafa...

               ANGLE ON:  MUSTAFA, an Arab with a red Fez.

                                     DR. EVIL

                         I spared your lives because I need 
                         you to help me rid the world of the 
                         only man who can stop me now.  We 
                         must go to London.  I've set a trap 
                         for Austin Powers!

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

               (PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR 
               FREEZE FRAMES À LA SWEET CHARITY.)

               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (taking photos)
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me baby.  Smashing!

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.  
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No.  No.

               Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm 
               spent.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get these off to Fab Magazine right 
                         away.

                                     SUPERMODEL 1
                         Austin, you've really outdone yourself 
                         this time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks, baby.

                                     SUPERMODEL 2
                              (suggestively)
                         We could have another photo session 
                         back at my flat.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (coyly)
                         Oh, behave!

                                     SUPERMODEL 3
                         Austin, I love you!

                                     AUSTIN
                         So many women, so little time.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

                                     MOD GIRL 1
                         It's Austin Powers!

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH

               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY

               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH

               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP

               Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS.  The fourth 
               panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You might want to protest a bit louder 
                         next time, luv.

               The both laugh.

               2L  FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT

               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF 
               SCHOOLGIRLS.

               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing 
               off just ahead of the crowd.

               EXT./INT.  JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

               The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, 
               a beautiful woman in her thirties.

               They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING 
                         RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a 
                         distinctive PHONE RING.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief 
                         of British Intelligence.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.  
               ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a 
               distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  "Basil 
               Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence."

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin.  This is Basil 
                         Exposition, Chief of British 
                         Intelligence.

               You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're 
               with Agent

               Mrs. Kensington.  The year is 1967, and you're talking on a 
               picture phone.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We know all that, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I just wanted to be extremely clear 
                         so that everyone knows what's going 
                         on at any given time.  We've just 
                         received word that Dr. Evil, the 
                         ultimate square, is planning to take 
                         over the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in 
                         jail for good.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week, 
                         Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel 
                         Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's 
                         planning a trap for you tonight at 
                         the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat 
                         Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus 
                         here in swinging London.

               A panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing 
               Austin's position and the location of the club.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Just where you'd never think to look 
                         for him.  We'll be there.

                         Good luck, Austin.

                                     QUEEN
                         Austin Powers, Britain owes you a 
                         debt of gratitude.

               Austin gives a cheeky look to Mrs. Kensington.

                                     QUEEN
                         I understand you were wounded.  Where 
                         were you hit?

                                     AUSTIN
                         In the but-tocks.

                                     QUEEN
                         That must be a sight.  I'd kind of 
                         like to see that.

               Austin turns around, drops his pants, and shows his wounded 
               bum (matching Gump's) to the queen.

               The queen walks away.

                                     QUEEN
                              (laughing)
                         Nice buttocks.

               In the line-up we also see FOREST GUMP.  He has to pee very 
               badly.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         We've got to find Dr. Evil!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I've got an idea.

               He PUNCHES a PRETTY MOD GIRL in the face, knocking her out 
               cold.

                                     EVERYONE
                         Ohhh!

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin, why in God's name did you 
                         strike that woman?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That ain't no woman!  It's a man, 
                         man.  It's one of Dr. Evil's 
                         assassins.

               Austin pulls off the mod girl's wig.  She is a MALE ASSASSIN.  
               The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.

               Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin 
               hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington 
               kicks the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a 
               head-lock from behind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where's Doctor Evil?

               ANGLE ON:  A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE 
               FINGER PULLS THE TRIGGER OF A SPEAR

               gun.  The assassin falls forward.  A spear protrudes from 
               his back.  Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door.  
               They give chase.

               INT.  CLUB - BACK ROOM

               They enter.  Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you again, Dr. Evil!

               The chair fills with a WHITE MIST.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unseen, through mist)
                         Not this time.  Come, Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!
                              (calling out)
                         See you in the future, Mr. Powers!

               Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair.  
               A sign on the egg reads "CRYOGENIC

               FREEZING BEGINNING."

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         My God!  He's freezing himself.

               Austin begins FIRING at the egg chair.  The ceiling opens up 
               and the egg rises through the opening.  Everything begins to 
               RUMBLE.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling.

               The Bob's Big Boy rocket begins to LIFT OFF.

               Bigglesworth is pressed to the window like one of those 
               stuffed Garfields.

                         Austin Powers volunteered to have

                              (waiting)
                         Complete!  The cryogenic state of 
                         Austin Powers is now completed.

               Austin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle à la Dr. 
               Frankenstein's lab.  NURSE TECHNICIANS administer injections 
               and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors.

                                     AUSTIN

                         Where am I?

                         You're in the Ministry of Defense.  
                         It's 1997.  You've been cryogenically 
                         frozen for thirty years.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (shouting)

                         The shouting is a temporary side-
                         effect of the unfreezing process.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I'm having trouble 
                         controlling&emdash;

                         You might also experience a slight 
                         fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at 
                         moments of extreme relaxation.  
                         Austin, this is Commander Gilmour,

                                     AUSTIN
                         Russian Intelligence?  Are you mad?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         A lot's happened since you were 
                         frozen, Austin.  The cold war's over.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank God.  Those capitalist dogs 
                         will finally pay for their crimes 
                         against the people,

               hey Comrades?

                         Mr. Powers, the President's very 
                         concerned.  We've got a madman on

                         When do I begin?

                         Ms. Kensington.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You mean Mrs. Kensington?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         No, Austin, Mrs. Kensington has long-
                         since retired.  Ms. Kensington is 
                         her daughter.

               VANESSA KENSINGTON, Mrs. Kensington's daughter, beautiful, 
               mid-Twenties, English, enters.  She is wearing a very 
               conservative, business pantsuit.  Her hair is up and she 
               wears glasses.  Austin's breath is taken away.

               She sets down a huge stack of files.

                              (out loud, to himself)
                         My God, Vanessa's got a smashing 
                         body.  I bet she shags like a minx.  
                         How do I tell them that because of 
                         the unfreezing process, I have no 
                         inner monologue?
                              (pause)
                         I hope I didn't say that out loud 
                         just now.

               There is an uncomfortable SILENCE.

                                     VANESSA
                         Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate 
                         you to the Nineties.  You know, a 
                         lot's changed since 1967.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, as long as people are still 
                         having promiscuous sex with many 
                         anonymous partners without protection, 
                         while at the same time experimenting 
                         with mind-expanding

               drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a 
               pound.

                                     VANESSA
                         My mother's told me all about you.

                                     AUSTIN
                         If it's a lie, goddamn her.  It it's 
                         the truth, goddamn me.
                              (pause)
                         God, I hope that's witty.  How's 
                         your mum?

                                     VANESSA
                         My mother's doing quite well, thank 
                         you very much.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Yes, well...Agent Kensington will 
                         get you set up.  She's very dedicated.  
                         Perhaps, a little too dedicated.
                              (aside to Austin)
                         She's got a bit of a bug up her ass.  
                         Good luck, Austin, the world's 
                         depending on you.

                         We have to leave immediately.  We've 
                         preserved your private jet just as

               The inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet&emdash; rust shag 
               carpet, brown walls, and beads.  Austin and Vanessa sit on 
               beanbag chairs.  Vanessa works on her lap top.

                         Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How 
                         does a hot chick like you end up 
                         working at the Ministry of Defense?

                         I went to Oxford and excelled in 
                         several subjects, but I ended up 
                         specializing in foreign languages.  
                         I wanted to travel -- see the world.  
                         In my last year I was accepted into 
                         the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies 
                         sector.  I thought I was off on an 
                         exciting career, but my job was to 
                         read everything printed in every 
                         country.  It's very boring.  My whole 
                         day is spent reading wedding 
                         announcements in Farsi.  If I do 
                         well with this case, I finally get 
                         promoted to field operative...

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, 
                         why don't we go into the back and 
                         shag?

                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         man, I want to see if my bits and 
                         pieces are still working.

                         I'm sorry?

                         Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you 
                         must be a little confused, but we 
                         have a very serious situation at 
                         hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd 
                         concentrate on our mission and give 
                         your libido a rest.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

                                     VANESSA
                         A Chigro?

                                     AUSTIN
                         You know, a Chigro&emdash; part 
                         Chinese, part Negro&emdash; Chigro.

                                     VANESSA
                              (offended)
                         We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.  
                         It's considered offensive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's right.  You're supposed to 
                         say 'colored' now, right?
                              (spotting the flight 
                              attendants)
                         Here's the stewardesses!  Bring on 
                         the sexy stews!

               The STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily.  
               One of them is a man and another wears braces.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?  
                         We're called 'flight attendants' 
                         now, thank you very much.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a 
                         whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         My name is Mrs. Wilkenson.  There 
                         are a few things we need to discuss.  
                         First of all, we're not wearing these.

               She holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits.

               FLIGHT ATTENDANT

               ALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY.  IT SAYS 
               HERE, '4:30 - DINNER, 5:30 -

               Everyone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Seems pretty straightforward, don't 
                         you think...listen darling, I think 
                         you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get 
                         your telephone number?

                                     FLGHT ATTENDANT
                              (mock sexy)
                         Sure, it's easy to remember.
                              (writing on his hand)
                         It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare 
                         the craft for take-off now.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing!  When we land I'll give 
                         you a tinkle on the telling bone.

               The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's 
                         two things I know about life: one, 
                         Americans will never take to soccer.  
                         Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses 
                         love to shag!

               They're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, 
               and be honest.

                                     VANESSA
                         Sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?

                                     VANESSA
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?  Randy, you 
                         know.  To you, am I eros manifest?

                                     VANESSA
                         I hope this is part of the unfreezing 
                         process.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash; 
                         that's what I do, I swing.

                                     VANESSA
                         I understand that, Mr. Powers, but 
                         let me be perfectly clear with you, 
                         perhaps to the point of being 
                         insulting.  I will never have sex 
                         with you, ever.  If you were the 
                         last man on Earth and I was the last 
                         woman on Earth, and the future of 
                         the human race depended on our having 
                         sex simply for procreation, I still 
                         would not have sex with you.

               Austin is oblivious.

                                     AUSTIN
                         What's you point, Vanessa?

               EXT.  PLANE IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

               Austin's plane.  Time has passed.

               IINT. PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

               Vanessa's lap-top BEEPS.

                                     COMPUTER VOICE
                         You've got mail!

               ANGLE ON:  the computer screen.  It's Basil Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Hello Austin.  Hello Vanessa.  This 
                         is Basil Exposition, from British 
                         Intelligence.

               There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think 
               may be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives 
               gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's 
               the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat 
               rooms.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Oh, and Austin&emdash;

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

               Vanessa closes her lap-top.

                                     PILOT
                              (over loudspeaker)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, we're beginning 
                         our final descent into Las Vegas 
                         International Airport.  Flight 
                         attendants will be coming by to 
                         collect your drinks, and I'll ask 
                         you at this time to please return to 
                         the main cabin and put your

               bean-bags in the upright position.

               Austin and Vanessa fasten the seatbelts on their bean bags.

               EXT.  AIRPLANE LANDING - NIGHT

               We see a plane's lights landing at night.

               ZOOM CUT TO:

               INT.  PSYCHEDELIC SCENE BREAK

               MUSIC:  Psychedelic Wa-wa Pedal Funky Drummer Beat TITLE 
               GRAPHIC:  The Trip Using a sequence of snap-zooms, colored 
               projections, and flashing lights, we see Austin dance crazily 
               à la BOB FOSSE with a GO-GO GIRL in a bikini with the Austin 
               Powers logo body-painted on her midriff.

               The sequence lasts five seconds and is very groovy.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS MONTAGE - NIGHT

               Sights and sounds of Las Vegas icons at night:  "Welcome to 
               Las Vegas" sign.  Luxor.  The giant cowboy whose arm waves.  
               Caesar's Palace.  The montage ends on the modern skyline of 
               Las Vegas.

               GRAPHIC:  1997, SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face again unseen)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a 
                         long time, but I'm back.  It's all 
                         gone perfectly to plan except for 
                         one small flaw.  Because of a 
                         technical error, my right arm was 
                         not frozen.  I was therefore by 
                         definition only partially frozen.

               ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty, 
               eyes darting left and right.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But my design was perfect!  Your 
                         autonomic functions were shut down, 
                         and even though your arm wasn't 
                         frozen, the aging was retarded, 
                         therefore your right arm is only 
                         slightly older than the left.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Can't you see I'm only half a man?  
                         Look at me, I'm a freak!

               He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But Dr. Evil, all you need to do 
                         is&emdash;
                              (holding up tennis 
                              ball)
                         --work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze 
                         it for twenty minutes a day.  A few 
                         months of that and it'll be just as 
                         strong as the other arm...

                                     DR. EVIL
                         And look what you've done to Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!

               ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

               who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair 
               around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         We could not anticipate feline 
                         complications due to the reanimation 
                         process&emdash;

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face unseen)
                         Silence!

               ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT

               Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he 
               falls backwards into a pit.

                                     MUSTAFA
                              (blood-curdling scream)
                         Ahhhhhhhhh!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face unseen)
                         Let this be a reminder to you all 
                         that this organization will not 
                         tolerate failure.

               MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY

               ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY 
               FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS

               scar on his cheek.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

               More muffled SCREAMS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We've got a lot of work to do.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         Someone help me!  I'm still alive, 
                         only I'm very badly burned.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (slightly distracted)
                         Some of you I know, some of you I'm 
                         meeting for the first time.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone 
                         call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a 
                         lot of pain.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (very frustrated)
                         You've all been gathered here to 
                         form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me.

               He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)

               It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room.

                         charms!

               Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face.

                         It's a long story.

                         Finally, I come to my number two 
                         man.  His name:  Number Two.

               NUMBER TWO, a good-looking 40-year-old man with an eye-patch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         For thirty years, Number Two has run 
                         Virtucon, the legitimate face of my 
                         evil empire.

               He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to 
               reveal a large, illuminated map of the United States dotted 
               by various miniature models.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Over the last thirty years, Virtucon 
                         has grown by leaps and bounds.  About 
                         fifteen years ago, we changed from 
                         volatile chemicals to the 
                         communication industry.  We own cable 
                         companies in thirty-eight states.

               The thirty-eight states illuminate on the map.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         In addition to our cable holdings, 
                         we own a steel mill in Cleveland.

               A steel mill miniature illuminates in Cleveland.

                         And a factory in Chicago that makes 
                         miniature models of factories.

               The miniature model factory lights up in Chicago.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         We also own the Franklin mint, which 
                         makes decorative hand-painted theme 
                         plates for collectors.
                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called 
                         blackmail.  The Royal Family of 
                         Britain are the wealthiest landowners 
                         in the world.  Either the Royal Family 
                         pays us an exorbitant amount of money, 
                         or we make it look like Prince 
                         Charles, the heir to the throne, has 
                         had an affair outside of marriage 
                         and, therefore, they would have to 
                         divorce.

               There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did 
                         have an affair.  He admitted it, and 
                         they are now divorced, actually.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         People have to tell me these things.  
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         throw me a bone here.
                              (pausing)
                         OK, no problem.  Here's my second 
                         plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a 
                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               There is another uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Umm, that also has already happened.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         Oh, hell, let's just do what we always 
                         do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons 
                         and hold the world hostage.
                              (pause)
                         Gentlemen, it's come to my attention 
                         that a breakaway Russian Republic 
                         called Kreplachistan will be 
                         transferring a nuclear warhead to 
                         the United Nations in a few days.  
                         Here's the plan.  We get the warhead, 
                         and we hold the world ransom...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is an uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't you think we should ask for 
                         more than a million dollars?  A 
                         million dollars isn't that much money 
                         these days.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         All right then...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is another uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Virtucon alone makes over nine billion 
                         dollars a year.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pleasantly surprised)
                         Oh, really?
                              (slightly irritated)
                         One-hundred billion dollars.
                              (pause)
                         OK, make it happen.  Anything else?

                         Remember when we froze your semen, 
                         you said that if it looked like you 
                         weren't coming back to try and make 
                         you a son so that a part of you would 
                         live forever?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes.

                         Well, after a few years, we got sort 
                         of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you 
                         to meet your son.

                         I haven't seen you my whole life and 
                         now you show up and want a

                         You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing!

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a 
                         secure cellular phone, an on-board 
                         computer, and a Global Geosynchronous 
                         Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, 
                         this.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various 
               dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, 
               dental mirror, and cleaning tool.

                         Let me guess.  The floss is garotte 
                         wire, the toothpaste contains plastic 
                         explosives, and the toothbrush is 
                         the detonation device.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, actually.  I don't know how to 
                         put this really.  Well, there have 
                         been fabulous advances in the field 
                         of dentistry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why?  What's wrong with my teeth?

               EXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

               The Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door.

               INT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

               Vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin 
               takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite 
               suitcases.

                                     AUSITN
                         Which side of the bed do you want?

                                     VANESSA
                         You're going to sleep on the sofa.  
                         I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, 
                         that the only reason we're sharing a 
                         room is to support our cover story 
                         that we're a married couple on 
                         vacation.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, shall we shag now, or shall we 
                         shag later?  How do you like to do 
                         it?  Do you like to wash up first?  
                         Top and tails?  A whore's bath?  
                         Personally, before I'm on the job, I 
                         like to give my undercarriage a bit 
                         of a how's-your-father.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (off her angry reaction)
                         I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to 
                         get a rise out of you.

               They both laugh.

                                     VANESSA
                         Let's unpack.

               HER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents.  
               All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, nerd alert.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington 
               shaver with huge English plug.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel 
               iron and a Braun blow drier.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle 
               of Jurgens lotion.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a 
               plastic baggie marked "Underthings" and her shoes in a baggie 
               marked "Shoes."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and 
               Hai Karate cologne.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - 
               Top Secret."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump.  
               Vanessa sees it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's 
                         playing a prank on me!  Honestly, 
                         this isn't mine.

                                     VANESSA
                              (suffering)
                         I'm sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think I'll give that stew a ding-a-
                         ling.

               Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm.  
               After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the 
               handset.

                                     MOVIE PHONE VOICE
                              (through handset)
                         Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM!

               Austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to Vanessa.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got her answering machine.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa walk through the casino.  Austin gives 
               PEOPLE two-handed handshakes.  They stare like he's a freak.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love Las Vegas, man.  Oh, I forgot 
                         my x-ray glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                         Here, use mine.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to use a cover name.  It's 
                         important that it be a generic name 
                         so that we don't draw attention to 
                         ourselves.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table.  Number Two 
               is there, complete with eyepatch.  On one side of him is a 
               beautiful ITALIAN WOMAN (a la SOPHIA LOREN) in a white dress 
               with a white kerchief on her head.  On the other side of him 
               is an extremely large-breasted BIMBO.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do you mind if I join you?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Not at all.

               The DEALER deals.

                                     DEALER
                         Seventeen.

               Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch.

               NUMBER TWO'S MONOCULAR POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  We see everyone at the casino 
               in their underwear.  He looks at the next card in the shoe.  
               It is a 4.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hit me.

                                     DEALER
                         You have seventeen, sir.  The book 
                         says not to, sir.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I like to live dangerously.

               The dealer draws a card from the card shoe.

                                     DEALER
                         Four.  Twenty-one.

               Everyone at the table applauds.  The dealer deals to Austin 
               and Number Two.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Eighteen.
                              (to Number Two)
                         Sixteen.

               NUMBER TWO'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  He looks at the shoe at the 
               shoe and sees that the next card is a ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I'll stay.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

               Smugly, Austin puts on Vanessa's x-ray glasses.

               AUSTIN'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY SPECS".  Everyone is in their underwear, 
               but it is completely blurry.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

                                     VANESSA
                              (quietly)
                         What's wrong?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (quietly, to Vanessa)
                         I can't see a bloody thing.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're 
                         prescription X-ray glasses.  I have 
                         very bad astigmatism.

                                     DEALER
                         Sir, the table is waiting.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (panicking)
                         Uh, hit me.

               The table MURMURS.

                                     DEALER
                         On an eighteen, sir?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I also like to live dangerously.

               The dealer deals him the ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         You're very brave.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow 
                         myself to introduce...myself.  My 
                         name is Ritchie Cunningham.

               Vanessa is mortified.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (indicating Vanessa)
                         This is my wife, Enid.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My name is Number Two.

               He extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but 
               misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an 
               awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                              (rescuing him)
                         Number Two?  That's an unusual name.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My parents were hippies.
                              (indicating Italian 
                              woman)
                         This is my Italian confidential 
                         secretary.

                                     ITALIAN WOMAN
                              (Italian accent)
                         My name is Alotta
                              (quickly)
                         Alotta Fagina.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.  
                         It sounds like you're saying your 
                         name is a lot of...never mind.  
                         Listen, cats, I'm going to crash.  
                         It's been a gas.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Peace, baby.

               Austin and Vanessa leave.

               INT.  CASINO

                                     VANESSA
                         Why did you leave so soon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That cat Number Two has an X-ray 
                         eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, 
                         man.  Listen, we should go back to 
                         the room, but first I have to go to 
                         the naughty chair and see a man about 
                         a dog.

               He heads to the rest room.

               INT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO

               Number Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON.

               INT.  BATHROOM - CASINO

               Austin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy 
               hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining 
               stall.

                                     TEXAN
                         Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy 
                         food, you rent it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Too right, youth.

               INT.  BATHROOM STALL

               Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing 
               Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks 
               back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it 
               around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the 
               wire and certain death.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (grunting)
                         Uh, uh!

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about 
               frantically.  He can hear the

               GRUNTING.

                                     TEXAN
                         Hey pardner, just relax, don't force 
                         it!  Use some creative visualization.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's 
               crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony.

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (groaning)
                         Ughhhhh...

               Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty 
               O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it 
               hovers above the toilet bowl.

                         Who does Number Two work for?

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (quietly, straining)
                         Go to hell.

               Austin drops Patty's head into the toilet and FLUSHES.  We 
               hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O'Brien.

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin reaches into Patty O'Brien's wallet.  We see his Dr. 
               Evil ID card and Alotta's Virtucon business card with her 
               address.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin is leaving his stall.  The Texan can see Patty 
               O'Brien's dead body head-first in the toilet.

                                     TEXAN

               ANGLE ON THE FLOOR OF AUSTIN'S STALL

               Patty O'Brien's lifeless hand hits the floor.  The charms 
               come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover.  A 
               second later, a blue diamond falls out.

               Vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos 
               and files on Dr. Evil, Virtucon, etc.

               In the background, through an open door, we see that Austin 
               is asleep on the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                              (into phone)
                         Hello Mum?

               INT.  MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE - LONDON

               An older Mrs. Kensington sits in her suburban English front 
               room.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                              (on phone)
                         Oh, hello Vanessa.  How was the 
                         flight?

                                     VANESSA (V.O.)
                         Great.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         How's Austin?

                                     VANESSA (V.O.)
                         He's asleep.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         You didn't...

               INT.  HOTEL SUITE

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the 
                         couch.

               In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is 
               very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of 
               flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I'm proud of you.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         Because you managed to resist Austin 
                         Power's charms.

               Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.  
               Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number 
               Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, God knows he tried, but I've 
                         been rather firm with him, Mummy.  
                         You didn't tell me he was so obsessed 
                         with sex.  It's bizarre.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         You can't judge him by modern 
                         standards.  He's very much a product 
                         of his times.  In my day he could 
                         have any woman he wanted.

                                     VANESSA
                         What about his teeth?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         You have to understand, in Britain 
                         in the Sixties you could be a sex 
                         symbol and still have bad teeth.  It 
                         didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         I just don't see it.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in 
                         his charms, it's impossible to get 
                         out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever...

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Of course not.  I was married to 
                         your father.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever want to?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin is very charming, very 
                         debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has 
                         a knowledge of fine wines, 
                         sophisticated, a world-renowned 
                         photographer.  Women want hin, men 
                         want to be him.  He's a lover of 
                         love&emdash; every bit an 
                         International Man of Mystery.

               We hear the TOILET FLUSH.  Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the 
               screen.

               Austin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa 
               holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and 
               in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera.

                                     VANESSA
                         You didn't answer my question, Mum.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I know.  Let me just say this: Austin 
                         was the most loyal and caring friend 
                         I ever had.

               I will always love him.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)

                              (to her mother)
                         Do you want to talk to him?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         No, it's been too long.  Best to 
                         leave things alone.

                                     VANESSA

                              (to her mother)
                         Look, I'd better go.  I love you.

                         I love you, Vanessa.

               Vanessa hangs up.  Austin enters wearing an "Austin Powers" 
               robe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Good morning, Vanessa!  I hope you 
                         have on clean underwear.

                         Let me tell you a story.  There's 
                         these two bulls on top of a hill 
                         checking out some foxy cows in the 
                         meadow below.  The young bull says, 
                         'hey, why don't we run down the hill 
                         and shag us a cow?', and the wise 
                         old bull replies, 'no, why don't we 
                         walk down the hill and shag all the 
                         cows?'

                         I don't get it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, you know...cows, and shagging.

                         Unfortunately, while you told that 
                         stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No worries, luv.  We'll just give 
                         Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

               He notices the way the desert light catches her beauty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly 
                         beautiful.  Stay right where you 
                         are.

               Austin changes lenses and begins SNAPPING PICTURES.

                                     VANESSA
                         I hate having my picture taken.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're crazy.  The camera loves you, 
                         Vanessa.

               Vanessa does a few coy poses.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Go, Vanessa, go!

               Vanessa lets go a little bit more.

               WHITE CYC

               Austin and Vanessa are in the midst of a full professional 
               photo shoot, and she's loving it.

               Austin begins SNAPPING pictures, all the while changing her 
               look, touching her hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me Vanessa.  Smashing!  Crazy.  
                         Give me some shoulder.
                              (pause)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

               He motions to her two top buttons of her blouse.  She nods 
               no.  Austin nods yes.  She sheepishly undoes them.  A MONTAGE 
               of her in various gowns, one more exotic and exciting than 
               the other.

                         Smashing!

               Vanessa is flanked by two buff MALE MODELS à la Madonna.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great!  Great!  Smashing!
                              (beat)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No!  No!

               Love it.  Give me love.  Give me mouth.  Give me lips.

                                     (BEAT)
                         Going in very close now.

               He goes in closer.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me eyes.
                              (closer)
                         Give me cornea.
                              (closer)
                         Give me aqueous humour.
                              (closer)
                         Coming in closer.  Give me retina, 
                         Vanessa.
                              (closer)
                         Even closer.  Give me optic nerve.
                              (beat)
                         Love it!
                              (beat)
                         And...done.

               He throws the camera down.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm spent.  What say you we go out 
                         on the town?

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT

               Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double-
               decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner.  
               They're drinking champagne.

               Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding 
               his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point 
               to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it 
               to her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fancy a nibble?

                                     VANESSA
                         I couldn't have another bite.

               They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them.

               They begin to dance.

               Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT

               They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying 
               each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She 
               graciously accepts.

               64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE

               Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of 
               backgrounds&emdash; neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, 
               etc.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM

               Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking 
               out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled 
               leg straining upwards.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Watch out, you're on my hair!

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Sorry.  Move your hand to the left.  
                         There you go.  Gorgeous.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Go!  Just go!

               We hear a SPINNING SOUND.

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Left hand, blue.

               We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She 
               reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait a tick, I forgot something in 
                         the lobby.
                              (moving behind the 
                              couch)
                         I know what.  I'll take the stairs.

               Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe I'll take the escalator.

               Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why take the escalator when I could 
                         take a canoe?

               Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                         I haven't had fun like that since 
                         college.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry that bug up your ass had 
                         to die.

               She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound.

                                     VANESSA
                         Always wanting to have fun, that's 
                         you in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, this is me in a nutshell.

               Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind 
                         of nut has such a big nutshell?  How 
                         did I get into this bloody great big 
                         nutshell?

               Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're smashed, Vanessa.

                                     VANESSA
                         I am not.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes you are.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm 
                         always the designated driver.

               They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at 
               her.  There is an awkward silence.

               She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't.  You're drunk.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just 
                         beginning to see what my Mum was 
                         talking about.
                              (pause)
                         What was my mother like back in the 
                         Sixties?  I'm dying to know.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (sentimental)
                         She was very groovy.  She was so in 
                         love with your Dad.  If there was 
                         one

               other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and 
               treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But, 
               unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.

               Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep.  
               A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a

               RED LIGHT FLASHES.

               Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE 
               PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on the picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin, this is Basil 
                         Exposition from British Intelligence.  
                         Thank you for confirming the link 
                         between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find 
                         out what part Virtucon plays in 
                         something called Project Vulcan.  
                         I'll need you and Vanessa to get on 
                         that immediately.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Right away, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Where is Vanessa, by the way?

               Austin looks over at Vanessa's sleeping figure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         She's working on another lead right 
                         now.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Then you'll have to go it alone.  
                         Good luck.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Basil.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Oh, and Austin&emdash;

                                     AUSTIN
                              (knowing)
                         Yes?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Let me remind you that because of 
                         the unfreezing process you might 
                         experience flatulence at moments of 
                         extreme relaxation.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes.  Thank you.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         There's one more thing, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you.

               Austin looks at Alotta's Virtucon business card.

               INT.  ALOTTA'S JAPANESE STYLE PENTHOUSE

               Austin is in a dark penthouse suite.  Austin passes a piece 
               of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Paging Dr. Freud.

               He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase.  He 
               opens it.

               FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT

               Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature 
               camera/pendant.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (photographing)
                         Give it to me baby.  Super.

               We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's 
               holdings in a flow-chart fashion.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Pout for me, luv.  Smashing.  Yes!  
                         Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!

               One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under 
               that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", 
               and in CLOSE-UP&emdash; "Project Vulcan."

               We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a 
               cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core."

                                     AUSTIN
                         And I'm spent.

               The front door opens.  It's Alotta.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You seem surprised to see me.

                                     ALOTTA
                         I thought you'd quit while you were 
                         ahead.

                                     AUSTIN
                         What, and watch all my earnings go...
                              (smug)
                         Down the toilet?

                                     ALOTTA
                         What do you want, Mr...Cunningham, 
                         was it?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I 
                         call you Alotta...
                              (pause)
                         Please?

                                     ALOTTA
                         You may.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Your boss, Number Two, I understand 
                         that cat's involved in big underground 
                         drills.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Virtucon's main interest is in cable 
                         television, but they do have a 
                         subterranean construction division, 
                         yes.  How did you know?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (smug)
                         I didn't, baby, you just told me.

                         It's for the mining industry, Mr. 
                         Cunningham.  We can talk about 
                         business later.  But first, let me 
                         slip into something more comfortable.

                                     AUSTIN

               Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she 
               takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair 
               of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto.

               She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on 
               her shoulder, and enters the water.

                         Come in.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'd rather talk about Number Two.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?  
                         Come in, and I'll show you everything 
                         you need to know.

               Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He 
               goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over.

                                     ALOTTA
                         May I wash you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy.

               She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his 
               wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION.  
               It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."

               ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC.  
               SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS

               trousers.

                                     ALOTTA
                         In Japan, men come first and women 
                         come second.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or sometimes not at all.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Care for some saki?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sak-i it to me!

               Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her 
               ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation 
               Pills."  She drops two PILLS into his drink.

               Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly 
               woozy.

                                     ALOTTA
                         How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation.

               A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin.

                                     AUSTIN

                         'Pardon me for being rude, It was 
                         not me, it was my food.

               It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down 
               below.'

                                     ALOTTA
                         That's very clever.  Do you know any

                         we make love.  But first, tell me 
                         another poem.

                         I think it was Wordsworth who penned 
                         this little gem:  'Press the button, 
                         pull the chain, out comes a chocolate 
                         choo-choo train.'

                         Austin Powers is getting too close.  
                         He must be neutralized.  Any

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Ya wohl&emdash; I mean, yes wohl, 
                         Herr Doctor.  I have created the 
                         ultimate weapon to defeat Austin

                         Breathtaking, Frau.  These automated

               SEVEN SOLDIERS come in.  They are immediately attracted to 
               the FEMBOTS.  They throw down their guns and come to the

               When they get within range, guns POP out of the Fembots' 
               bras and begin FIRING, killing the guards.

                         Quite impressive.

                         By caliber, I mean both the barrel

                         that the Kreplachistani warhead has

               There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should 
               have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the 
               room, not knowing what to do with themselves.

                         a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan 
                         and is holding the world ransom for 
                         one-hundred billion dollars.  If the 
                         world doesn't pay up in four days, 
                         he's threatening to destroy the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Exposition.  Only two 
                         things, scare me, and one is nuclear 
                         war.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's the other?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Excuse me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's the other thing you're scared 
                         of?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Carnies.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Circus folk.
                              (shudders)
                         Nomads, you know.  They smell like 
                         cabbage.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (suffering him)
                         Indeed...If we could get back to the 
                         business at hand.  It's one thing to 
                         have a warhead, it's quite another 
                         thing to have the missiles to launch 
                         it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe these photographs are the last 
                         piece of that puzzle.
                              (hands him the photos)
                         I've uncovered the details on Project 
                         Vulcan.  It's a new subterranean 
                         warhead delivery system.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good God, and underground missile.  
                         We've long feared such a development.

                                     VANESSA
                         When did you find that out, Austin?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin did some reconnaissance work 
                         at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last 
                         night.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITON
                         Our next move is to infiltrate 
                         Virtucon.  Any ideas?

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their 
                         facilities every hour.  I suggest we 
                         pose as tourists and do site-level 
                         reconnaissance.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Top drawer, Kensington.  Oh, Austin, 
                         I want you to meet somebody.

               Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. 
                         Exposition.  She's in from Tunbridge 
                         Wells

               in Kent.  Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?

               Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         My God, Austin, what have you done?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not your mother, that's a 
                         man!

               Austin begins tugging on her hair.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                         Owww...my hair!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Get away from my mother!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, have you gone mad?

               The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                              (through pain)
                         Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSIION
                         Don't worry, mother.  Lie down.  
                         Austin, you have a lot of explaining 
                         to do.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was 
                         a man.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Damn it, man!  You're talking about 
                         my mother!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You must admit, she is rather mannish.  
                         No offense, but if that's a woman, 
                         it looks like she's been beaten with 
                         an ugly stick.

                                     VANESSA
                         Really, Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Look at her hands, baby!  Those are 
                         carpenter's hands.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         All right, Austin, I think you should 
                         go.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think if everyone were honest, 
                         they'd confess that the lady looks 
                         exactly like a man in drag.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm leaving!
                              (pause)
                         Oh, and Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, Basil?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks.

               Basil escorts his mother out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, may I have a word with you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Listen, I know I'm just being 
                         neurotic, but I can't shake this 
                         suspicious

               feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I 
               don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad 
               relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.  
               You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to 
               give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this 
               weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't be sorry.  You're right to be 
                         suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged 
                         her rotten.

                                     VANESSA
                              (stunned)
                         I can't believe you made love to her 
                         just like that.  Did you use 
                         protection?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, I had my nine-millimeter 
                         automatic.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, did you use a condom?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Only sailors use condoms, man.

                                     VANESSA
                         Not in the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well they should, filthy beggars, 
                         they go from port to port.  Alotta 
                         meant nothing to me.

                                     VANESSA
                              (pause)
                         Well, it means something to me.  If 
                         you want us to have a relationship, 
                         you've got to be a one-woman man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're 
                         everything to me.

                                     VANESSA
                         You just don't get it, do you, Austin?  
                         Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, 
                         you're going to be very lonely.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too 
               loose and water shoots all around the bathroom.

               EXT.  CAR - STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

               Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of 
               Las Vegas.

               INT.  CASINO BAR - NIGHT

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years 
               video on TV.  Vanessa enters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thirty years of political and social 
                         upheaval.  The fall of the Berlin 
                         wall, a female Prime Minister of 
                         England, the abolishment of Apartheid, 
                         a fascinating tapestry of human strum 
                         und drang.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was 
                         gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't 
                         see that one coming.

                                     VANESSA
                         Basil was very concerned to know 
                         where you were last night.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Out and about, doing odds and sods.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll tell him.  By the way, I've 
                         decided we should keep our 
                         relationship strictly professional.

               INT.  THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

               We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing 
               six or seven FATHERS with their teenage SONS.  It is 
               emotionally charged.  A lot of pained expressions and coffee 
               in Styrofoam cups.

                                     SON 1
                              (crying)
                         I love you, Dad.

                                     DAD 1
                         I love you, Son.

               They hug.  Everyone APPLAUDS.  We see Dr. Evil and Scott.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave.  
                         Thank you.  OK, group, we have two 
                         new member.  Say hello to Scott and 
                         his father, Mr....Ehville?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

                                     GROUP
                         Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (into it)
                         Hello, everybody.

                                     THERAPIST
                         So, Scott, why don't we start with 
                         you.  Why are you here?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, it's kind of weird.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't judge here.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         OK.  Well, I just really met my Dad 
                         for the first time three days ago.  
                         He was partially frozen for thirty 
                         years.  I never knew him growing up.  
                         He comes back and now he wants me to 
                         take over the family business.

                                     THERAPIST
                         And how do you feel about that?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't wanna take over the family 
                         business.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         But Scott, who's going to take over 
                         the world when I die?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Not me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         What do you want to do, Scott?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe 
                         I'd be a vet or something, cause I 
                         like animals and stuff.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil vet?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No.  Maybe, like, work in a petting 
                         zoo or something.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil petting zoo?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (shouting)
                         You always do that!
                              (calm)
                         Anyways, this is really hard, because, 
                         you know, my Dad is really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't label people here, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No, he's really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Scott.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, the boy's right.  I really am 
                         evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're 
                         here, that's what's important.  A 
                         journey of a thousand miles begins 
                         with one step.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I just think, like, he hates me.  I 
                         really think he wants to kill me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         OK, Scott, no one really wants to 
                         "kill" anyone here.  They say it, 
                         but they don't mean it.

               The group LAUGHS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, the boy's quite astute.  I 
                         am trying to kill him.  My Evil 
                         Associates have cautioned against 
                         it, so here he is, unfortunately, 
                         alive.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We've heard from Scott, now let's 
                         hear from you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         The details of my life are quite 
                         inconsequential.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That's not true, Doctor.  Please, 
                         tell us about your childhood.

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

               INT.  HALLWAY - VIRTUCON

               A TOUR is in progress.  Austin, Vanessa, and other TOURISTS 
               ride on an electric tram.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a 
                         rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you 
                         have a piece of gum?

                                     VANESSA
                              (in her own world)
                         Do you think she's prettier than I?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who?

                                     VANESSA
                         You know who.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No!  Don't lay your hang-ups on me, 
                         Vanessa.  You're being very trippy.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm looking at you, and the whole 
                         time I can't help thinking you had 
                         your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

                                     AUSTTIN
                         Well put.  Listen love, we can't 
                         keep having this fight.  I'm an 
                         International Man of Mystery.  
                         Sometimes in the course of my work 
                         to save the world I have to shag 
                         some crumpet.  It's all part of the 
                         job.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Welcome to Virtucon, the company of 
                         the future.
                              (pointing to large 
                              display window)
                         Virtucon is a leading manufacturer 
                         of many items you'll find right in 
                         your own home.  We make steel, 
                         volatile chemicals, petroleum-based 
                         products, and we also own the Franklin 
                         mint, which makes decorative hand-
                         painted theme plates for collectors.
                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

               The people on the tour APPLAUD.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Coming up on the left, we have the 
                         Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide 
                         range of Virtucon licensed products.  
                         On the right, you'll notice a door 
                         that leads to a restricted area.  
                         Only authorized personnel are allowed 
                         beyond that point.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA

               All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a 
               SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with 
               a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear 
               Virtucon coveralls.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll take him, you take her.

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin 
               and Vanessa follow.

               We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING 
               KNOCKED OUT.

               Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls 
               over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.   
               They go through the doors into the restricted area.

               INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

               They approach the security GUARD.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, we don't look anything like 
                         our photo badges.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a 
                         mind control technique during my 
                         travels to India.  I learned it from 
                         my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a 
                         chaste man who mysteriously died of 
                         a disease that had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis.

               Just watch me.  Watch me, now.

               They reach the guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Hi, folks.  You're entering a 
                         restricted zone.  Can I see your 
                         security badges?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               They flash their security badges to the guard.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, 
               RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE

               other, back and forth.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising.

                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     VANESSA
                         That's amazing.  Let's go!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on one second.

               Austin again does his mind control trick.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

                                     GUARD
                              (in trace)
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

               He hands Austin a piece of gum.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't mind if I do.

                                     GUARD
                              (slipping out of trance)
                         Hey!  Wait a minute, that's my last 
                         piece of gum.

               Austin does his mind-control again.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like)
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (mind-controlling)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

                                     VANESSA
                              (irritated)
                         Austin, we have to go!

               She pulls him away.

                                     GUARD (O.S.)
                              (faintly)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

               Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN - 
               TOP SECRET."  They walk through.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits 
               surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         This is the strongest, sharpest drill 
                         bit ever produced by man.  It weighs 
                         fifteen metric tones and can bore 
                         through a mile-thick bedrock of solid 
                         granite in seven seconds.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM

               A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count.  They 
               notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram.  The 
               guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               SFX:  ALARM GOES OFF

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (on PA)
                         Attention, there are intruders in 
                         the complex.

               All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin 
               and Vanessa.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         Get them!

               The scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold 
               with judo chops.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.  
               SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin 
               and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads 
               "VIRTUCON

               STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a 
               large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test 
               track very slowly.

               Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving 
               steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin 
               fanning out in a search.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Our only way out of here is to drive 
                         out!

               They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, 
               push him off, and assume the controls.

                                     P.A. (O.S.)
                         There they are!

               Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.  
               Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.  
               Austin punches the other one off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hang on!  I'm going to floor it!

               He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.

               TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They 
               are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a 
               fast-approaching car.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where did you learn to shoot?

                                     VANESSA
                         Where did you learn to drive?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY 
               AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME."  THE

               steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still 
               frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, watch out!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Where?  Where?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE 
               STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS

               away.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING 
               THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO

               downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along 
               with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks.

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE 
               STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF

               blood and guts.

               By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run 
               out into the hallway.

               INT.  HALLWAY

               The coast is clear.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thank God, Austin, we made it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, act naturally and we'll split 
                         this scene the way we came in, 
                         Vanessa.

               From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is 
               Random Task flanked by four SECURITY

               GUARDS.

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood 
               and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns 
               to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on 
               his jumpsuit.

               Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and 
               dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled 
               Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

               EXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES

               It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We 
               hear a PHONE RINGING.

               INT.  KITCHEN

               A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone.

                                     MIDDLE AGED LADY
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, that's right, he's a henchman 
                         in Dr. Evil's Private Army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  Killed?
                              (pause)
                         How?
                              (pause)
                         Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my 
                         God.  Thank you for calling.

               She HANGS UP.  A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.

                                     FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD
                         Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home?  
                         He said he was going to teach me to 
                         play ball.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Sit down, Billy, I have some bad 
                         news.  As you know, your brother 
                         Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's 
                         Private Army.

                                     BILLY
                         Was?  What is it, Mom?

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Your brother was run over by a 
                         steamroller.

                                     BILLY
                         A steamroller?
                              (bursting into tears)
                         No, not Steve!  Since Dad died, 
                         Steve's been like a father to me.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         I'm sorry son.  People never think 
                         how things affect the family of the 
                         henchman.
                              (hugging him)
                         I love you, Billy.
                              (to herself, out loud)
                         I wonder if we'll be able to receive 
                         Steve's henchman's comp.

               We see a Virtucon electric minivan humning along.

               INT.  BACK OF ELECTRIC MINIVAN

               Austin and Vanessa are unconscious.

               EXT.  HIGHWAY

               The electric minivan turns onto a dirt road that leads to a 
               boulder.

               EXT.  DESERT - BOULDER

               The boulder lifts up and the minivan drives into it.

                         Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.

               The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table.  
               All the evil associates are present.  Dr. Evil squeezes a 
               tennis ball repeatedly.  Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch 
               of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.

                         Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. 
                         Powers.  Mrs. Kensington's daughter, 
                         how lovely.  I believe your name is 
                         Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except 
                         for obvious reasons.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't understand.

                         What's wrong with your hand?

                         Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a 
                         little late for that.  I'm a freak!

               Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

               He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually 
               normal, just slightly aged.

               He presses a button on his chair panel.  A giant canvas falls, 
               unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean 
               bore&emdash; the VULCAN.  It is rather phallic.

                         Does that make you horny?

                                     VANESSA
                              (under her breath)

                         So powerful it can penetrate the 
                         Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton 
                         nuclear warhead into the planet's 
                         hot liquid core.  Upon detonation, 
                         every volcano on the planet will 
                         erupt.

                         Why should we pay him the money?  
                         He's only got one warhead and he's 
                         going to detonate it deep underground.

                         My God, man, don't you understand?  
                         It won't just be active volcanoes, 
                         inactive ones will erupt as well.

                         hours.  You have your instructions.

               Good-bye.

               The screen goes BLACK.

                         Mr. Powers?

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

               Austin and Vanessa are seated at a table with Frau.  WAITERS 
               serve food.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I think you'll enjoy the food.  I 
                         have the best chef in the world.  
                         His name is Ezekial.  He's made of 
                         seventy-five percent plastic.

               Scott enters.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott my boy, come here.  How was 
                         your day?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, me and a buddy went to the 
                         video arcade in town and, like, they 
                         don't speak English right, and so my 
                         buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 
                         'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't 
                         speak French or whatever', and the 
                         other guy goes something in Paris 
                         talk, and I go 'um, just back off' 
                         and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make 
                         me'.

                         Fascinating.  What are your plans 
                         for this evening?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good 
                         tittie movie on Skinemax.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         And that's how you want to live your 
                         life, is it?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Yeah.  What?

               ANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT.  
               DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE

               button labeled "SCOTT."  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away.

                         Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's

                         Why are you feeding him?  Why don't 
                         you just kill him?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         In due time.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         But what if he escapes?  Why don't 
                         you just shoot him?  What are you 
                         waiting for?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have a better idea.  I'm going to 
                         put him in an easily-escapable 
                         situation involving an overly-
                         elaborate and exotic death.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Why don't you just shoot him now?  
                         Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just 
                         shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         One more peep out of you and you're 
                         grounded.  Let's begin.

               A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil 
               hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of 
                         mine are joining us for dinner.

               They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.

               The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts 
               them in the dipping mechanism.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil, do you really expect them 
                         to pay?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to 
                         die.  Even after they pay me the 
                         money, I'm still going to melt all 
                         the cities of the world with hot 
                         magma.
                              (to guard)
                         All right, guard, begin the 
                         unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping 
                         Mechanism.

               The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly 
               towards the surface of the water.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Release the sharks!
                              (to the room)
                         All the sharks have had laser beams 
                         attached to their heads.  I figure 
                         every creature deserves a warm meal.

                              nervously)
                         Dr. Evil?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting 
                         my moment of triumph.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         It's about the sharks.  Since you 
                         were frozen, they've been placed on 
                         the Endangered Species List.  We 
                         tried to get some, but it will take 
                         months to clear up the red tape.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (disappointed)
                         Right.
                              (to Austin)
                         Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you 
                         in a tank of piranhas with laser 
                         beams attached to their heads.

               Frau clears her throat again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What is it now?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, we experimented with lasers, 
                         but you would be surprised at how 
                         heavy they are.  They actually 
                         outweighed the piranha themselves, 
                         and the fish, well, they sank to the 
                         bottom and died.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have one simple request&emdash; 
                         sharks with friggin' laser beams 
                         attached to their heads, and it can't 
                         be done?  Remind me again why I pay 
                         you people?

               What do we have?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         They're mutated sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?  Are they ill-tempered?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Please allow me to demonstrate.

               Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope 
               towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch 
               through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls 
               the rope back.  The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill-
                         tempered sea bass it is.
                              (to the room)
                         Come, let's return to dinner.  Close 
                         the tank.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Aren't you going to watch them?  
                         They'll get away!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, we'll leave them alone and not 
                         actually witness them dying, and 
                         we'll just assume it all went to 
                         plan.

                         five seconds, I'll come back and

                         No Scott.  You just don't get it, do 
                         you?

               Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the 
               tank.

               INT.  TANK AREA

               Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They 
               can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.

                                     VANESSA
                         What's your plan?

               Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing 
               Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         First, I plan to soil myself.  Then, 
                         I plan to regroup and think about 
                         the next move.  Any thoughts?

                                     VANESSA
                         Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep 
                         this on me just in case.

               She pulls out a container of dental floss.

                                     AUSTIN
                         All right, I get it.  I have bad 
                         teeth.  You have to understand, in 
                         Britain in the Sixties you could be 
                         a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  
                         It didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to 
                         get to the ledge.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing idea!  Give it to me.

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!

               Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of 
               toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

                                     GUARD
                              (screaming, rubbing 
                              his eyes)
                         My eyes!  My eyes!

               Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing 
               both ends.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on, Vanessa!

               She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

               BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's 
               head.

                                     VANESSA
                              (shouting)
                         Austin, watch out!

               Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's 
               head off like a blender.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Not a good time to lose one's head.

                                     VANESSA
                         Indeed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not the way to get ahead in 
                         life.

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's a shame he wasn't more 
                         headstrong.

                                     VANESSA
                         Shut up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fair enough.

               They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The 
               name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

               It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad 
               BUSTY WAITRESSES.

               INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT

               At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, 
               scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer.

                                     GUY 1
                         I can't believe John Smith is getting 
                         married tomorrow.

                                     GUY 2
                         Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not 
                         like him to be late for anything, 
                         especially his own stag party.

                                     GUY 3
                         Well, you know he's a henchman for 
                         Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late.  
                         Can I just say something that may 
                         sound a little sappy?  I think it's 
                         a testament to our friend John that 
                         so many of his buddies showed up in 
                         his honor.  There's a lot of love in 
                         this room.

               A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Hi, I have a phone call here for the 
                         John Smith party.

                                     GUY 1
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
                              (pause)
                         That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's 
                         private army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  He's dead?
                              (pause)
                         Decapitated by mutated flying sea 
                         bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you.

               He hangs up.

                                     GUY 2
                              (to Guy 1)
                         Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that 
                         John?  Is he coming late?

                                     GUY 1
                         Guys, John's not coming.

                                     GUY 2
                         Why?

                                     GUY 1
                         He was decapitated by mutated flying 
                         sea bass.

                                     GUYS
                              (upset)
                         Oh no, oh my God, etc.

                         All right, to Smittie!

               Everyone raises their glasses.

                                     GUYS

               The cart approaches the subterranean probe and the warhead 
               is loaded up into its tail.

               Two Fembots guard the door and five are on the bed in come-
               hither poses.

                                     FEMBOT
                         You can't resist us, Mr. Powers.  
                         Eventually you'll give in.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Au contraire, I think you can't resist 
                         me.

               MUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive 
               dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches 
               out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his 
               mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.

               He throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands 
               perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the 
               remaining cigarette.

               Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are 
               aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, 
               and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

               She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and 
               forth like in Jacob's Ladder.

               Eventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down 
               to his Union Jack bikini briefs and

               turns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.

               He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.  
               Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his 
               bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.

               He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.  
               He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, 
               whose head explodes.

               Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.  
               Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining 
               Fembots.

                         Oh, I fell over.

               Their heads explode simultaneously.  All the Fembots are 
               lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then, Vanessa enters, 
               flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and 
               looks at Austin in his briefs.  She's hurt.  The commandos 
               salute Austin.

               Austin and Vanessa lead FIFTEEN COMMANDOS into the chamber 
               and GUNFIRE breaks out.  Two CATWALKS run the length of the 
               chamber, meeting at the door to the control area.

               The commandos split into two groups and lob grenades at the 
               PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS who are guarding the stairs leading to 
               the catwalks.  They go flying.

               The giant probe engine begins to throb and whirl.  The tip

               They continue to run towards the guards behind some STACKED 
               BARRELS.  Two OBVIOUS STUNT DOUBLES run out from behind the 
               barrels in a continuous motion instead of Austin and Vanessa 
               and diver over the rail.

               ANGLE ON THE OTHER TEAM OF COMMANDOS

               They are making progress on the other catwalk.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA

               They have landed safely, but are surrounded by FIVE PRIVATE

               one has a bazooka, one has a flamethrower, one has a Gatling 
               gun, etc.  They see Austin and throw down their weapons, 
               pulling out KNIVES.

               One of the private soldiers runs at Austin and he stabs him.  
               Another soldier runs at Austin, and Austin also stabs him.  
               A third private army soldier runs at Austin.  Austin does 
               the stabbing motion.

               Austin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires 
               at him.  Austin returns fires, shooting up some electrical 
               equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr.

               Bigglesworth running out a read door.

                         quite a head on your shoulders, I 
                         dare to coin.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Yes, I am programmed to answer any 
                         question.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?  Let me ask you this.  What 
                         is love?

                         That does not compute.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why not?  It's a question.

                         Love is...love is...love is...

               The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring.

               There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin

                         Where's the abort button?

               The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 
               'give me one second.'

                         It's right over there.

               Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just 
               then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot 
               him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off 
               his SHOE.

               Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

               Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

               The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe 
               has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to 
                         have a lump there, you idiot!  Who 
                         throws a shoe?  You fight like a 
                         woman.

               Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands 
               there, menacing, missing one shoe.

               Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin 
               is a Big Gulp.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for a drink?

               Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in 
               front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels 
               through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING

                         I've got you, Dr. Evil!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so 
                         different, you and I.  It's true, 
                         you're British, and I'm Belgian.  
                         You have a full head of hair, mine 
                         is slightly receding.  You're thin, 
                         I'm about forty pounds overweight.  
                         OK, we are different, I'm not making 
                         a very good point.  However, isn't 
                         it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very 
                         things you stand for&emdash; swinging, 
                         free love, parties, distrust of 
                         authority- are all now, in the 
                         Nineties, considered to

               be...evil?  Maybe we have more in common than you care to 
               admit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, man, what we swingers were 
                         rebelling against were uptight squares 
                         like you, whose bag was money and 
                         world domination.  We were innocent, 
                         man.  If we'd known the consequences 
                         of our sexual liberation, we would 
                         have done things differently, but 
                         the spirit would have remained the 
                         same.  It's freedom, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Your freedom has cause more pain and 
                         suffering in the world than any plan 
                         I ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom 
                         failed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's why right now is a very groovy 
                         time, man.  We still have freedom, 
                         but we also have responsibility.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really, there's nothing more pathetic 
                         than an aging hipster.

               Alotta enters.  She holds a gun to Vanessa's head.

                         Not so fast.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, it seems the tables have turned, 
                         Mr. Powers.

               Just then, Scott Evil enters.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

               Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It seems the tables have turned again, 
                         Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Not really.  Kill the little bastard.  
                         See what I care.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Man, you are one chilly square!

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Dad, we just made a breakthrough in 
                         group!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I had the group liquidated, you little 
                         shit.  They were insolent.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I 
                         was never artificially created in a 
                         lab.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, don't say that...

               Scott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun 
               out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls out a knife.  Austin 
               SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by 
               the throat.

                                     VANESSA
                         This is for sleeping with my man, 
                         you whore!

                                     ALOTTA
                         I didn't sleep with him.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't believe you.

                                     ALOTTA
                              (choking)
                         It's the teeth.

                                     VANESSA
                         OK, I believe you.  But you still 
                         must be chopped.

               Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

                                     VANESSA
                         Judo chop!

               Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which 
               closes and begins to lift up through

               A HOLE IN THE CEILING.  HE RUNS IN.  ON THE WAY, HE FLIPS A

               Austin SHOOTS and misses.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the 
               hole in the ceiling.

               Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a

                         So, Dr. Evil, do you expect the world 
                         to pay the ransom?

                         die.

               GIRL IN BATHING SUIT

               Oh, Austin, kiss me.

               He turns around.  It's Austin Powers, played by ROGER MOORE, 
               with the same glasses and bad teeth.

               He does a frightening grin, displaying the AWFUL TEETH.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT

               GRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA

               It is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY

               The lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized 
               conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, 
               including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket 
               and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID.

               ANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED 
               HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY

               CAT.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face always unseen)
                         Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good.  
                         As you know, my plot to high-jack 
                         nuclear weapons and hold the world 
                         hostage has failed.  Again.  This 
                         organization will not tolerate 
                         failure.

               He presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic 
               doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip

               back and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and 
               smoking.

                         I spared your lives because I need 
                         you to help me rid the world of the 
                         only man who can stop me now.  We 
                         must go to London.  I've set a trap 
                         for Austin Powers!

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               MUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES.

               We start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet 
               pants walking down the street in rhythm, à la Saturday Night 
               Fever.

               We pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of 
               Mystery.  He's a swinger, with

               medium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National 
               Health Services glasses.

               Austin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is 
               that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies.

               Austin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to 
               a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus.

               Austin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO 
               BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all 
               start to twist to the music, including the Bobby.

               (PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR 
               FREEZE FRAMES À LA SWEET CHARITY.)

               In the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently 
               to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area.

               One wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a 
               metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears 
               a see-through Mary Quant dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (taking photos)
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me baby.  Smashing!

               We see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in 
               the stewardess outfit foes on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder.  
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No.  No.

               Show me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm 
               spent.

               Austin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT 
               scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get these off to Fab Magazine right 
                         away.

                                     SUPERMODEL 1
                         Austin, you've really outdone yourself 
                         this time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks, baby.

                                     SUPERMODEL 2
                              (suggestively)
                         We could have another photo session 
                         back at my flat.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (coyly)
                         Oh, behave!

                                     SUPERMODEL 3
                         Austin, I love you!

                                     AUSTIN
                         So many women, so little time.

               A gaggle of MOD GIRLS come towards the shoot site.  They 
               recognize Austin and SCREAM hysterically.

                                     MOD GIRL 1
                         It's Austin Powers!

               Austin runs away.  The mob chases after him a la Hard Day's 
               Night.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Two BAD GUYS attack Austin.  He JUDO CHOPS them.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               The mob of girls catches up to Austin and he runs away.

               EXT.  PHONE BOOTH

               Austin's in a phone booth with his back turned.  The mob 
               runs by.  He steps out, disguised only by a beard.

               EXT.  GUARD STATION - LONDON - DAY

               Austin is jiving down the street and comes across a stoned-
               face red-coated BUCKINGHAM PALAM GUARD standing at attention 
               just outside his guard box.

               Austin mugs for the guard, trying to get him to crack up, 
               but to no avail.  Finally, he pulls a big sixties FLOWER 
               from behind the guard's head and presents it to him.  They 
               both crack up.

               EXT.  PHOTO BOOTH

               The girls run by a Sixties-era photo booth with somebody 
               inside.  Austin steps out.

               ANGLE ON THE FILM STRIP

               Panels 1-3 show Austin with various exotic MODELS.  The fourth 
               panel shows Austin with the QUEEN.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET

               Austin spots a VERY PREGNANT HIPPY GIRL with a placard that 
               says "PROTEST!" in a funky font.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You might want to protest a bit louder 
                         next time, luv.

               The both laugh.

               2L  FULL SCREEN INSERT - AUSTIN'S PASSPORT

               The passport opens.  We see Austin's dour photo.  Then he 
               gives an insane grin, showing his bad teeth.  The page flips 
               and we see visa stamps from all the exotic places he's been.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin flips a coin into a BLIND MAN's cup.  The blind man, 
               obviously sighted, moves the cup to catch the coin.  Austin 
               wags his finger in a "oh, you" fashion, and then proceeds to 
               knee him the balls.

               EXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin is being chased around the corner by a GAGGLE OF 
               SCHOOLGIRLS.

               After a moment, Austin returns from around the corner with a 
               baton, followed by a MARCHING BAND.

               The schoolgirls pick up his trail again and he begins to 
               run.

               A 1967 Jaguar XKE convertible, which is decorated with a 
               large Union Jack, pulls beside Austin.

               He jumps over the door into the moving convertible, racing 
               off just ahead of the crowd.

               EXT./INT.  JAGUAR - STREETS OF LONDON - DAY

               The driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, 
               a beautiful woman in her thirties.

               They drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, Mrs. Kensington.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING 
                         RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a 
                         distinctive PHONE RING.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief 
                         of British Intelligence.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone.  
               ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a 
               distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  "Basil 
               Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence."

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin.  This is Basil 
                         Exposition, Chief of British 
                         Intelligence.

               You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're 
               with Agent

               Mrs. Kensington.  The year is 1967, and you're talking on a 
               picture phone.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We know all that, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I just wanted to be extremely clear 
                         so that everyone knows what's going 
                         on at any given time.  We've just 
                         received word that Dr. Evil, the 
                         ultimate square, is planning to take 
                         over the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in 
                         jail for good.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week, 
                         Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel 
                         Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's 
                         planning a trap for you tonight at 
                         the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat 
                         Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus 
                         here in swinging London.

               A panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing 
               Austin's position and the location of the club.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Just where you'd never think to look 
                         for him.  We'll be there.

                         Good luck, Austin.

               The Jaguar pulls up in front of the swinging nightclub.  
               Mrs. Kensington steps out of the car, dressed in a tight 
               leather fightsuit.  She looks fabulous.

               It's a swinging club.  FREAKS abound.  In one corner, there 
               is a PRESS CONFERENCE in progress.

                         Well, you can't always get what you 
                         want.

               In one corner ANDY WARHOL sits in front of his multi-colored 
               Elvis (or equivalent).  He body paints a butterfly on the 
               thigh of a MOD GIRL wearing a metallic miniskirt outfit.

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         Austin Powers?  Hi, I'm Andy Warhol.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hey, how are you?

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         Hungry.

                         Here, have this can of Campbell's 
                         Tomato Soup.

               Austin hands Andy a can of soup.

                                     ANDY WARHOL
                         I'm going to paint this can of soup 
                         and become famous and not give you 
                         any credit for it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         If you can become famous, everyone 
                         will have their fifteen minutes of 
                         fame, man.

                         "Fifteen minutes of fame?"  I'm going 
                         to use that quote and not give you

               INT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB

               HER MAJESTY, THE QUEEN is giving Austin a Victoria's Cross 
               like the Lyndon Johnson scene in Forrest Gump.  Behind them, 
               are two COLDSTREAM GUARDS and the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.

                                     QUEEN
                         Austin Powers, Britain owes you a 
                         debt of gratitude.

               Austin gives a cheeky look to Mrs. Kensington.

                                     QUEEN
                         I understand you were wounded.  Where 
                         were you hit?

                                     AUSTIN
                         In the but-tocks.

                                     QUEEN
                         That must be a sight.  I'd kind of 
                         like to see that.

               Austin turns around, drops his pants, and shows his wounded 
               bum (matching Gump's) to the queen.

               The queen walks away.

                                     QUEEN
                              (laughing)
                         Nice buttocks.

               In the line-up we also see FOREST GUMP.  He has to pee very 
               badly.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         We've got to find Dr. Evil!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I've got an idea.

               He PUNCHES a PRETTY MOD GIRL in the face, knocking her out 
               cold.

                                     EVERYONE
                         Ohhh!

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin, why in God's name did you 
                         strike that woman?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That ain't no woman!  It's a man, 
                         man.  It's one of Dr. Evil's 
                         assassins.

               Austin pulls off the mod girl's wig.  She is a MALE ASSASSIN.  
               The assassin comes to and leaps to his feet.

               Mrs. Kensington knocks his feet from under him.  The assassin 
               hits the ground and pulls out a dagger.  Mrs. Kensington 
               kicks the knife out of his hand and Austin gets him in a 
               head-lock from behind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where's Doctor Evil?

               ANGLE ON:  A FINGER WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE 
               FINGER PULLS THE TRIGGER OF A SPEAR

               gun.  The assassin falls forward.  A spear protrudes from 
               his back.  Austin sees Dr. Evil as he runs through a door.  
               They give chase.

               INT.  CLUB - BACK ROOM

               They enter.  Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you again, Dr. Evil!

               The chair fills with a WHITE MIST.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unseen, through mist)
                         Not this time.  Come, Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!
                              (calling out)
                         See you in the future, Mr. Powers!

               Before the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair.  
               A sign on the egg reads "CRYOGENIC

               FREEZING BEGINNING."

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         My God!  He's freezing himself.

               Austin begins FIRING at the egg chair.  The ceiling opens up 
               and the egg rises through the opening.  Everything begins to 
               RUMBLE.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling.

                         I'll be back, Mr. Powers, when free 
                         love is dead, and greed and avarice

               Basil Exposition (now aged 30 years), Command Gilmour, and 
               NICOLAI BORSCHEVSKY, a Russian General, put on extreme-weather 
               gear over their uniforms.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         As you know, gentlemen, Dr. Evil had 
                         himself frozen in 1967.  Soon after, 
                         Austin Powers volunteered to have 
                         himself frozen, in the event Dr. 
                         Evil should ever return.  We believe 
                         Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot 
                         to take over the world.  And that, 
                         gentlemen, is why we're here.

               They pass a row of cryogenic holding berths, each containing 
               a naked PERSON in suspended animation, a la Demolition Man.  
               They pass GARY COLEMAN, EVEL KNIEVAL (with cape), and VANILLA 
               ICE, all in suspended animation.  They pass a now-empty berth 
               with a plate that reads "JOHN

               TRAVOLTA."

                         Who is this Austin Powers?  Is he a 
                         British operative?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         No, he worked freelance, an 
                         internationally renowned swinging 
                         photographer by day and the ultimate 
                         gentlemen spy by night.

               Finally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His 
               hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face 
               suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His 
               glasses are frosted over.  He is very hairy.

               Lasers begin to cut Austin out of the ice in one huge cube.

               into a high-tech melting vat of warm liquid GOO.

               Austin comes to life out of the goo on a draining platform.

               INT.  EXAMINATION AREA

               Technicians lead a half-asleep Austin to a screened area, 
               where only his feet and head are visible.  He's washed off 
               with a series of hot-water jets.

                                     FEMALE ANNOUNCER
                              (on PA)
                         Cleansing complete.  Stage Five, 
                         evacuation beginning.

               He's given futuristic inoculations and then led to a screened-
               in toilet area.  We can hear the sound of PEE ENTERING THE 
               BOWL.

               He PEES for a while, then a little longer.

               And then EVEN LONGER STILL.

               The stream seems to be subsiding...then begins STRONGER than 
               ever.

               He is still PEEING.

               Finally, it STOPS.

               He begins PEEING again.

               A little LONGER.

               Then in short staccato BURSTS.

               The it STOPS.  Pause.

               Two DRIPS.

                         Austin Powers is now completed.

               Austin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle à la Dr.

               and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors.

                         The shouting is a temporary side-
                         effect of the unfreezing process.

                         My God, Vanessa's got a smashing

                         How do I tell them that because of 
                         the unfreezing process, I have no 
                         inner monologue?

               There is an uncomfortable SILENCE.

                         with mind-expanding

               drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a

                         My mother's told me all about you.

                         If it's a lie, goddamn her.  It it's 
                         the truth, goddamn me.

                         Italian shoes.  One pair of tie-dyed 
                         socks, purple.  One vinyl recording

                         This sort of thing ain't my bag, 
                         baby.

                         Listen, Mr. Powers, I look forward 
                         to working with you, but do me a 
                         favor and stop calling me baby.  You 
                         can address me as Agent Kensington.  
                         We have to leave immediately.  We've 
                         preserved your private jet just as 
                         you left it.  It's waiting at Heathrow 
                         Airport.

               the tailpiece.

               INT.  PRIVATE PSYCHEDELIC JET

               The inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet&emdash; rust shag 
               carpet, brown walls, and beads.  Austin and Vanessa sit on 
               beanbag chairs.  Vanessa works on her lap top.

                         Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How 
                         does a hot chick like you end up 
                         working at the Ministry of Defense?

                                     VANESSA
                         I went to Oxford and excelled in 
                         several subjects, but I ended up 
                         specializing in foreign languages.  
                         I wanted to travel -- see the world.  
                         In my last year I was accepted into 
                         the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies 
                         sector.  I thought I was off on an 
                         exciting career, but my job was to 
                         read everything printed in every 
                         country.  It's very boring.  My whole 
                         day is spent reading wedding 
                         announcements in Farsi.  If I do 
                         well with this case, I finally get 
                         promoted to field operative...

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, 
                         why don't we go into the back and 
                         shag?

                                     VANESSA
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         man, I want to see if my bits and 
                         pieces are still working.

                                     VANESSA
                         Excuse me?

                         I'm sorry?

                         Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you 
                         must be a little confused, but we 
                         have a very serious situation at 
                         hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd 
                         concentrate on our mission and give 
                         your libido a rest.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Have you ever made love to a Chigro?

                         A Chigro?

                         Chinese, part Negro&emdash; Chigro.

                              (offended)
                         We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.  
                         It's considered offensive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's right.  You're supposed to 
                         say 'colored' now, right?
                              (spotting the flight

                         the sexy stews!

               The STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily.  
               One of them is a man and another wears braces.

                                     FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                         Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'?  
                         We're called 'flight attendants' 
                         now, thank you very much.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a 
                         whore, I'm a sex worker', baby.

                         are a few things we need to discuss.  
                         First of all, we're not wearing these.

                         Seems pretty straightforward, don't 
                         you think...listen darling, I think 
                         you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get 
                         your telephone number?

                         Sure, it's easy to remember.
                              (writing on his hand)
                         It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare 
                         the craft for take-off now.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing!  When we land I'll give 
                         you a tinkle on the telling bone.

               The flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's 
                         two things I know about life: one, 
                         Americans will never take to soccer.  
                         Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses 
                         love to shag!

               They're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, 
               and be honest.

                                     VANESSA
                         Sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?

                                     VANESSA
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny?  Randy, you 
                         know.  To you, am I eros manifest?

                                     VANESSA
                         I hope this is part of the unfreezing 
                         process.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Listen, Vanessa, I'm a swinger&emdash; 
                         that's what I do, I swing.

                                     VANESSA
                         I understand that, Mr. Powers, but 
                         let me be perfectly clear with you, 
                         perhaps to the point of being 
                         insulting.  I will never have sex 
                         with you, ever.  If you were the 
                         last man on Earth and I was the last 
                         woman on Earth, and the future of 
                         the human race depended on our having 
                         sex simply for procreation, I still 
                         would not have sex with you.

               Austin is oblivious.

               There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think 
               may be linked to Dr. Evil.  Many of the Virtucon executives 
               gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying.  That's 
               the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat

               Las Vegas" sign.  Luxor.  The giant cowboy whose arm waves.  
               Caesar's Palace.  The montage ends on the modern skyline of

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face again unseen)
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a 
                         long time, but I'm back.  It's all 
                         gone perfectly to plan except for 
                         one small flaw.  Because of a 
                         technical error, my right arm was 
                         not frozen.  I was therefore by 
                         definition only partially frozen.

               ANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty, 
               eyes darting left and right.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But my design was perfect!  Your 
                         autonomic functions were shut down, 
                         and even though your arm wasn't 
                         frozen, the aging was retarded, 
                         therefore your right arm is only 
                         slightly older than the left.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Can't you see I'm only half a man?  
                         Look at me, I'm a freak!

               He holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         But Dr. Evil, all you need to do 
                         is&emdash;
                              (holding up tennis 
                              ball)
                         --work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze 
                         it for twenty minutes a day.  A few 
                         months of that and it'll be just as 
                         strong as the other arm...

                                     DR. EVIL
                         And look what you've done to Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth!

               ANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH

               who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair 
               around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself.

                                     MUSTAFA
                         We could not anticipate feline 
                         complications due to the reanimation 
                         process&emdash;

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face unseen)
                         Silence!

               ANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT

               Dr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he 
               falls backwards into a pit.

                                     MUSTAFA
                              (blood-curdling scream)
                         Ahhhhhhhhh!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (face unseen)
                         Let this be a reminder to you all 
                         that this organization will not 
                         tolerate failure.

               MUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY

               ANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY 
               FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS

               scar on his cheek.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, let's get down to business.

               More muffled SCREAMS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We've got a lot of work to do.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         Someone help me!  I'm still alive, 
                         only I'm very badly burned.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (slightly distracted)
                         Some of you I know, some of you I'm 
                         meeting for the first time.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone 
                         call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a 
                         lot of pain.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (very frustrated)
                         You've all been gathered here to 
                         form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me.

               He picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         If somebody can open the retrieval 
                         hatch down here, I could get out.  
                         See, I designed this device myself 
                         and...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you 
                         found me.  Listen, I'm very badly 
                         burned, so if you could just&emdash;

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         Ow!  You shot me!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.  Okay.  Moving on.

                                     MUSTAFA (O.S.)
                              (muffled)
                         You shot me right in the arm!  Why 
                         did&emdash; SFX:  Muffled Gunshot.  
                         Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Let me go around the table and 
                         introduce everyone.  Frau

                         ...founder of the militant wing of

               He stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it.  
               It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room.

                                     DR. EVIL

                         tiny keepsake on every victim he 
                         kills.  Scotland Yard would love to

                         charms!

               Everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face.

                         It's a television commercial with

                         Finally, I come to my number two 
                         man.  His name:  Number Two.

                         For thirty years, Number Two has run 
                         Virtucon, the legitimate face of my 
                         evil empire.

               He hits a button.  The conference table slowly rotates to

                         Over the last thirty years, Virtucon 
                         has grown by leaps and bounds.  About 
                         fifteen years ago, we changed from 
                         volatile chemicals to the 
                         communication industry.  We own cable

                         Some plates, like the Gone With The

                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment,

                         Gentlemen, I have a plan.  It's called 
                         blackmail.  The Royal Family of 
                         Britain are the wealthiest landowners 
                         in the world.  Either the Royal Family 
                         pays us an exorbitant amount of money, 
                         or we make it look like Prince 
                         Charles, the heir to the throne, has 
                         had an affair outside of marriage 
                         and, therefore, they would have to 
                         divorce.

               There is an uncomfortable silence.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Um, Dr. Evil, Prince Charles did 
                         have an affair.  He admitted it, and 
                         they are now divorced, actually.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         People have to tell me these things.  
                         I've been frozen for thirty years, 
                         throw me a bone here.
                              (pausing)
                         OK, no problem.  Here's my second 
                         plan.  Back in the Sixties I had a 
                         weather changing machine that was in 
                         essence a sophisticated heat beam 
                         which we called a "laser."  Using 
                         this laser, we punch a hole in the 
                         protective layer around

               the Earth, which we scientists call the "Ozone Layer."  Slowly 
               but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the 
               risk of skin cancer.  That is, unless the world pays us a 
               hefty ransom.

               There is another uncomfortable silence.

                         Umm, that also has already happened.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.
                              (pause)
                         Oh, hell, let's just do what we always 
                         do.  Let's hijack some nuclear weapons 
                         and hold the world hostage.
                              (pause)
                         Gentlemen, it's come to my attention 
                         that a breakaway Russian Republic 
                         called Kreplachistan will be 
                         transferring a nuclear warhead to 
                         the United Nations in a few days.  
                         Here's the plan.  We get the warhead, 
                         and we hold the world ransom...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FOR ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is an uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't you think we should ask for 
                         more than a million dollars?  A 
                         million dollars isn't that much money 
                         these days.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         All right then...
                              (dramatic pause)
                         ...FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!

               There is another uncomfortable pause.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Virtucon alone makes over nine billion 
                         dollars a year.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pleasantly surprised)
                         Oh, really?
                              (slightly irritated)
                         One-hundred billion dollars.
                              (pause)
                         OK, make it happen.  Anything else?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Remember when we froze your semen, 
                         you said that if it looked like you 
                         weren't coming back to try and make 
                         you a son so that a part of you would 
                         live forever?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, after a few years, we got sort 
                         of impatient.  Dr. Evil, I want you 
                         to meet your son.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         My son?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Yes.
                              (calling out)
                         Scott!

               SCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a 
               Kurt Cobain T-shirt.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hi.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr. 
                         Evil.
                              (emotional)
                         I have a son!  I have a son!  
                         Everyone, I have a son!
                              (gesturing to globe)
                         Someday, Scott, this will all be 
                         yours.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I haven't seen you my whole life and 
                         now you show up and want a 
                         relationship?  I hate you!

               EXT.  JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY

               Vanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing!

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a 
                         secure cellular phone, an on-board 
                         computer, and a Global Geosynchronous 
                         Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, 
                         this.

               The glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various 
               dental hygiene products&emdash; floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, 
               dental mirror, and cleaning tool.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me guess.  The floss is garotte 
                         wire, the toothpaste contains plastic 
                         explosives, and the toothbrush is 
                         the detonation device.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, actually.  I don't know how to 
                         put this really.  Well, there have 
                         been fabulous advances in the field 
                         of dentistry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why?  What's wrong with my teeth?

               EXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT

               The Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door.

               INT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM

               Vanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin 
               takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite 
               suitcases.

                                     AUSITN
                         Which side of the bed do you want?

                                     VANESSA
                         You're going to sleep on the sofa.  
                         I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, 
                         that the only reason we're sharing a 
                         room is to support our cover story 
                         that we're a married couple on 
                         vacation.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, shall we shag now, or shall we 
                         shag later?  How do you like to do 
                         it?  Do you like to wash up first?  
                         Top and tails?  A whore's bath?  
                         Personally, before I'm on the job, I 
                         like to give my undercarriage a bit 
                         of a how's-your-father.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (off her angry reaction)
                         I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to 
                         get a rise out of you.

               They both laugh.

                                     VANESSA
                         Let's unpack.

               HER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents.  
               All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, nerd alert.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington 
               shaver with huge English plug.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel 
               iron and a Braun blow drier.

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle 
               of Jurgens lotion.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a 
               plastic baggie marked "Underthings" and her shoes in a baggie 
               marked "Shoes."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and 
               Hai Karate cologne.

               HER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled "Dr. Evil - 
               Top Secret."

               HIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump.  
               Vanessa sees it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's 
                         playing a prank on me!  Honestly, 
                         this isn't mine.

                                     VANESSA
                              (suffering)
                         I'm sure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think I'll give that stew a ding-a-
                         ling.

               Austin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm.  
               After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the 
               handset.

                                     MOVIE PHONE VOICE
                              (through handset)
                         Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM!

               Austin covers the mouthpiece and whispers to Vanessa.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got her answering machine.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa walk through the casino.  Austin gives 
               PEOPLE two-handed handshakes.  They stare like he's a freak.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love Las Vegas, man.  Oh, I forgot 
                         my x-ray glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                         Here, use mine.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to use a cover name.  It's 
                         important that it be a generic name 
                         so that we don't draw attention to 
                         ourselves.

               INT.  CASINO

               Austin and Vanessa join the high-rollers table.  Number Two 
               is there, complete with eyepatch.  On one side of him is a 
               beautiful ITALIAN WOMAN (a la SOPHIA LOREN) in a white dress 
               with a white kerchief on her head.  On the other side of him 
               is an extremely large-breasted BIMBO.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do you mind if I join you?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Not at all.

               The DEALER deals.

                                     DEALER
                         Seventeen.

               Zoom in on Number Two's eyepatch.

               NUMBER TWO'S MONOCULAR POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  We see everyone at the casino 
               in their underwear.  He looks at the next card in the shoe.  
               It is a 4.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hit me.

                                     DEALER
                         You have seventeen, sir.  The book 
                         says not to, sir.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I like to live dangerously.

               The dealer draws a card from the card shoe.

                                     DEALER
                         Four.  Twenty-one.

               Everyone at the table applauds.  The dealer deals to Austin 
               and Number Two.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Eighteen.
                              (to Number Two)
                         Sixteen.

               NUMBER TWO'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY EYEPATCH".  He looks at the shoe at the 
               shoe and sees that the next card is a ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I'll stay.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

               Smugly, Austin puts on Vanessa's x-ray glasses.

               AUSTIN'S POV

               GRAPHIC:  "X-RAY SPECS".  Everyone is in their underwear, 
               but it is completely blurry.

                                     DEALER
                              (to Austin)
                         Sir?

                                     VANESSA
                              (quietly)
                         What's wrong?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (quietly, to Vanessa)
                         I can't see a bloody thing.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, I forgot to tell you, they're 
                         prescription X-ray glasses.  I have 
                         very bad astigmatism.

                                     DEALER
                         Sir, the table is waiting.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (panicking)
                         Uh, hit me.

               The table MURMURS.

                                     DEALER
                         On an eighteen, sir?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I also like to live dangerously.

               The dealer deals him the ten.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         You're very brave.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow 
                         myself to introduce...myself.  My 
                         name is Ritchie Cunningham.

               Vanessa is mortified.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (indicating Vanessa)
                         This is my wife, Enid.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My name is Number Two.

               He extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but 
               misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an 
               awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses.

                                     VANESSA
                              (rescuing him)
                         Number Two?  That's an unusual name.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My parents were hippies.

                         This is my Italian confidential 
                         secretary.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it.  
                         It sounds like you're saying your 
                         name is a lot of...never mind.  
                         Listen, cats, I'm going to crash.  
                         It's been a gas.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Peace, baby.

               Austin and Vanessa leave.

               INT.  CASINO

                                     VANESSA
                         Why did you leave so soon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That cat Number Two has an X-ray 
                         eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, 
                         man.  Listen, we should go back to 
                         the room, but first I have to go to 
                         the naughty chair and see a man about 
                         a dog.

               He heads to the rest room.

               INT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO

               Number Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON.

               INT.  BATHROOM - CASINO

               Austin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy 
               hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining 
               stall.

                                     TEXAN
                         Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy 
                         food, you rent it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Too right, youth.

               INT.  BATHROOM STALL

               Austin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing 
               Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks 
               back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it 
               around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the 
               wire and certain death.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (grunting)
                         Uh, uh!

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about 
               frantically.  He can hear the

               GRUNTING.

                                     TEXAN
                         Hey pardner, just relax, don't force 
                         it!  Use some creative visualization.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's 
               crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony.

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (groaning)
                         Ughhhhh...

               Austin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty 
               O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it 
               hovers above the toilet bowl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who does Number Two work for?

                                     TEXAN
                         That's right!  Show that turd who's 
                         boss!

               INT.  AUSITN'S STALL

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who does Number Two work for?

                                     PATTY O'BRIEN
                              (quietly, straining)
                         Go to hell.

               Austin drops Patty's head into the toilet and FLUSHES.  We 
               hear MUFFLED GURGLING SOUNDS from Patty O'Brien.

               INT.  TEXAN'S STALL

               The Texan hears all of this, and is now concerned.

               INT.  AUSTIN'S STALL

               Austin reaches into Patty O'Brien's wallet.  We see his Dr. 
               Evil ID card and Alotta's Virtucon business card with her 
               address.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin is leaving his stall.  The Texan can see Patty 
               O'Brien's dead body head-first in the toilet.

                                     TEXAN
                         Jesus Christ, what did you eat?

               ANGLE ON THE FLOOR OF AUSTIN'S STALL

               Patty O'Brien's lifeless hand hits the floor.  The charms 
               come tumbling out: a heart, a moon, a star, and a clover.  A 
               second later, a blue diamond falls out.

               Vanessa is on the phone on the bed sifting through photos 
               and files on Dr. Evil, Virtucon, etc.

               In the background, through an open door, we see that Austin 
               is asleep on the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                              (into phone)
                         Hello Mum?

               INT.  MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE - LONDON

               An older Mrs. Kensington sits in her suburban English front 
               room.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                              (on phone)
                         Oh, hello Vanessa.  How was the 
                         flight?

                                     VANESSA (V.O.)
                         Great.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         How's Austin?

                                     VANESSA (V.O.)
                         He's asleep.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         You didn't...

               INT.  HOTEL SUITE

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the 
                         couch.

               In the background, we see Austin get off the couch.  He is 
               very naked and very hairy.  A strategically placed vase of 
               flowers blocks his naughty bits from view.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I'm proud of you.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         Because you managed to resist Austin 
                         Power's charms.

               Austin moves towards the bathroom away from the flowers.  
               Right in the nick of time, Vanessa holds up a photo of Number 
               Two and looks at it, blocking his naughty parts.

                                     VANESSA
                         Well, God knows he tried, but I've 
                         been rather firm with him, Mummy.  
                         You didn't tell me he was so obsessed 
                         with sex.  It's bizarre.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         You can't judge him by modern 
                         standards.  He's very much a product 
                         of his times.  In my day he could 
                         have any woman he wanted.

                                     VANESSA
                         What about his teeth?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         You have to understand, in Britain 
                         in the Sixties you could be a sex 
                         symbol and still have bad teeth.  It 
                         didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         I just don't see it.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in 
                         his charms, it's impossible to get 
                         out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever...

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Of course not.  I was married to 
                         your father.

                                     VANESSA
                         Did you ever want to?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON
                         Austin is very charming, very 
                         debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has 
                         a knowledge of fine wines, 
                         sophisticated, a world-renowned 
                         photographer.  Women want hin, men 
                         want to be him.  He's a lover of 
                         love&emdash; every bit an 
                         International Man of Mystery.

               We hear the TOILET FLUSH.  Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the 
               screen.

               Austin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa 
               holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and 
               in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera.

                                     VANESSA
                         You didn't answer my question, Mum.

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         I know.  Let me just say this: Austin 
                         was the most loyal and caring friend 
                         I ever had.

               I will always love him.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Good morning, luv, who are you on

                         Do you want to talk to him?

                                     MRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.)
                         No, it's been too long.  Best to 
                         leave things alone.

                                     VANESSA

                              (to her mother)
                         Look, I'd better go.  I love you.

                         I love you, Vanessa.

               Vanessa hangs up.  Austin enters wearing an "Austin Powers" 
               robe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Good morning, Vanessa!  I hope you 
                         have on clean underwear.

                         Why?

                         We've got a doctor's 
                         appointment&emdash; an evil doctor's

               THROUGH BINOCULAR POV CUT-OUTS

               We see a black limousine pull up in front.  Random Task and 
               another BODYGUARD exit the limo and secure the area.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS - BUSHES

               We see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa.  She and Austin 
               are on a stakeout.  Austin's Jag is in the background.

                                     VANESSA
                         A limousine has just pulled up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me see.

               Austin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens 
               attached to his vintage camera.

               Number Two exits the building

               holding Mr. Bigglesworth, the hairless cat.  He's not happy 
               about this, and has a scratch on his cheek.

                         Hello, hello.  That's Dr. Evil's 
                         cat.

                                     VANESSA
                         How do you know?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I never forget a pussy...cat.

                         Let's go get him!

                                     AUSTIN
                         He's too well-protected right now.

                                     VANESSA
                         We can't just sit here, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let me tell you a story.  There's 
                         these two bulls on top of a hill 
                         checking out some foxy cows in the 
                         meadow below.  The young bull says, 
                         'hey, why don't we run down the hill 
                         and shag us a cow?', and the wise 
                         old bull replies, 'no, why don't we 
                         walk down the hill and shag all the 
                         cows?'

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't get it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, you know...cows, and shagging.

                                     VANESSA
                         Unfortunately, while you told that 
                         stupid story, Dr. Evil has escaped.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No worries, luv.  We'll just give 
                         Basil a tinkle on the telling bone...

               He notices the way the desert light catches her beauty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         My God, Vanessa, you are so incredibly 
                         beautiful.  Stay right where you 
                         are.

               Austin changes lenses and begins SNAPPING PICTURES.

                                     VANESSA
                         I hate having my picture taken.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're crazy.  The camera loves you, 
                         Vanessa.

               Vanessa does a few coy poses.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Go, Vanessa, go!

               Vanessa lets go a little bit more.

               WHITE CYC

               Austin and Vanessa are in the midst of a full professional 
               photo shoot, and she's loving it.

               Austin begins SNAPPING pictures, all the while changing her 
               look, touching her hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout 
                         for me Vanessa.  Smashing!  Crazy.  
                         Give me some shoulder.
                              (pause)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!

               He motions to her two top buttons of her blouse.  She nods 
               no.  Austin nods yes.  She sheepishly undoes them.  A MONTAGE 
               of her in various gowns, one more exotic and exciting than 
               the other.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Show me love.  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         Smashing!

               Vanessa is flanked by two buff MALE MODELS à la Madonna.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great!  Great!  Smashing!
                              (beat)
                         Yes!  Yes!  Yes!
                              (beat)
                         No!  No!

               Love it.  Give me love.  Give me mouth.  Give me lips.

                                     (BEAT)
                         Going in very close now.

               He goes in closer.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me eyes.
                              (closer)
                         Give me cornea.
                              (closer)
                         Give me aqueous humour.
                              (closer)
                         Coming in closer.  Give me retina, 
                         Vanessa.
                              (closer)
                         Even closer.  Give me optic nerve.
                              (beat)
                         Love it!
                              (beat)
                         And...done.

               He throws the camera down.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm spent.  What say you we go out 
                         on the town?

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT

               Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double-
               decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner.  
               They're drinking champagne.

               Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding 
               his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point 
               to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it 
               to her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fancy a nibble?

                                     VANESSA
                         I couldn't have another bite.

               They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them.

               They begin to dance.

               Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her.

               EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT

               They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying 
               each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She 
               graciously accepts.

               64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE

               Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of 
               backgrounds&emdash; neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, 
               etc.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM

               Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking 
               out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled 
               leg straining upwards.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Watch out, you're on my hair!

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Sorry.  Move your hand to the left.  
                         There you go.  Gorgeous.

                                     VANESSA (O.S.)
                         Go!  Just go!

               We hear a SPINNING SOUND.

                                     AUSTIN (O.S.)
                         Left hand, blue.

               We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She 
               reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait a tick, I forgot something in 
                         the lobby.
                              (moving behind the 
                              couch)
                         I know what.  I'll take the stairs.

               Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe I'll take the escalator.

               Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why take the escalator when I could 
                         take a canoe?

               Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch.

                                     VANESSA
                         I haven't had fun like that since 
                         college.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry.

                                     VANESSA
                         Why?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry that bug up your ass had 
                         to die.

               She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound.

                                     VANESSA
                         Always wanting to have fun, that's 
                         you in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, this is me in a nutshell.

               Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind 
                         of nut has such a big nutshell?  How 
                         did I get into this bloody great big 
                         nutshell?

               Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're smashed, Vanessa.

                                     VANESSA
                         I am not.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes you are.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm not.  I'm the sensible one.  I'm 
                         always the designated driver.

               They are both on the bed.  She looks at him.  He looks at 
               her.  There is an awkward silence.

               She's about to kiss him, then he pulls away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't.  You're drunk.

                                     VANESSA
                         It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just 
                         beginning to see what my Mum was 
                         talking about.
                              (pause)
                         What was my mother like back in the 
                         Sixties?  I'm dying to know.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (sentimental)
                         She was very groovy.  She was so in 
                         love with your Dad.  If there was 
                         one

               other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and 
               treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me.  But, 
               unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.

               Austin hears SNORING.  He looks over and sees Vanessa asleep.  
               A distinctive PHONE RINGS and a

               RED LIGHT FLASHES.

               Austin opens one of his funky suitcases to reveal a PICTURE 
               PHONE.  It's Basil Exposition, on an airplane.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on the picture phone)
                         Hello, Austin, this is Basil 
                         Exposition from British Intelligence.  
                         Thank you for confirming the link 
                         between Dr. Evil and Virtucon.  Find 
                         out what part Virtucon plays in 
                         something called Project Vulcan.  
                         I'll need you and Vanessa to get on 
                         that immediately.

               Austin looks at Alotta's Virtucon business card.

               INT.  ALOTTA'S JAPANESE STYLE PENTHOUSE

               Austin is in a dark penthouse suite.  Austin passes a piece 
               of art that is very suggestive of the female anatomy.

               He goes over to a credenza where there is a briefcase.  He 
               opens it.

               FULL SCREEN - DOCUMENT

               Austin's photographing the dossier with his miniature 
               camera/pendant.

                         Give it to me baby.  Super.

               We now see that the document outlines all of Virtucon's 
               holdings in a flow-chart fashion.

                                     AUSTIN

                         Yes!  Yes!  No!  No!

               One side of the chart is labeled "Secret Projects."  Under 
               that we see "Human Organ Trafficking", "Carrot Top Movie", 
               and in CLOSE-UP&emdash; "Project Vulcan."

               We see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a 
               cross-section of the earth labeled "Crust, Mantel, Core."

                         Virtucon's main interest is in cable 
                         television, but they do have a 
                         subterranean construction division,

                         It's for the mining industry, Mr. 
                         Cunningham.  We can talk about 
                         business later.  But first, let me 
                         slip into something more comfortable.

               Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she 
               takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair 
               of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto.

               INT.  JAPANESE BATH

               She slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on 
               her shoulder, and enters the water.

                         Come in.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'd rather talk about Number Two.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham?  
                         Come in, and I'll show you everything 
                         you need to know.

               Austin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He 
               goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over.

                                     ALOTTA
                         May I wash you?

                         Groovy.

               She washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his 
               wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION.  
               It reads "AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY."

               ANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC.  
               SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS

               trousers.

                         In Japan, men come first and women 
                         come second.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or sometimes not at all.

                         Care for some saki?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sak-i it to me!

               Alotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her 
               ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads "Relaxation 
               Pills."  She drops two PILLS into his drink.

               Austin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly 
               woozy.

                                     ALOTTA
                         How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?

                         Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation.

               A big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin.

               It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down

                         Gentlemen, Phase One is complete.  
                         The warhead is ours.  Let Phase Two 
                         begin!  Patch us through to the United 
                         Nations security secret meeting room.

               INT.  UN SECRET MEETING ROOM

               REPRESENTATIVES of various countries in their traditional 
               garb around a large UN-style meeting table.  The BRITISH are 
               dressed in bowler hats.  The AMERICANS all look like JFK.  
               The CANADIANS are dressed as Mounties.  The ARABS are dressed 
               in ceremonial robes, etc.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, my name is Dr. Evil.

               They all look up at the SCREEN.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         In a little while, you'll find out 
                         that the Kreplachistani warhead has 
                         gone missing.  Well, it's in safe 
                         hands.  If you want it back, you'll 
                         have to pay me...ONE MILLION DOLLARS!

               The UN representatives are confused.  Number Two COUGHS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (frustrated)
                         Sorry.  ONE-HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS!

               The representatives ARGUE amongst themselves.

                         Gentlemen, silence!
                              (to Dr. Evil)

               NOW, MR. EVIL&EMDASH;

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (angry)
                         Doctor Evil!  I didn't spend six 
                         years in evil medical school to be 
                         called 'mister'.

                                     UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
                         Excuse me.  Dr. Evil, it is the policy 
                         of the United Nations not to negotiate 
                         with terrorists.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen, 
                         you have five days to come up with 
                         one

               hundred billion dollars.  If you fail to do so, we'll set 
               off the warhead and destroy the world.

                                     UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY
                         You can't destroy the world with a 
                         single warhead.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?  So long.

               The screen goes BLANK.

                              (to evil associates)
                         Gentlemen, in exactly five days from 
                         now, we will be one-hundred billion 
                         dollars richer.
                              (laughing)
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha.
                              (slightly louder)
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha.

                              (laughing with him)
                         Ha-ha-ha-ha.

               DR. EVIL & ASSOCIATES

               (LOUDER AND MORE STACCATO)

               HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

               (louder again, and even more evil and maniacal)

               HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA-HA!

                                     (PAUSE)
                         Ohhhh, ahhhhhh...
                              (pause, quieter)
                         Ohhh, hmmmm.
                              (pause, very quiet)
                         hmn.

               There is an uncomfortable pause, because clearly we should 
               have FADED TO BLACK.  The evil associates look around the 
               room, not knowing what to do with themselves.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Okay...Well...I think I'm going to 
                         watch some TV.

                                     EVIL ASSOCIATES
                         Okay.  Sure.

               They exit the frame awkwardly.

               INT.  BRITISH MAKESHIFT HQ

               Austin and Vanessa enter past two BRITISH MILITARY POLICEMAN.  
               There is a communications center, a makeshift armory, bunks, 
               etc.

               We see Basil, dressed as the Vegas-era Elvis.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, Exposition.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, Vanessa, let me bring you up 
                         to speed.  Dr. Evil has high-jacked 
                         a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan 
                         and is holding the world ransom for 
                         one-hundred billion dollars.  If the 
                         world doesn't pay up in four days, 
                         he's threatening to destroy the world.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you, Exposition.  Only two 
                         things, scare me, and one is nuclear 
                         war.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's the other?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Excuse me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's the other thing you're scared 
                         of?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Carnies.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Circus folk.
                              (shudders)
                         Nomads, you know.  They smell like 
                         cabbage.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (suffering him)
                         Indeed...If we could get back to the 
                         business at hand.  It's one thing to 
                         have a warhead, it's quite another 
                         thing to have the missiles to launch 
                         it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Maybe these photographs are the last 
                         piece of that puzzle.
                              (hands him the photos)
                         I've uncovered the details on Project 
                         Vulcan.  It's a new subterranean 
                         warhead delivery system.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good God, and underground missile.  
                         We've long feared such a development.

                                     VANESSA
                         When did you find that out, Austin?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin did some reconnaissance work 
                         at Alotta Fagina's penthouse last 
                         night.

                                     VANESSA
                         Oh.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITON
                         Our next move is to infiltrate 
                         Virtucon.  Any ideas?

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes, Virtucon runs a tour of their 
                         facilities every hour.  I suggest we 
                         pose as tourists and do site-level 
                         reconnaissance.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Top drawer, Kensington.  Oh, Austin, 
                         I want you to meet somebody.

               Basil waves to an extremely frail ELDERLY BRITISH LADY.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, this is my mother, Mrs. 
                         Exposition.  She's in from Tunbridge 
                         Wells

               in Kent.  Can you believe, she's ninety-two years old?

               Austin hauls off and PUNCHES the lady in the face.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         My God, Austin, what have you done?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not your mother, that's a 
                         man!

               Austin begins tugging on her hair.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                         Owww...my hair!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Get away from my mother!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, have you gone mad?

               The two guards come over and help Mrs. Exposition to a cot.

                                     MRS. EXPOSITION
                              (through pain)
                         Who is that man?  Why did he hit me?

                                     BASIL EXPOSIION
                         Don't worry, mother.  Lie down.  
                         Austin, you have a lot of explaining 
                         to do.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was 
                         a man.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Damn it, man!  You're talking about 
                         my mother!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You must admit, she is rather mannish.  
                         No offense, but if that's a woman, 
                         it looks like she's been beaten with 
                         an ugly stick.

                                     VANESSA
                         Really, Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Look at her hands, baby!  Those are 
                         carpenter's hands.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         All right, Austin, I think you should 
                         go.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think if everyone were honest, 
                         they'd confess that the lady looks 
                         exactly like a man in drag.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm leaving!
                              (pause)
                         Oh, and Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, Basil?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Be careful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thanks.

               Basil escorts his mother out.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, may I have a word with you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Listen, I know I'm just being 
                         neurotic, but I can't shake this 
                         suspicious

               feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I 
               don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad 
               relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues.  
               You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to 
               give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this 
               weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't be sorry.  You're right to be 
                         suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged 
                         her rotten.

                                     VANESSA
                              (stunned)
                         I can't believe you made love to her 
                         just like that.  Did you use 
                         protection?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course, I had my nine-millimeter 
                         automatic.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, did you use a condom?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Only sailors use condoms, man.

                                     VANESSA
                         Not in the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well they should, filthy beggars, 
                         they go from port to port.  Alotta 
                         meant nothing to me.

                                     VANESSA
                              (pause)
                         Well, it means something to me.  If 
                         you want us to have a relationship, 
                         you've got to be a one-woman man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're 
                         everything to me.

                                     VANESSA
                         You just don't get it, do you, Austin?  
                         Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, 
                         you're going to be very lonely.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               MUSIC:  "What the World Needs Now" by BURT BACHARACH Austin 
               looks at his address book.  ANGLE ON THE PAGE:  We see a 
               list of names crossed out, with

               comments written in beside them.  Beside Jimi Hendrix we see 
               "Deceased, Drugs"; Janis Joplin, "Deceased, Alcohol"; Mama 
               Cass, "Deceased, Ham Sandwich"; Jerry Garcia. "Deceased, 
               Gratefully"; Jane Fonda, "Square".

               Austin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers.  
               He picks up his new pair&emdash; REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER 
               PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode.

               Austin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We 
               see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S 
               and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS.

               Austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened 
               Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It 
               explodes in a shower of sparks and soup.

               He puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The 
               NOISE is awful.

               Austin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head 
               ripped off, and blood spews out.

               Austin is genuinely frightened by this.

               INT.  BATHROOM

               Austin attempts to use the Water Pik, but the head is too 
               loose and water shoots all around the bathroom.

               EXT.  CAR - STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

               Austin drives alone and sad against the rear-projection of 
               Las Vegas.

               INT.  CASINO BAR - NIGHT

               Austin drinks by himself while a gaggle of EIGHT CONTEMPORARY 
               YOUNG PEOPLE IN LOVE cavort.  They look at him like he's a 
               freak.

               Austin raises a bottle of ZIMA as if to say "hey, I'm down 
               with that".  They shoot him sarcastic peace signs.  Austin 
               is pleased.

               INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Austin sits watching the TIME-LIFE The Last Thirty Years 
               video on TV.  Vanessa enters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, luv.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thirty years of political and social 
                         upheaval.  The fall of the Berlin 
                         wall, a female Prime Minister of 
                         England, the abolishment of Apartheid, 
                         a fascinating tapestry of human strum 
                         und drang.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was 
                         gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't 
                         see that one coming.

                                     VANESSA
                         Basil was very concerned to know 
                         where you were last night.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Out and about, doing odds and sods.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'll tell him.  By the way, I've 
                         decided we should keep our 
                         relationship strictly professional.

               INT.  THERAPIST'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

               We're in the middle of a group therapy session, containing 
               six or seven FATHERS with their teenage SONS.  It is 
               emotionally charged.  A lot of pained expressions and coffee 
               in Styrofoam cups.

                                     SON 1
                              (crying)
                         I love you, Dad.

                                     DAD 1
                         I love you, Son.

               They hug.  Everyone APPLAUDS.  We see Dr. Evil and Scott.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That was great, Mr. Keon, Dave.  
                         Thank you.  OK, group, we have two 
                         new member.  Say hello to Scott and 
                         his father, Mr....Ehville?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Evil, actually, Doctor Evil.

                                     GROUP
                         Hello, Dr. Evil.  Hello, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (into it)
                         Hello, everybody.

                                     THERAPIST
                         So, Scott, why don't we start with 
                         you.  Why are you here?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, it's kind of weird.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't judge here.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         OK.  Well, I just really met my Dad 
                         for the first time three days ago.  
                         He was partially frozen for thirty 
                         years.  I never knew him growing up.  
                         He comes back and now he wants me to 
                         take over the family business.

                                     THERAPIST
                         And how do you feel about that?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't wanna take over the family 
                         business.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         But Scott, who's going to take over 
                         the world when I die?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Not me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         What do you want to do, Scott?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I don't know.  I was thinking, maybe 
                         I'd be a vet or something, cause I 
                         like animals and stuff.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil vet?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No.  Maybe, like, work in a petting 
                         zoo or something.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         An evil petting zoo?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                              (shouting)
                         You always do that!
                              (calm)
                         Anyways, this is really hard, because, 
                         you know, my Dad is really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We don't label people here, Scott.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         No, he's really evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Scott.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, the boy's right.  I really am 
                         evil.

                                     THERAPIST
                         Don't be so hard on yourself.  You're 
                         here, that's what's important.  A 
                         journey of a thousand miles begins 
                         with one step.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I just think, like, he hates me.  I 
                         really think he wants to kill me.

                                     THERAPIST
                         OK, Scott, no one really wants to 
                         "kill" anyone here.  They say it, 
                         but they don't mean it.

               The group LAUGHS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, the boy's quite astute.  I 
                         am trying to kill him.  My Evil 
                         Associates have cautioned against 
                         it, so here he is, unfortunately, 
                         alive.

                                     THERAPIST
                         We've heard from Scott, now let's 
                         hear from you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         The details of my life are quite 
                         inconsequential.

                                     THERAPIST
                         That's not true, Doctor.  Please, 
                         tell us about your childhood.

                                     GROUP
                         Yes, of course.  Go ahead, etc.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Very well, where should I begin?  My 
                         father was a relentlessly self-
                         improving boulangerie owner from 
                         Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy 
                         and a penchant for buggery.  My mother 
                         was a fifteen-year-old French 
                         prostitute named Chloe with webbed 
                         feet.  My father would womanize, he 
                         would drink, he would make outrageous 
                         claims, like he invented the question 
                         mark.  Sometimes he would accuse 
                         chestnuts of being lazy.  A sort of 
                         general malaise that only the genius 
                         possess and the insane lament.  My 
                         childhood was typical.

               Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons.  In the spring we'd make 
               meat helmets.  If I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap 
               bag and beaten with reeds.  Pretty standard, really.  At the 
               age of twelve I received my first scribe.  At the

               age of fifteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically 
               shaved my testicles.  There really is nothing like a shawn 
               scrotum.  At the age of eighteen, I went off to evil medical 
               school.  From there...

               ANGLE ON THE THERAPIST AND THE GROUP.  They are stunned.

               A TOUR is in progress.  Austin, Vanessa, and other TOURISTS 
               ride on an electric tram.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Since I've been unfrozen, I've had a 
                         rancid taste in my mouth.  Do you 
                         have a piece of gum?

                                     VANESSA
                              (in her own world)
                         Do you think she's prettier than I?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who?

                                     VANESSA
                         You know who.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No!  Don't lay your hang-ups on me, 
                         Vanessa.  You're being very trippy.

                                     VANESSA
                         I'm looking at you, and the whole 
                         time I can't help thinking you had 
                         your willie inside her hootchie-kooch.

                                     AUSTTIN
                         Well put.  Listen love, we can't 
                         keep having this fight.  I'm an 
                         International Man of Mystery.  
                         Sometimes in the course of my work 
                         to save the world I have to shag 
                         some crumpet.  It's all part of the 
                         job.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Welcome to Virtucon, the company of 
                         the future.
                              (pointing to large 
                              display window)
                         Virtucon is a leading manufacturer 
                         of many items you'll find right in 
                         your own home.  We make steel, 
                         volatile chemicals, petroleum-based 
                         products, and we also own the Franklin 
                         mint, which makes decorative hand-
                         painted theme plates for collectors.
                              (holds up plate)
                         Some plates, like the Gone With The 
                         Wind series, have gone up in value 
                         as much as two-hundred and forty 
                         percent, but, as with any investment, 
                         there is some risk involved.

               The people on the tour APPLAUD.

                                     TOUR GUIDE
                         Coming up on the left, we have the 
                         Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide 
                         range of Virtucon licensed products.  
                         On the right, you'll notice a door 
                         that leads to a restricted area.  
                         Only authorized personnel are allowed 
                         beyond that point.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA

               All the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a 
               SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the "RESTRICTED AREA" with 
               a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear 
               Virtucon coveralls.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll take him, you take her.

               The seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; 
               the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin 
               and Vanessa follow.

               We hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING 
               KNOCKED OUT.

               Austin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls 
               over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly.   
               They go through the doors into the restricted area.

               INT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA

               They approach the security GUARD.

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, we don't look anything like 
                         our photo badges.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a 
                         mind control technique during my 
                         travels to India.  I learned it from 
                         my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a 
                         chaste man who mysteriously died of 
                         a disease that had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis.

               Just watch me.  Watch me, now.

               They reach the guard.

                                     GUARD
                         Hi, folks.  You're entering a 
                         restricted zone.  Can I see your 
                         security badges?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               They flash their security badges to the guard.

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, 
               RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE

               other, back and forth.

               MUSIC:  Mystical Indian sitar.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hypnotist-like)
                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     GUARD
                              (looking at the badges)
                         Hey, wait a minute&emdash;

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like, in 
                              Austin's English 
                              accent)
                         Everything seems to be in order.

                                     VANESSA
                         That's amazing.  Let's go!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on one second.

               Austin again does his mind control trick.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

                                     GUARD
                              (in trace)
                         Here, have a piece of gum.

               He hands Austin a piece of gum.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't mind if I do.

                                     GUARD
                              (slipping out of trance)
                         Hey!  Wait a minute, that's my last 
                         piece of gum.

               Austin does his mind-control again.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     GUARD
                              (trance-like)
                         No, no, I want you to have it, even 
                         if it's my last piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (mind-controlling)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

                                     VANESSA
                              (irritated)
                         Austin, we have to go!

               She pulls him away.

                                     GUARD (O.S.)
                              (faintly)
                         I'm going to go across the street 
                         and get you some sherbert.

               Austin and Vanessa come to a door marked "PROJECT VULCAN - 
               TOP SECRET."  They walk through.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               Inside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits 
               surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         This is the strongest, sharpest drill 
                         bit ever produced by man.  It weighs 
                         fifteen metric tones and can bore 
                         through a mile-thick bedrock of solid 
                         granite in seven seconds.

               INT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM

               A SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count.  They 
               notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram.  The 
               guard speaks into his walkie-talkie.

               INT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM

               SFX:  ALARM GOES OFF

                                     ANNOUNCER
                              (on PA)
                         Attention, there are intruders in 
                         the complex.

               All the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin 
               and Vanessa.

                                     SCIENTIST
                         Get them!

               The scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold 
               with judo chops.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!  Judo chop!

               Vanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks.  
               SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin 
               and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads 
               "VIRTUCON

               STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY."

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               It is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a 
               large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test 
               track very slowly.

               Austin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving 
               steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin 
               fanning out in a search.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Our only way out of here is to drive 
                         out!

               They climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, 
               push him off, and assume the controls.

                                     P.A. (O.S.)
                         There they are!

               Two SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller.  
               Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away.  
               Austin punches the other one off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hang on!  I'm going to floor it!

               He engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster.

               TWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They 
               are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a 
               fast-approaching car.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Where did you learn to shoot?

                                     VANESSA
                         Where did you learn to drive?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY 
               AS IF "IN THE NICK OF TIME."  THE

               steamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still 
               frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

                                     VANESSA
                         Austin, watch out!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Where?  Where?

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE 
               STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS

               away.

                                     GUARD
                         Noooooooooooooo!

               ANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING 
               THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO

               downshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along 
               with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks.

               ANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE 
               STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF

               blood and guts.

               By now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run 
               out into the hallway.

               INT.  HALLWAY

               The coast is clear.

                                     VANESSA
                         Thank God, Austin, we made it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, act naturally and we'll split 
                         this scene the way we came in, 
                         Vanessa.

               From behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is 
               Random Task flanked by four SECURITY

               GUARDS.

               INT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY

               We see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood 
               and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns 
               to reveal "Steamroller Accident Response Team" written on 
               his jumpsuit.

               Another WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and 
               dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled 
               Army guy's ID tag, which reads "STEVE HARWIN."

               EXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES

               It is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We 
               hear a PHONE RINGING.

               INT.  KITCHEN

               A pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone.

                                     MIDDLE AGED LADY
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin.
                              (pause)
                         Yes, that's right, he's a henchman 
                         in Dr. Evil's Private Army.

               She HANGS UP.  A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters.

                         Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home?  
                         He said he was going to teach me to 
                         play ball.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Sit down, Billy, I have some bad 
                         news.  As you know, your brother 
                         Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's 
                         Private Army.

                                     BILLY
                         Was?  What is it, Mom?

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         Your brother was run over by a 
                         steamroller.

                                     BILLY
                         A steamroller?
                              (bursting into tears)
                         No, not Steve!  Since Dad died, 
                         Steve's been like a father to me.

                                     MRS. HARWIN
                         I'm sorry son.  People never think 
                         how things affect the family of the 
                         henchman.
                              (hugging him)
                         I love you, Billy.
                              (to herself, out loud)
                         I wonder if we'll be able to receive 
                         Steve's henchman's comp.

               We see a Virtucon electric minivan humning along.

               INT.  BACK OF ELECTRIC MINIVAN

               Austin and Vanessa are unconscious.

               EXT.  HIGHWAY

               The electric minivan turns onto a dirt road that leads to a 
               boulder.

               EXT.  DESERT - BOULDER

               The boulder lifts up and the minivan drives into it.

               INT.  UNDERGROUND TUNNEL

               The minivan enters a long cylindrical tunnel.

               The minivan is being lowered on a high-speed elevator.

               INT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER

               VIRTUCON ARMY MEMBERS keep watch.  SCIENTISTS check

                         Frau Farbissina, check on our guests.

               The electric minivan pulls up right next to the immense table.  
               All the evil associates are present.  Dr. Evil squeezes a 
               tennis ball repeatedly.  Frau Farbissina opens the rear hatch 
               of the minivan and pulls out Austin and Vanessa.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my underground lair, Mr. 
                         Powers.  Mrs. Kensington's daughter, 
                         how lovely.  I believe your name is 
                         Vanessa?  I'd shake your hands, except 
                         for obvious reasons.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't understand.

                         My hand, dammit!  Look at it!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What's wrong with your hand?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't try to suck up to me!  It's a 
                         little late for that.  I'm a freak!

               Look at it, it's been rendered useless.

               He moves his arm around to show them, but it's virtually 
               normal, just slightly aged.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm sorry, baby, I'm just not grocking 
                         your head space.

                         the international stage, Mr. Powers, 
                         I'm sure you'll enjoy watching the 
                         curtain fall on the third and final 
                         act.

               He presses a button on his chair panel.  A giant canvas falls, 
               unveiling an ultra-high tech diamond-bladed subterranean 
               bore&emdash; the VULCAN.  It is rather phallic.

                         Does that make you horny?

                         So powerful it can penetrate the 
                         Earth's crust, delivering a 50 kiloton 
                         nuclear warhead into the planet's 
                         hot liquid core.  Upon detonation, 
                         every volcano on the planet will 
                         erupt.

                         He's only got one warhead and he's 
                         going to detonate it deep underground.

                         My God, man, don't you understand?  
                         It won't just be active volcanoes, 
                         inactive ones will erupt as well.

                         clotted cream, the diving mystery of

                         the continuity of Britannic majesty, 
                         the demise of this sceptered isle,

                         I think you'll enjoy the food.  I 
                         have the best chef in the world.  
                         His name is Ezekial.  He's made of

                         Scott my boy, come here.  How was 
                         your day?

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Well, me and a buddy went to the 
                         video arcade in town and, like, they 
                         don't speak English right, and so my 
                         buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 
                         'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't 
                         speak French or whatever', and the 
                         other guy goes something in Paris 
                         talk, and I go 'um, just back off' 
                         and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make 
                         me'.

                         Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's

                         Why are you feeding him?  Why don't 
                         you just kill him?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         In due time.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         But what if he escapes?  Why don't 
                         you just shoot him?  What are you 
                         waiting for?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have a better idea.  I'm going to 
                         put him in an easily-escapable 
                         situation involving an overly-
                         elaborate and exotic death.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Why don't you just shoot him now?  
                         Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just 
                         shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         One more peep out of you and you're 
                         grounded.  Let's begin.

               A PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil 
               hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of 
                         mine are joining us for dinner.

               They're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.

               The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts 
               them in the dipping mechanism.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil, do you really expect them 
                         to pay?

                         No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to 
                         die.  Even after they pay me the 
                         money, I'm still going to melt all 
                         the cities of the world with hot 
                         magma.
                              (to guard)
                         All right, guard, begin the 
                         unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping 
                         Mechanism.

               The guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly 
               towards the surface of the water.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Release the sharks!
                              (to the room)
                         All the sharks have had laser beams 
                         attached to their heads.  I figure 
                         every creature deserves a warm meal.

                              nervously)
                         Dr. Evil?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting 
                         my moment of triumph.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         It's about the sharks.  Since you 
                         were frozen, they've been placed on 
                         the Endangered Species List.  We 
                         tried to get some, but it will take 
                         months to clear up the red tape.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (disappointed)
                         Right.
                              (to Austin)
                         Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you 
                         in a tank of piranhas with laser 
                         beams attached to their heads.

               Frau clears her throat again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What is it now?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Well, we experimented with lasers, 
                         but you would be surprised at how 
                         heavy they are.  They actually 
                         outweighed the piranha themselves, 
                         and the fish, well, they sank to the 
                         bottom and died.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have one simple request&emdash; 
                         sharks with friggin' laser beams 
                         attached to their heads, and it can't 
                         be done?  Remind me again why I pay 
                         you people?

               What do we have?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right.

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         They're mutated sea bass.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?  Are they ill-tempered?

                                     FRAU FARBISSINA
                         Please allow me to demonstrate.

               Frau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope 
               towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch 
               through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls 
               the rope back.  The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill-
                         tempered sea bass it is.
                              (to the room)
                         Come, let's return to dinner.  Close 
                         the tank.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Aren't you going to watch them?  
                         They'll get away!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, we'll leave them alone and not 
                         actually witness them dying, and 
                         we'll just assume it all went to 
                         plan.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I have a gun in my room.  Give me 
                         five seconds, I'll come back and 
                         blow their brains out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No Scott.  You just don't get it, do 
                         you?

               Dr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the 
               tank.

               INT.  TANK AREA

               Austin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They 
               can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them.

                                     VANESSA
                         What's your plan?

               Just then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing 
               Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         First, I plan to soil myself.  Then, 
                         I plan to regroup and think about 
                         the next move.  Any thoughts?

                                     VANESSA
                         Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep 
                         this on me just in case.

               She pulls out a container of dental floss.

                                     AUSTIN
                         All right, I get it.  I have bad 
                         teeth.  You have to understand, in 
                         Britain in the Sixties you could be 
                         a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  
                         It didn't matter.

                                     VANESSA
                         No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to 
                         get to the ledge.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing idea!  Give it to me.

               Austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental 
               floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo.  
               He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches 
               like a grappling hook.

               Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack.  
               Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the 
               sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the 
               floss.  He keeps pulling out floss.

               More floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, 
               the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the 
               pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his 
               hand like a surgeon&emdash;

               Vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile 
               the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the 
               open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES 
               at the guard loudly.  He turns around.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Judo chop!

               Austin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of 
               toothpaste into the guard's eyes.

                                     GUARD
                              (screaming, rubbing 
                              his eyes)
                         My eyes!  My eyes!

               Austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing 
               both ends.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hold on, Vanessa!

               She grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety 
               right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water.  
               Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared 
               all over his face.

               He and Austin STRUGGLE.

               The guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's 
               head dangling over the water.  SEA

               BASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's 
               head.

                                     VANESSA
                              (shouting)
                         Austin, watch out!

               Austin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's 
               head off like a blender.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Not a good time to lose one's head.

                                     VANESSA
                         Indeed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not the way to get ahead in 
                         life.

                                     VANESSA
                         Yes.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's a shame he wasn't more 
                         headstrong.

                                     VANESSA
                         Shut up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fair enough.

               They head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The 
               name tag reads "JOHN SMITH."

               It is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad 
               BUSTY WAITRESSES.

               INT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT

               At a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, 
               scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer.

                                     GUY 1
                         I can't believe John Smith is getting 
                         married tomorrow.

                                     GUY 2
                         Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not 
                         like him to be late for anything, 
                         especially his own stag party.

                                     GUY 3
                         Well, you know he's a henchman for 
                         Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late.  
                         Can I just say something that may 
                         sound a little sappy?  I think it's 
                         a testament to our friend John that 
                         so many of his buddies showed up in 
                         his honor.  There's a lot of love in 
                         this room.

               A large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone.

                                     WAITRESS
                         Hi, I have a phone call here for the 
                         John Smith party.

                                     GUY 1
                         Hello?
                              (pause)
                         Yes, I have a friend named John Smith.
                              (pause)
                         That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's 
                         private army.
                              (pause)
                         What?  He's dead?
                              (pause)
                         Decapitated by mutated flying sea 
                         bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you.

               He hangs up.

                              (to Guy 1)
                         Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that 
                         John?  Is he coming late?

                                     GUY 1
                         Guys, John's not coming.

                                     GUY 2
                         Why?

                                     GUY 1
                         He was decapitated by mutated flying 
                         sea bass.

                                     GUYS

                         All right, to Smittie!

               Everyone raises their glasses.

                                     GUYS

               He runs towards to door to exit.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEMALE 
               LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's neck and lift him up.  
               His feet leave the floor.

               Another FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin.  Nozzles pop out of 
               the tips of the Fembot's bra.

               A cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles.  Austin

               dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches 
               out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his 
               mouth and lights them with a blowtorch.

               He throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands 
               perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the 
               remaining cigarette.

               Austin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are 
               aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, 
               and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot.

               She begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and 
               forth like in Jacob's Ladder.

               Eventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down 
               to his Union Jack bikini briefs and

               turns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.

               He takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.  
               Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his 
               bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain.

               He mouths "I love you" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes.  
               He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, 
               whose head explodes.

               Austin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes.  
               Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining

                         Evil Doctor.

                         I'll secure the perimeter.

               INT.  CONTROL AREA

               Austin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires 
               at him.  Austin returns fires, shooting up some electrical 
               equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr.

               Bigglesworth running out a read door.

                                     DR. EVIL (O.S.)
                         Come, Mr. Bigglesworth!

               Austin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE 
               FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned 
               computers labeled "DESTRUCTACON 5000".

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the 
                         Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed 
                         to prevent you from progressing beyond 
                         this point.  You might as well 
                         surrender.  Resistance is futile.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, Destructacon 5000, you have 
                         quite a head on your shoulders, I 
                         dare to coin.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Yes, I am programmed to answer any 
                         question.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?  Let me ask you this.  What 
                         is love?

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         That does not compute.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why not?  It's a question.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)
                         Love is...love is...love is...

               The computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring.

                                     DESTRUCTACON (V.O.)

               There is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin 
               passes through the force field and heads for the door until 
               he hears&emdash;

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN

               He begins looking furiously for the abort button.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to Eastern European 
                              Man)
                         Where's the abort button?

               The Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 
               'give me one second.'

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN

                              (to Austin)
                         It's right over there.

               Austin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just 
               then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot 
               him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off 
               his SHOE.

               Austin makes his way across the room to the button.

               Random Task THROWS HIS SHOE.

               ANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR

               The shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe 
               has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to 
                         have a lump there, you idiot!  Who 
                         throws a shoe?  You fight like a 
                         woman.

                                     EASTERN EUROPEAN MAN

                         Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting.

               Random task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands 
               there, menacing, missing one shoe.

               Exposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin 
               is a Big Gulp.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for a drink?

               Austin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in 
               front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels 
               through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING 
               him.

               He begins to SMOKE, and then dies.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shocking.

               Austin dives in SLOW MOTION towards the abort button.  He 
               flies through the air for an inordinate length of time.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (slow motion distortion)
                         Nooooooo!

               His hand lands on the button.

               Having saved the world, Austin picks up a MACHIEN GUN from a 
               fallen Private Army guy and runs to the door at the back, 
               chasing Dr. Evil.

               Austin bursts in, catching Dr. Evil packing a suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got you, Dr. Evil!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so 
                         different, you and I.  It's true, 
                         you're British, and I'm Belgian.  
                         You have a full head of hair, mine 
                         is slightly receding.  You're thin, 
                         I'm about forty pounds overweight.  
                         OK, we are different, I'm not making 
                         a very good point.  However, isn't 
                         it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very 
                         things you stand for&emdash; swinging, 
                         free love, parties, distrust of 
                         authority- are all now, in the 
                         Nineties, considered to

               be...evil?  Maybe we have more in common than you care to 
               admit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, man, what we swingers were 
                         rebelling against were uptight squares 
                         like you, whose bag was money and 
                         world domination.  We were innocent, 
                         man.  If we'd known the consequences 
                         of our sexual liberation, we would 
                         have done things differently, but 
                         the spirit would have remained the 
                         same.  It's freedom, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Your freedom has cause more pain and 
                         suffering in the world than any plan 
                         I ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom 
                         failed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's why right now is a very groovy 
                         time, man.  We still have freedom, 
                         but we also have responsibility.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really, there's nothing more pathetic 
                         than an aging hipster.

               Alotta enters.  She holds a gun to Vanessa's head.

                                     ALOTTA
                         Not so fast.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, it seems the tables have turned, 
                         Mr. Powers.

               Just then, Scott Evil enters.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right?

               Austin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It seems the tables have turned again, 
                         Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Not really.  Kill the little bastard.  
                         See what I care.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Man, you are one chilly square!

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         Dad, we just made a breakthrough in 
                         group!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I had the group liquidated, you little 
                         shit.  They were insolent.

                                     SCOTT EVIL
                         I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I 
                         was never artificially created in a 
                         lab.

                         Scott, don't say that...

               Scott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun 
               out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls out a knife.  Austin 
               SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by 
               the throat.

                                     VANESSA
                         This is for sleeping with my man, 
                         you whore!

                                     ALOTTA
                         I didn't sleep with him.

                                     VANESSA
                         I don't believe you.

                                     ALOTTA

                         It's the teeth.

                                     VANESSA
                         OK, I believe you.  But you still 
                         must be chopped.

               Vanessa gives her a judo chop.

                                     VANESSA
                         Judo chop!

               Meanwhile, Dr. Evil has run to the egg shaped rocket, which 
               closes and begins to lift up through

               A HOLE IN THE CEILING.  HE RUNS IN.  ON THE WAY, HE FLIPS A

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's fab, because I love you, too, 
                         Vanessa.

                         Kiss me.

                         Behave!

               Austin and Vanessa draw towards each other, preparing for a 
               passionate kiss.  Just as their lips are about to touch, 
               however, they are interrupted by a strong WIND and the noise 
               of a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD.  Their hair is blown all about and 
               the waves are whipped into a frenzy.

                         Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. 
                         Evil from destroying the world with 
                         his subterranean nuclear probe, and 
                         somehow you and Agent Kensington 
                         managed to escape unscathed from his 
                         evil lair.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'd say that about sums it up, 
                         Exposition.

                         have something for you.

                         a swinging spy from the Sixties, was 
                         unfrozen in the Nineties to battle 
                         his archenemy Dr.  Evil. Austin foiled 
                         Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear 
                         warhead to the center of the earth 
                         and banished him into space forever.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Machine gun jubblies, how did I miss 
                         those?

                                     VANESSA
                              (robot voice)
                         PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD TRY 
                         FOREPLAY.

               Her machine gun breasts FIRE, spraying the room in SLO-MO.

               Then they run out of ammo and CLICK, CLICK.

               Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail. She 
               rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail. 
               Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.

               She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

               Fembot parts fly around the room. Austin sits on the bed, 
               saddened. He holds Vanessa's hand, which has wires hanging 
               out of it. On one of the fingers is her wedding ring.

               MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO

                                     AUSTIN
                              (very sad)
                         I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, 
                         my one true love, the woman who taught 
                         me the beauty of sharing your whole 
                         life with another, the person who 
                         taught me the meaning of love, was a 
                         Fembot. How will I ever go on?
                              (beat)
                         Wait a tic! That means I'm single! 
                         Oh, behave!

               INT. LOBBY - HOTEL

               Rich European guests mill about the luxurious lobby. Suddenly, 
               Austin dances through naked. Just as we are about to see his 
               bits and pieces, a man lifts up his suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and 
                         free!

               SEQUENCE CREDIT

               MUSIC: Soul Bassanova by QUINCY JONES PAN UP Austin's NAKED 
               body as he walks down a boardwalk. Just as the camera reaches 
               that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears STARRING MIKE 
               MYERS. Austin gives a big 'who me?' and we

               FREEZE FRAME.

               EXT. BOARDWALK - FRENCH RIVERA

               European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind. 
               His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves 
               away. Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed-

               A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around 
               to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!' 
               take and we FREEZE FRAME.

               A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a 
               credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!

               Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns, 
               followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.

               A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude 
               Beach". Austin enters from the left.

               We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he 
               is about to appear from behind the sign, a...

               CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis 
               lengthwise as he walks.

               NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE

               A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her 
               bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be 
               suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.

               The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl. 
               The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit 
               "BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the 
               "PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.

               Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS 
               appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of 
               nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing 
               CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.

               A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are 
               blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.

               Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out 
               from his waist. Austin looks proud.

               A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier 
               weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND 
               MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.

               Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit 
               "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits 
               in mid-air:

               FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING" 
               AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."

               Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shaguar, baby, yeah!

               CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar" 
               where it would normally read "Jaguar".

               The car speeds off.

               FULL SCREEN TV JERRY SPRINGER SHOW

               On the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son, 
               a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and SCOTT EVIL all seated on 
               a panel.

               Lower Third Chyron: "MY FATHER IS EVIL AND WANTS TO TAKE 
               OVER THE WORLD"  JERRY SPRINGER

               If you just joined us, today's topic is "my father is evil 
               and wants to take over the world". Now, Bobby, you had 
               something you wanted to share with your father before the 
               break.

                                     BOBBY
                         Dad, I know you're against race mixing 
                         and all that, but I met someone...

                                     KLANSMAN
                         Don't say it!

               The crowd WHOOPS.

                                     BOBBY
                         I met someone... and he's black.

               The crowd goes crazy.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         He?

               The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Please welcome Tim.

               A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the 
               Klansman's son. The crowd screams.

               JERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Now Scott, tell us about your father. 
                         Share with us.

                                     SCOTT
                         Well he's the head of an evil 
                         organization that has aspirations 
                         for world domination.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         And where is your father right now?

                                     SCOTT
                         He's in outer space, like frozen in 
                         a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big 
                         Boy rocket with his cat, Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Really? Well, we have a surprise for 
                         you, Scott. Let's bring out

                                     SCOTT'S
                         father, Dr Evil.

               Dr Evil enters.

               Lower Third Chyron: "WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD"

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Hello Scott, I'm back.

                                     SCOTT
                         I can't believe you'd do this to me 
                         on national television!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         They offered me a free makeover.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the 
                         fathers here today open up to their 
                         sons, sons to the fathers. Is there 
                         anything you'd like to share?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Share?

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Yes, don't you have any secrets?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK. I have a vestigial tail.

               Everyone is a little grossed out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine 
                         just goes on a little longer than it 
                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, 
                         perform fellatio once and you're a 
                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. 
                         I remember once I was being fisted 
                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where 
                         the story gets interesting. He was 
                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red 
                         meat all night long, but one sip of 
                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I 
                         remember we were caught in fragrance 
                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you 
                         can imagine my humiliation at having 
                         Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no 
                         teeth." One of my greatest 
                         disappointments is that I never became 
                         a song and dance man. I could have 
                         been a quadruple threat, kind of 
                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, 
                         singer, actor, and I would possess 
                         nuclear weapons, the latter being 
                         the most threatening of the four. I 
                         once sat on a bus and tried to will 
                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended 
                         up with was a sense of failure and a 
                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth 
                         and perhaps a grudging respect for 
                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. 
                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I 
                         slept in a horse once. It was quite 
                         roomy. On second thought, it was the 
                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' 
                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I 
                         wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the 
                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I 
                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy 
                         of The Fonze while I was in coma 
                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer 
                         hash, but who at the end of the day 
                         can honestly say they haven't done 
                         that?

               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once 
               quiet.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         What are you, some kind of freak?

                                     SCOTT
                         Shut up, jagoff!

               Studio audience whoops at this.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         I'll kick your ass punk!

               Crowd goes crazy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No one talks to my boy that way!

               Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.  
               Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm OK, I'm OK.

               There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking 
               him down.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new 
                         evil lair.

               EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY

               We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the 
               top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and 
               the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.

               INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM

               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks 
               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, 
               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is 
               a Starbucks.

               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and 
               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW 
               HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot 
               coffee products.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman 
                         of your organization, I seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         Seattle-based coffee company several 
                         years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-
                         flung empire with 2000 outlets 
                         worldwide.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a 
                         good cuppa joe.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         If I may continue, I believe if we 
                         shift our resources away from world 
                         domination and focus on providing 
                         premium quality coffee drinks, we 
                         can increase our gross profits 
                         fivefold.

               Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY 
               MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Perhaps you've confused me 
                         with someone who gives a shit.  Might 
                         I remind you that I run the show 
                         here? I demand a little respect.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (indicating Dr. Evil's 
                              milk mustache)
                         Dr. Evil, I think you--

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Silence! I will not tolerate your 
                         insolence! Remember what happened 
                         last time.

               FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)

               Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.

               INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS

               Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         May I add, I appreciate you 
                         reinstating me after our little... 
                         misunderstanding.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?

               We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before.

                                     FRAU
                         Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How are things?

                                     FRAU
                         I have come to embrace the love that 
                         dare not speak it's name. To my right 
                         is my lover.

               We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous 
               eyebrow.

                                     FRAU
                         Her name is Unibrau. I met her on 
                         the LPGA Tour.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.

               Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy 
               milk mustache even larger.

                                     FRAU
                         Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (wiping it off, 
                              embarrassed)
                         Oh, I know. I know.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the 
                         Greek assassin, Oedipus.

               We see a swarthy Greek army guy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. 
                         Excited?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         I could give a shit.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Kiss your mother with that mouth?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         Yes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course you do.

               Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his 
               control panel, but Number Two interrupts.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing throat)
                         Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at 
                         which you liquidate henchmen far 
                         exceeds our ability to replace them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have so few pleasures left to me, 
                         Number Two. The key to life is to 
                         rotate your vices. One day it's 
                         executions, another day it's creamy 
                         French cheese.  It's like frickin' 
                         heroin.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the 
                         answer. While you were frozen, we 
                         began a program to clone you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Cool.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         We had a few glitches, but I think 
                         you'll be pleased with the results.

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Send in the clone!

               MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching 
               figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and 
               scarier.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         He is identical to you in every way, 
                         except he is one-eighth your size.

               We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL, 
               just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. 
               Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding 
               his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini-
                         Me.
                              (to clone)
                         Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.

               Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command 
               chair.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Mr. Bigglesworth!

               The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's 
               lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's 
               lap.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-me, something to eat?
                              (expectant pause)
                         No?
                              (pause)
                         OK.
                              (to room)
                         Tired.  Gentleman, I have a plan. As 
                         you know, the most powerful man in 
                         the world is the President of the 
                         United States. But he is just that- 
                         a man, subject to temptations of the 
                         flesh like any other man. Here's 
                         what we do: we make it seem that the 
                         President has had "extra-marital 
                         oral relations" with- and this is 
                         the kicker-

               DRAMATIC STING, SNAP ZOOM TO DR. EVIL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         With a White House intern!

               Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing his throat)
                         Uh-hem.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What, that already happened?

               Number Two nods.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, 
                         how about a frickin' time machine? 
                         Does the president have a time 
                         machine? Have I been scooped on that?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         No, not that I'm aware of.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, time machine it is. As you 
                         know, every diabolical scheme I've 
                         hatched has been thwarted by Austin 
                         Powers. And why is that, ladies and 
                         gentlemen?

                                     SCOTT
                         Because you never kill him when you 
                         get the chance and you're a dope?

               Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott 
               Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel.

               Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at Scott 
               and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Mojo?

                                     FRAU
                         Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, 
                         the essence, the libido, the "right 
                         stuff".

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's what the French call a certain 
                         'I don't know what.'

                                     SCOTT
                         If you've got a time machine, why 
                         don't you just go back and kill Austin 
                         Powers when he's a baby or something?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, no, no.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (interrupting)
                         Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to 
                         use your knowledge of the future to 
                         play the stock market? We could 
                         literally make trillions.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (smug laugh to himself)
                         Why make trillions when we could 
                         make...
                              (pause)
                         Billions?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Excuse me?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Why think small is all I'm saying.

                                     SCOTT
                         A trillion is more than a billion, 
                         numb-nuts.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Zip it. Unveil the time portal!

               A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of 
               shimmering energy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 
                         time portal. As you know, Austin 
                         Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, 
                         I time travel to 1969, two years 
                         after he was frozen. Security will 
                         be lax and I'll strike when he is 
                         totally helpless.

               First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination 
               of the world.

                                     SCOTT
                         Can I come?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Scott, Daddy has a score to 
                         settle. Austin Powers is the snake 
                         to my mongoose, or the mongoose to 
                         my snake. Either way it's bad, I 
                         don't know animals. But I do know 
                         this: This time it's personal. Frau, 
                         Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969. 
                         Come, Mini-Me.

               Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him 
               perfectly. They enter the portal.

               There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in 
               Star Trek.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR -

               Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal 
               into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room 
               dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A 
               younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in 
               an eye-patch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number 
                         Two, you look very youthful and 
                         healthy.
                              (turning to Frau)
                         And Frau you look...right.

               As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise 
               from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets 
               caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is 
               frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, people, we now officially have a 
                         chair problem. If another one of 
                         these chairs hits me in the nuts, 
                         I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want 
                         you to meet Number Two.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hello there.

               Mini-me says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me?

               Mini-me still says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shy. Low blood sugar.
                              (to room)
                         Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I 
                         have an operative inside the Ministry 
                         of Defense. By this time tomorrow, 
                         Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.

               Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND -

               We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of 
               a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the 
               side of a volcano on a tropical island.

                                     DR. EVIL (V.O.)
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM -

               We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it, 
               we see two digital clocks. One reads:

               CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN: 
               NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY 
               FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers).

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         We've had reports that there's a spy 
                         in the Ministry of Defense.  The 
                         contents of this room are vital to 
                         the country. Be on special alert.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                              (thick Scottish accent)
                         Those bastards will have to kill me 
                         before I let anything happen to this 
                         wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         Very good. And try and lose some 
                         weight for God's sake!

               They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                         Yessir!
                              (sotto after the 
                              Colonel)
                         I outta smash your teeth out with a

               The Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor 
               comes out of them, filling the room.

               The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious.

               He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech 
               syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places 
               it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green, 
               indicating FULL MOJO.

               EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY

               Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS 
               COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly 
               Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge 
               reads empty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's 
                         funny, I just filled the Shaguar up 
                         this morning.

               Austin hits a button on the dashboard.

               BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of 
                         British Intelligence.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You always are, Basil. Listen, the 
                         weirdest thing just happened, I've 
                         run out of petrol.

                         We'll send a man around immediately. 
                         How was your honeymoon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She 
                         was a Fembot!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Ah women, who can understand them? 
                         Moving on, let's discuss your new 
                         case.

                                     AUSTIN
                         New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         You'll be doing a photo shoot. We 
                         know that one of the models is an ex-
                         KGB agent selling top secret material 
                         to the highest bidder.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That sounds easy enough, you know 
                         what they say: all work and no 
                         shagging makes Austin a dull boy, 
                         man!

               INT. SKI LODGE

               Austin sets up his photo equipment. The room is decorated in 
               classic Heffner- bear skin rugs, leather chairs, roaring 
               fire.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Tres chic, baby.

               REG, the photo assistant, enters.

                                     REG
                         Austin, the models are ready.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ta, Reg. Bless your cotton socks. 
                         Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies?

                                     REG
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making 
                         models!

               The models make their entrance. They are REAL SUPERMODELS, 
               say CINDY CRAWFORD, REBECCA ROMAJIN and also one MODEL we 
               don't know.

                         Powers!

               Austin shoots a look to Reg like 'still got it, baby.'

                                     AUSTIN

                         Hi, I'm Cindy. I don't believe I've 
                         had the pleasure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course you haven't had "The 
                         Pleasure", we just met, baby, yeah!

                                     REBECCA
                         How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.

                         Your equipment is quite impressive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.

               Austin comes to the unknown model. She is tall and angular.

                                     AUSTIN
                         And what's your name, baby?

                         now is it?

               Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the 
               spy.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                              (inner monologue)
                         Now, which one is the Russian spy? 
                         Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin... 
                         or Ivana Humpalot? Think, man, think!

               Austin begins snapping pictures. The sequence is shot like a 
               photo shoot, with freeze frames, etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and 
                         pout for me baby! Smashing!

               Cindy gets on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great, darling. Give me some shoulder. 
                         Yes, yes, yes.

                         baby! You're a ring-tailed lemur.

               Rebecca looks confused.

               Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it.

                                     REG
                         Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot 
                         and I are going to have a 'private 
                         session'.

               Reg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana 
               are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He 
               CLAPS again and the fire goes up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I guessed wrong.

                                     IVANA
                         It takes a keen intelligence to play 
                         chess. Of course, you know what they 
                         say about men with big brains, don't 
                         you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         They wear large hats?

                                     IVANA
                         No, they make better lovers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wrong again.

               Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in 
               The Thomas Crowne Affair).

                                     IVANA
                         I assume you know how to play.

               She runs the bishop across her lips sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course.  The... horsey... moves 
                         in an L shape.

               Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let's stop playing games with each 
                         other... especially difficult ones. 
                         May I ask you a question, Miss 
                         Humpalot?

                                     IVANA
                         Of course.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny? Do I?

               Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug.

                                     IVANA
                         I'll tell you anything you want to 
                         know, just make love to me.

               She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair.

                                     IVANA
                         You are hairy, like an animal!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (growling and barking)
                         Grrrr, baby.

               Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf!
                              (covers the bear's 
                              eyes)
                         Wait a tick, I don't want him watching 
                         me while I'm on the job!

                                     IVANA
                         Make love to me, monkey man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy, baby!

               We pan around the room, seeing all the stuffed and mounted 
               wildlife who seem to be watching. Suddenly the camera stops. 
               So does the music.

                                     IVANA (O.S.)
                         What's the matter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A hot air balloon deflates and falls.  An actual scientific

                         Where is he? In here?

               INT. MOD - LAB

               Basil enters. Cross between a hospital room and a lab. Austin 
               lies in bed hooked up to lots of monitoring equipment.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, I came as soon as I heard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         There must be some kind of mistake, 
                         Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't 
                         know it.

               Austin holds his neck very stiffly.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's wrong with your neck, Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (turning stiffly to 
                              face Basil)
                         I took a Viagra and it got caught in 
                         my throat. I've had a stiff neck for 
                         hours. Basil, is it true? Have I 
                         lost my mojo?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We're going to run a few tests, 
                         Austin. Don't worry, old friend, 
                         we'll get to the bottom of this.

               INT. MRI MACHINE

               Austin is being loaded into one of those big scary MRI 
               machines: the MOJONATOR 9000. The mojo meter reads VERY LOW.

               INT. MOD LAB

               MONTAGE (TIME-LAPSE): Technicians in white suits and masks 
               transform the room into a love lair: A pair of Latex-gloved 
               hands carefully puts a BURT BACHARACH record on a turntable. 
               Examination lights are replaced with LAVA LAMPS. A tray is 
               brought in with a videotape marked "SWEDISH EDUCATIONAL FILM."

               Finally, the transformation is complete. Austin lies in bed 
               reading a vintage PLAYBOY. A CANDY STRIPE NURSE enters, very 
               pretty, in a tight outfit.

                                     NURSE
                         Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to 
                         give you a sponge bath before we 
                         begin the test.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (not paying attention 
                              to her)
                         Alright, miss, just let me finish 
                         this article on the Suez crisis.

               An ALARM goes off. Bright LIGHTS come on. Basil enters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         What's going on?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Alright, everyone, we're done.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But the test hasn't even started!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin. 
                         Not only were you actually reading 
                         an article in that Playboy, but a 
                         candy-stripe nurse offering to give 
                         you a sponge bath didn't so much as 
                         turn your head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I can explain, man! I was going 
                         to shag her but the article was so 
                         fascinating--

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's 
                         true: you've lost your mojo.

               Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (crushed)
                         Without my mojo, I'm useless to the 
                         Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think 
                         it's time to retire.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm afraid that's not possible, 
                         Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has 
                         returned.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Again?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Again.

               INT. MOD - TIME-TRAVEL ROOM

               Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the 
               largest room you've ever seen in your life.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We have evidence that Dr. Evil has 
                         developed a time machine.

               Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous 
               villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Our researcher noticed that these 
                         photos from the archives have changed. 
                         That means Dr. Evil is traveling 
                         back in time and creating alliances 
                         with each decade's most despised 
                         villains.

               Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't read in the car. I get a bit 
                         vomy.

               Austin burps and swallows it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Got it. I almost gipped.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.)
                         Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is 
                         in the year 1969. Luckily, we also 
                         have a time travel device. After 
                         years of research we've developed a 
                         machine that will transport you back 
                         to the Sixties.

               A bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new 
               VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by 
               Peter Max.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But Basil, isn't that the new 
                         Volkswagen Beetle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         That's what they'd like you to 
                         believe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 
                         and I was frozen in 1967, I could go 
                         look at my frozen self. But, if I'm 
                         still frozen in 1967, how could I 
                         have been unthawed in the 90's and 
                         traveled back to the Sixties?
                              (goes cross-eyed)
                         Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (to camera)
                         I suggest you don't worry about those 
                         things and just enjoy yourself.

               Austin gets into the car and turns it on.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This is smashing Basil. I'll go back 
                         to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, 
                         defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time 
                         for tea.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good luck, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.

               Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and 
               smashes some equipment.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.
                              (changing gears)
                         Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, 
                         yeah!

               The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, 
               leaving flaming tread marks.

               FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - LONDON -

               The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches 
               to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws 
               the hukka down. Austin hops out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I feel better already, man!

               Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being 
               TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.

               EXT. PARK - LONDON

               Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see 
               that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big 
               ARYAN ASSASSIN.

               PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 
               watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who 
               she is.

               A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of 
               all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. 
               The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!

               Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: 
               "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."

               Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number 
               begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet 
               Charity or Hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU 
                         CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE 
                         SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY 
                         JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

               Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES 
                         US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER
                         THAN THE SWORD

               Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM 
               SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU 
                         AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING 
                         IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET

               Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.  
                         WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'

               Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines 
               for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman 
               are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we 
               see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE 
               SYMBOL MEDALLION.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--
                         SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE
                         OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!

               Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms 
               outstretched.

               The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.

                                     EVERYONE
                              (chanting)
                         FREE-- LOVE!

                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (shouting)
                         IT'S THE SIXTIES!

               The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with 
               their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily 
               and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

               We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is 
               the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES 
               behind the binoculars hiding her face.

               37 EXT. CARNABY ST.

               Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

               Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

               The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

               The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

               The business man nods to a BOBBY.

               The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

               The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

               The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

               The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

               The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

               The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

               The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

               The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR 
               on a double-decker bus.

               The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

               The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.

               INT. CITROEN

               The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole 
               nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.

               EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES

               Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at 
               him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds 
               a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a 
               wall by hugging himself.

               The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his 
               gun.

               Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

               It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps 
               out.

               We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a 
               sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing 
               suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol 
               medallion.

               She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

               MUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME

                                     FELICITY
                         Care for a ride?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my Beetle, baby.

                                     FELICITY
                         It was your Beetle. Get in.

               Austin dives in as the assassin FIRES. The car speeds off.

               INT. BEETLE (REAR PROJECTION)

               Felicity drives expertly.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin Powers, I presume?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (turning to camera)
                         Crazy, baby!

               EXT. ROAD

               The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind 
               it.

               The assassin FIRES.

               INT. BEETLE

               Felicity turns around to look.

                                     FELICITY
                         Grab the wheel, would you?

               Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns 
               and FIRES out the window.

               EXT. ROAD

               The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and 
               he jumps out as it goes over.

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three 
               times before it EXPLODES.

               EXT. CLIFF

               The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls.

                                     ASSASSIN
                         Ahhhhhhhh!

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and 
               tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too, 
               EXPLODES.

                                     FELICITY
                         Well, Austin, I think this time you 
                         may have met your match.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and 
                         I'll beat him again.

                                     FELICITY
                         I was talking about me.

               She smiles, turns, and walks away.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD

               The room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing 
               illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an 
               elevator into the middle of the spotlight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Welcome to my shag pad, baby.

               Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi-
               fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin.

               Austin blows DUST off a table.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for something to drink?

               Austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a 
               wetbar.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or perhaps something to read?

               Austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a 
               button. It revolves to reveal a bookcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How about a hot cup of coffee?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, I rather fancy a grind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, Behave!

               Austin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a 
               cup.

               MUSIC: Girl from Impenema by JOBIM

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you like a... mas-sage? A 
                         sensssual mas-sage?

               Austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the 
               floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into 
               place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a 
               reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of 
               massage oils.

               Felicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How does that feel, baby?

                                     FELICITY
                         Mmm, lower.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (lowering his voice)
                         HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY?

               They laugh. Austin continues to massage her.

                                     FELICITY
                         Wait, something's itching me.

               She reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening 
               dress, revealing her naked back.

                                     FELICITY
                         That's better.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crikey!!!

               Austin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on 
               her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.

               Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (talking to his crotch)
                         Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do 
                         it for England.

               Austin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked.

                                     FELICITY
                         Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity 
                         stretches very sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you 'like to see my etchings?

                                     FELICITY
                              (sexy)
                         I think I'm ready for bed.

               She moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get you some PJs.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I'm ready for bed.

               She moves over to him. He avoids her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth 
                         then.

               Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally 
               grabs him and pins him to the bed.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I want to have sex with you, 
                         Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello Vicar!

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied everything about you- 
                         your methods, your accomplishments, 
                         your preferences. You're the reason 
                         I became a spy. Now, I've waited two 
                         years to meet you, so I say we get 
                         busy making up for lost time.

               Austin sits up.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (reflective)
                         Felicity, I used to think that way, 
                         too, but I guess... I guess I've 
                         changed.  Not to make a short story 
                         long, or to ramble on and on, or to 
                         keep talking in a repetitive manner 
                         ad infinitum until it becomes 
                         impossible to remember what I was 
                         talking about in the first place, 
                         but- where was I?

                         Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. 
                         I've lost my mojo.

                         Oh.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I thought coming back to the Sixties 
                         would bring it back, but it hasn't.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, don't worry. I know just the 
                         man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo 
                         recommended him and he's the best.

                                     AUSTIN

               It looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and

                         There he is. That's my guru.

               We see the GURU PITKA (played by Mike), an Indian man in a 
               bright red sari.

                                     FELICITY
                         Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin 
                         Powers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How are you baby?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My chakras are aligned and I am in a 
                         perfect state of equipoise.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Good on ya. I don't know what that 
                         means but it sounds fab.

                                     FELICITY
                         Guru, we need some advice.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Hold your horses and any other beasts-
                         of burden. I must lead my disciples 
                         in meditation and then I will help 
                         you.

               The Guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples 
               sink to their knees.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a 
                         spiritual teacher and I have combined 
                         many disparate disciplines into a 
                         unified movement of human potentiality 
                         and equipoise that I learned from my 
                         guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste 
                         man who died mysteriously of a disease 
                         that strangely had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis. He would say to me, 
                         Sparky, love is all, life is breath.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, perhaps you are wondering where 
                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called "Stinkmop". We would 
                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop 
                         into it, and play tag. I did not 
                         care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise 
                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, 
                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name 
                         kind of stuck.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist 
                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality. Now what is 
                         potentiality? It is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves. People often 
                         say to me that they feel "nowhere", 
                         and I am going to change that to 
                         "Now here."

               The guru holds up a card which says "NOWHERE = NOW HERE!"

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         And you have many assumptions about 
                         your goals, but when you "assume" 
                         You make an "ass" out of "u" and 
                         "me".

               Guru holds up a card which says "ASSUME = ASS - U - ME."

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh....

                                     GURU PITKA
                         The being, or that which we call 
                         'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It 
                         is not the taughts. It is the Gap 
                         between the tinker and the taughts! 
                         We are not our mind, we are not our 
                         body, we are the Gap!

               Guru holds up a card that says "NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT 
               THE GAP" with the familiar Gap font.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                              (rapid fire)
                         The heart of the matter is that you 
                         are the heart of the matter.  There 
                         is no "I" in "team". Beer before 
                         liquor, never sicker. Don't take a 
                         wooden nickel.  If your pipe is short 
                         and your pump is weak, you better 
                         stand close or you'll piss on your 
                         feet. He who goes to bed with itchy 
                         bum wakes up with smelly finger.

                         Ahhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Finally, the path to spiritual 
                         awakening requires the death of ego. 
                         Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the 
                         mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay 
                         Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

                              (chanting)
                         Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu 
                         Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

                         Go with God, and pay at the door 
                         please.

               The disciples file out. Austin and Felicity approach.

                         I'm not understanding.

                         Sorry?

                         Why are you beating around the bush?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my problem.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Ohhhhh, I get it.
                              (beat)
                         No, I don't get it.

                         Alright, easy.
                              (to Guru)
                         Felicity and I were all set for some 
                         hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for 
                         six.

                         Oh, yes, I see.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You have no idea what I'm saying, do 
                         you?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Not a word.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Guru, I've lost my mojo.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, mojo! You should have said so. 
                         Well, you've lost your mojo because 
                         your chakras are misaligned. You 
                         have lost love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?

                         Who's Vanessa?

                                     AUSTIN
                         She was an evil robot minion of Dr. 
                         Evil. I couldn't have loved her.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, 
                         buddy. You will only get your mojo 
                         back when you surround yourself with 
                         love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get what you're saying now! 
                         He's talking about free love, baby! 
                         Tune in, turn on, and drop out!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         I am talking about true love. You 
                         must stay and study until you are 
                         worthy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No way, man. The only way to surround 
                         yourself with love is to throw a 
                         swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!

                         I've got a lot of demons kickin' 
                         around in my noggin, but weight issues 
                         ain't one of them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, Fatty-

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the 
                         incorrect weight for my height and I 
                         was born out of wedlock, hence the 
                         moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not 
                         kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck 
                         that could choke a donkey.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, the mojo?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Where's my (bleeping) money?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         A gentlemen never discusses money.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' 
                         money and shove it up your (bleep), 
                         you stupid (bleeping) prick! While 
                         you're at it you can suck my greasy, 
                         two-toned (bleep)!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pause)
                         Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         (Bleep) you!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Bring in the money.

               Dr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded 
               with gold bars.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, here it is.

               Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of 
               MOJO.

               Dr. Evil is mesmerized.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, fetch.

               Mini-Me runs and snatches the mojo from Fat Bastard and gives 
               it to Dr. Evil, who caresses it and places it on a SPECIALLY 
               PREPARED PEDESTAL.

               NUMBER TWO enters.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin 
                         Powers is back in the Sixties. One 
                         of our best assassins spotted him 
                         but he got away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have 
                         his mojo.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         There is another. Felicity Shagwell, 
                         CIA.

               Suddenly, Scott Evil enters through TIME PORTAL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, what are you doing here?

                                     SCOTT
                         I don't know, I was sitting around 
                         watching the tube and The Courtship 
                         of Eddie's Father came on Nick at 
                         Nite, you know, and I was just 
                         listening to that theme song--
                              (hums/sings the theme)
                         Anyway it made me think that maybe 
                         we could try and work things out. 
                         You know, you are my Dad and I need 
                         you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You had your chance, Scott. I already 
                         have someone created in my image. 
                         He's evil, he wants to take over the 
                         world, and he fits easily into most 
                         overhead storage bins.
                              (looking around)
                         Has anyone seen Mini-Me?
                              (calling out)
                         Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver? 
                         Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put a 
                         frickin' bell on him or something?

               Scott, very hurt, sits back in his chair and sulks. Dr. Evil 
               hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, phase three. We place a 
                         giant laser on the moon. Let me 
                         demonstrate.
                              (beat)
                         Where's my laser?

               Dr. Evil looks around and sees Mini-Me gnawing on the model 
               laser. Dr. Evil takes it from his mouth

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, don't chew my laser.
                              (to room)
                         Not feeling well. He has an ear 
                         infection, but tit's OK.
                              (pause)
                         No? Nothing?
                              (back to model)
                         Anyway, the laser is powerful enough 
                         to destroy every city on the planet 
                         at will. We'll turn the moon into 
                         what I like to call a "Death Star".

               Scott SNICKERS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What?

                                     SCOTT
                              (snickering again)
                         Nothing Darth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What did you call me?

                                     SCOTT
                         Nothing.
                              (pretends to sneeze)
                         Rip-off!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unsure)
                         Bless you? Anyways, since my "death 
                         star" laser was invented by the noted 
                         Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I 
                         thought we'd name it in his honor-- 
                         the Alan Parsons Project.

               Scott SNICKERS again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What now?

                                     SCOTT
                         The Alan Parsons Project was a 
                         progressive rock band from 1982.  
                         Why don't you just name it Operation 
                         Wang Chung, ass?

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (indicating laser)
                         When you get your own evil empire, 
                         you can call it whatever you want.  
                         Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate 
                         the awesome lethality of the Alan 
                         Parsons Project. Fire the laser!

               INSERT SHOT:

               A giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White 
               House, causing it to explode.

               Everyone is shocked by the laser's power.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the 
                         Wihite House with no warning!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, that was just footage from 
                         the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture 
                         Independence Day, but it would be a 
                         lot like that. What do you think, 
                         Scott?

                                     SCOTT
                         Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was 
                         really impressive.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shhhh!

                                     SCOTT
                         I'm nineteen, I don't-

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh-
                         shh! It's Morse code.
                              (reading imaginary 
                              paper)
                         Let me decipher... it says 'shhhhh!'

                                     SCOTT
                         You are so lame-

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (like Electric Company)
                         Ssssss...huuuuuh...Shhhhh!

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, what are we going to do 
                         about Powers?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, in addition to being 
                         extremely rotund, you're a vicious 
                         killer.

               Take care of it.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It'll be my pleasure.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's an easy job. Without his mojo, 
                         Powers will be...powerless?

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

               A party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in 
               full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, 
                         baby, yeah!

               The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to 
               the music.

               Austin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and 
               smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from 
               her.

                                     PREGNANT WOMAN
                         Hey!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You'll thank me later, baby.

               Another angle. Austin and Felicity dancing.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (noticing someone)
                         Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?

               We see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair.

                                     RICARDO
                         Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen 
                         and the king laughed because he had 
                         too.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to camera)
                         Crazy, man!

                                     FELICITY
                         Let's split up and scope the scene.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at 
                         least not without me.

               Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to chick)
                         You're very exotic, baby. Do you 
                         have a little English in you?

                                     CHICK
                         No.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you like to?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy.

                                     ALAN ZEUS GUY
                              (rolling his eyes)
                         This is ridiculous!

                         No, but I bet it really hurts.

               Austin pops into frame with a book that says "AUSTIN POWERS

               The camera pans up Felicity's cool hip-huggers, which are

                         Those are skin tight. How do you get 
                         into those pants, baby?

                         Last night I had German-Chinese food. 
                         An hour later I was hungry- for power.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin takes his glasses off to clean them. We see his POV, 
               which is totally fuzzy. He looks over and sees what appears 
               to be a NUDE GIRL- two round globes and dark triangle.

               Austin puts his glasses on and looks again. It is actually a 
               girl in a flesh-colored dress. In between her and Austin 
               were two COMPLETELY BALD MEN and a triangular martini glass 
               filled with a Cosmopolitan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Look at that.

               She points to where Fat Bastard and his companion are 
               standing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not a pretty sight. Who is 
                         he?

                                     FELICITY
                         Until recently he worked security 
                         for the MOD, but we think he might 
                         be a double agent, possibly for Dr. 
                         Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How do you know?

                                     FELICITY
                         We've noticed that his lifestyle has 
                         changed dramatically. He's made a 
                         lot of cash purchases, he's hanging 
                         out with foxes half his age, and 
                         he's becomes quite a fixture on the 
                         London party circuit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who's the girl?

                                     FELICITY
                         I don't know, but it looks like he's 
                         splitting.

               Fat Bastard exits.

                                     FELICITY
                         I'll follow him. You see what you 
                         can get out of the girl. We'll 
                         rendezvous later.

               Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his 
               way over to the girl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, hello.

                         Robin. Robin Swallows.

                         Swallows? That's an interesting name. 
                         Are you English?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         German, actually. My maiden name is 
                         Spitz.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well which is it, baby, Spitz or 
                         Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         The pleasure is mine.

               She extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he 
               shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is 
               transfixed and keeps shaking far too long.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Charmed, I'm sure.
                              (still shaking, her 
                              breasts jiggle)
                         How do you do?
                              (still shaking, 
                              jiggling)
                         Yes, quite.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I always enjoy meeting new people.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         How's your mum? Good.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I love shaking hands.

               Austin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in 
               danger of popping out of her dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (snapping out of it)
                         So, who was your friend?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         His name is Fat Bastard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It suits him.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         He's my lover.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         OK. Would you happen to know if he's 
                         in business with a man named Mr. 
                         Evil?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin 
                         does a smug take.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Something to drink? Would you like a 
                         Mister Pepper?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper.

                         Really? I said Mister Pepper.

               Austin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls 
               him close.

               Literally a window in a wall. Fat Bastard is placing his

                         and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice.

               We pan to see Felicity beside him.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Can I ask you a question?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes.

                         Thank you.

               Beat.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Well, what's the question?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? 
                         Would you?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I'd love to, Mr. Powers, just come 
                         right... over... here.

               Robin moves Austin into place as they dance.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're a bit of alright.

               Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the REFLECTION 
               OF AN ASSASSIN (Oedipus) about to throw a knife.

               Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and 
               USES HER AS A SHIELD. She takes the knife squarely in the

                         Oedipus... use the revolver.

               Oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins FIRING. Austin continues 
               to use Robin AS A SHIELD. She takes six hits. Oedipus runs 
               out of bullets.

                         Oedipus... use the machine gun.

               Oedipus pulls out a machine gun and FIRES. In a Robert 
               Rodriquez- like flurry of events, Austin dodges while still 
               USING HER AS A SHIELD.

               Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin. Austin uses 
               Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum 
               pushes all three of them through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW of his 
               second story loft.

               IN MID-AIR

               As they fall, Austin turns Robin around so that she is between 
               him and the ground.

               EXT. OUTSIDE AUSTINIS FLAT

               They land with a THUD. Robin cushions Austin's fall. Oedipus 
               is dead on the pavement.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead 
                         as vaudeville.

                         You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has 
                         your mojo and it's only a matter of 
                         time before he kills you and takes 
                         over the world.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a 
               cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage.

               We pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD!

               He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I always get (bleep)in' hungry after 
                         I get my end away!

                                     FELICITY
                         I never would have thought that a 
                         man of such tremendous girth could 
                         be such a, um, creative and sensuous 
                         lover!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         You want some chicken? I have more!

               He rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS.

               Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around 
               for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage 
               and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to 
               go.

               ANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Frisky are we? Alright lets have 
                         another go!

               She is horrified.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Dr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Get me the President of the United 
                         States.

               The PRESIDENT appears on Dr. Evil's video screen with his 
               ADVISORS behind him.

               INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN)

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Dr. Evil, what do you want?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Not what I want Mr. President, but I 
                         will receive. In 12 hours I will 
                         destroy Washington, DC with a giant 
                         laser.

               Dr. Evil reveals a giant laser. Mini-Me is humping it like a 
               dog.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the 
                         laser get a frickin' room. Honestly.
                              (to President)
                         I will destroy another major city 
                         every hour- that is, unless you
                         pay me-

               The President and his advisors LAUGH.

                         Dr. Evil that's more than the entire 
                         federal budget for 1969.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't play games with me. The capitol 
                         will disappear if I don't receive

               His advisors LAUGH.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         That much money simply doesn't exist. 
                         I don't think l00 billion is even a 
                         number. It's like saying I want a 
                         kajillion bajillion dollars.

               His advisors LAUGH.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come on, Mr. President...

                         "Show me the money!"

               Dr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         What?

               He looks around again, expectantly.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I'm sorry, I don't understand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You know, kwan? Show me the money? 
                         No? Nothing?

                         It's 1969. That movie won't come out 
                         for another 30 years, ass.  They 
                         don't know what you're talking about.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. OK, see if you understand 
                         this: give me the money or I'm going 
                         to blow you to frickin' bits, OK?

               The President and his advisors MURMUR.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         But-

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (making 'stop' gesture)
                         Talk to the hand!

               Dr. Evil signs off.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (to Scott)
                         I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding 
                         Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech, 
                         very touching.

               Scott looks at him with disgust.

                                     DR.EVIL
                         Okay, everybody clear the room!

               Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his 
               logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A 
               SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!

               In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and 
               various magazine covers.

               He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the 
               ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup 
               of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of 
               glasses. He has become Austin Powers.

               Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic.
                              (beat)
                         This isn't working. I don't feel 
                         anything.

               We PUSH IN towards Dr. Evil's head.

               FLASH CUT TO:

               DR. EVIL ANIMATED SEQUENCE

               A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on 
               his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads 
               which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers 
               sprout the word "EVIL'.

               A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses 
               smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" 
               and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

               Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth 
               coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have 
               the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" 
               flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns 
               into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
               stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of 
               urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred 
               Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says 
               "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream 
               that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

               Pull back from Dr. Evil's head. He looks dazed and confused. 
               Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr. Evil 
               with all his Austin paraphernalia.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I was just... right. Would it kill 
                         you to frickin' knock?

               EXT./INT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin and Felicity walk along the street.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, tell me about the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You know I can't tell you details 
                         about the future, baby, it could 
                         alter history.

                                     FELICITY
                         Not details, just what it's like. 
                         You know, what's the scene?  Where's 
                         it at?

                                     AUSTIN
                         There've been a lot of advances in 
                         the Nineties, baby. The economy is 
                         stable, people take better care of 
                         their health concern for the 
                         environment is on the rise and, um, 
                         let's see, there's an entire 
                         television channel dedicated to golf.

                                     FELICITY
                         Sounds awful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's not so bad once you get used to 
                         it. The Nineties are about 
                         responsibility. You know, having 
                         respect for yourself and other people. 
                         I even got married.

                                     FELICITY
                         You? Married? What about the sexual 
                         revolution?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, it turns out there were some 
                         casualties, baby. Don't you think 
                         you'll ever get married?

                                     FELICITY
                         No, not until I get a little more 
                         'experience' under my belt.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand 
               to his mouth in fear.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wide-eyed)
                         Oh my God!

               Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.

                                     FELICITY
                              (looking around)
                         What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, written here on my hand, see?

               Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh 
               my God' on his hand with the pen.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Says 'Oh my God!'

               They laugh.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, look.

               Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an 
               instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.

               They run down the street filming each other.

               AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE

               This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film 
               from Austin and Felicity's POVs.

               There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of 
               frame like the MONKEES TV show.

               BACK ON THE STREET

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I haven't had this much 
                         fun since I worked undercover in 
                         Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.

                                     FELICITY
                         1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch 
                         cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from 
                         poisoning the world's water supply.

               Austin is impressed.

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied your file, Austin. I 
                         want to be a trailblazer, just like 
                         you.  The Seventies are right around 
                         the corner. It's going to be a 
                         glorious time for fashion and music 
                         and technology-- it won't be long 
                         before every flying car has its own 
                         8-track.

               Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.

                                     FELICITY
                         The CIA has always been a boy's club 
                         until now. Well move over, this 
                         chick's taking over.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Very impressive.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, your voice!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I think I'm coming down with 
                         something.

               Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his 
               pushcart.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get some ice cream. Would you 
                         like some?

                                     FELICITY
                         No thanks.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse, to ice cream 
                              man)
                         Could I have two scoops of Vanilla, 
                         please?

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Right away, governor. Would you like 
                         chocolate syrup?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes, please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Will you have any whipped cream?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         I will, thank you.

                                     ICE CR@ MAN
                         Candy sprinkles?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Crushed nuts?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, laryngitis.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Here's your change, sir. Oh, and 
                         Austin--

               We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a 
               very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another 
               actor before).

                                     AUSTIN
                              (now with phlegmy 
                              throat)
                         Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Hello, Austin. What's wrong with 
                         your voice?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (still phlegmy throat)
                         I just had ice cream. Listen to me, 
                         I have dairy throat.  "Mary had a 
                         little lamb and it was always 
                         gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar 
                         gate and kicked it's little-

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (Interrupting)
                         Austin! Things are heating up, so I 
                         thought it best to contact you in 
                         disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. 
                         You and Austin track Fat Bastard 
                         back to Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But how can we track Fat Bastard?

                                     FELICITY
                         I planted a homing device on him 
                         last night.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Yes, and we're starting to pick up 
                         the signal now.

               Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How did you get close enough to plant 
                         a homing device?

                                     FELICITY
                         I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.

               Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same 
               time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You... him? Just like that?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, Austin, we needed that 
                         information.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, 
                         we now know that-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         Did you use an elaborate set of 
                         pulleys? A block and tackle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Anyway, you two follow the signal 
                         back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and 
                         then-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         I just can't get my head around it, 
                         baby. You're so small and he's so 
                         ... not small. The sheer mechanics 
                         of it are mindboggling!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Never mind, Austin, you two have 
                         work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil.

               INT. BEETLE

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen built into the 
               dash.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got it! A Chinese basket with a 
                         counter-weighted ballast.  That's 
                         how you did it, right?

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, it almost sounds like you're 
                         jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who, me? That's not possible, baby!
                              (beat, to himself)
                         is it?

               Just then a-car pulls beside them. Two Dr. Evil Private Army 
               guys pull machine guns and start SHOOTING.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get down!

               Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS 
               from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD.

                                     FELICITY
                         We're obviously on the right track.
                              (re: tracking screen)
                         It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an 
                         island in the middle of the ocean.

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.

               EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT

               The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach. 
               We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.

               EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT

               Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the 
               Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain 
               through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.

                                     AUSTIN
                         According to the readings, Dr. Evil's 
                         headquarters is over the next ridge.

                                     FELICITY
                         Can I have a look?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is 
               still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.

                                     FELICITY
                         Question is, how do we get in?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (muffled)
                         Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, did you hear me?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I seem to be stuck in your dirty 
                         pillows.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where are the topographical maps 
                         that Basil drew up?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think they're in the tent.

               He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting 
               shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From 
               the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over 
               with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have 
               her hands up his butt.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Have you got it out yet?

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things 
                         do you put in there?

               The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage 
               links from his ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, anything that catches my fancy.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         How do you manage to fit it all in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, it stretches to fit.

               The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of 
               Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Are you almost done? I can't hold it 
                         much longer.

               INT. TENT

               We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent.

               Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent.

                                     FELICITY
                         Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing 
                         how much this duffel bag will hold.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on 
               top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (singing)
                         'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US?
                         JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'

               We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience. They 
               applaud.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I 
                         do have some bad news.  Powers' is 
                         on the island.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How tedious.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to 
                         him by using the girl.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I have the perfect weapon. Frau?

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Bring in the He-Bots!

               MUSIC: It's Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three HE-BOTS 
               enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type 
               outfits.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. 
                         What kind of woman could resist these 
                         perfect specimens of masculinity? 
                         Their clothes are stylish, their 
                         posture is ramrod straight, and their 
                         buttocks are tight, like tigers. 
                         And, each He-Bot is armed with a 
                         secret weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE FIRST HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours 
               out.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Poison gas...

               ANGLE ON THE SECOND HE-BOT.

               A gun barrel flips out form his crotch and FIRES machine-gun 
               style.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Machine gun...

               ANGLE ON THE THIRD HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles 
               out onto the floor, where it smokes.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         And deadly acid.

               Dr. Evil is disgusted by the last one.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. I object to the last one on 
                         aesthetic grounds, but I don't care 
                         how you get Powers, just bring him 
                         to me.

               EXT. TENT

               We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is 
               putting things into Austin's ass.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Do you want everything to go back 
                         in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat 
                         Bastard-

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         It's my job, Austin. You of all people 
                         should understand that.  Marakesh, 
                         1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I 
                         know your record backwards and 
                         forwards.  You've had more sex on 
                         the job than a Swedish stewardess.

               The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into 
               what appears to be Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         You're right, Felicity, I can't deny 
                         it. But the world changed, and I 
                         changed too.

               Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity 
               shoves the tennis racket extra hard.

               Austin stands up rapidly.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Ow!
                              (beat)
                         My back hurts.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Are you OK?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         I'm fine, just keeping packing.

               The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - 60'S

               Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Christ Almighty, it smells terrible 
                         in here.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's the volcanic sulphurous 
                         emissions. We've put up some air 
                         fresheners.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Great, now it smells like someone 
                         took a shite in a pine tree.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded 
                         into the rocket. You're ready for 
                         launch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. 
                         I have so few pleasures, you know.

               Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private 
               Army Men.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome 
                         to my hollowed-out volcano.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We meet again, Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you 
                         alive is so you can feel the agony 
                         of watching my plan unfold.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil your plan will never--

               Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind 
               Dr.  Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh, is that yours?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My mojo!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You know what they say: finders 
                         keepers, loser weepers.

                                     FELICITY
                         Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course. Why?

               Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls.

                                     FELICITY
                         Now you've got a couple of achers.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oww! My stomach hurts!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wincing)
                         I don't care if he is evil, you don't 
                         give a man a shot in the pills. It's 
                         just not cricket, baby.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Take them away.

               The guards lead Austin and Felicity away.

                                     SCOTT
                         She just hoofed you in the sack and 
                         you're going to leave them alone in 
                         a jail cell with one inept guard? 
                         They'll escape, dipshit. You do this 
                         every time!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You're going the right way for a 
                         smacked bottom, young man.

                                     SCOTT
                         You don't own me!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I do actually.
                              (pulling out paper)
                         It's complicated. Usually it's illegal 
                         but this buddy of mine... but I 
                         digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving 
                         you in charge. I'm going up the moon 
                         to hold the world ransom with my 
                         giant laser, I shouldn't be long.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         What about Powers?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         He's tucked away safely in his cell. 
                         He's harmless without that mojo. 
                         Guard it with your life.
                              (to Number Two)
                         Number Two, begin the countdown.

               The area around Dr. Evil's command chair, including the time 
               portal behind it, is enclosed by a circular door, becoming 
               part of the rocket. Steam begins billowing, etc.

                                     NUMBER TWO

               The rocket lifts off from the volcano into the night sky.

                         this.

               INT. JAIL CELL

               Austin and Felicity are in a bare cell with cement walls. 
               The huge metal door has a window with bars in it.

                                     FELICITY
                         How are we going to get out of here?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard 
                         again?

                                     FELICITY
                              (exploding)
                         Austin, that is it! I don't know 
                         what happened to you in the Nineties, 
                         but I'm still here, in the Sixties, 
                         and I still swing! Don't try to lay 
                         your hang-ups on me just because you 
                         lost your mojo! That one hurts.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.

                                     FELICITY
                         I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap 
                         shot.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, baby, you're right. I was wrong 
                         to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.

                                     FELICITY
                         But the Austin Powers I knew was 
                         wild and crazy and free. He could 
                         never be jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That Austin is gone. I've changed. I 
                         knew someone, not long ago, a very 
                         special woman. She taught me that 
                         life isn't about jumping into the 
                         sack with whoever comes along, it's 
                         about caring and responsibility. And 
                         while it is true she turned out to 
                         be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, 
                         I suppose I really did... love her.

                                     FELICITY
                         Was that your wife?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, Vanessa.

               Felicity is touched.

                                     FELICITY
                         Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to 
                         understand everything you've gone 
                         through, but I trust you. I'll make 
                         you a deal: if we get out of here 
                         alive, I'll give monogamy a try.

                                     AUSTIN
                         With me?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, silly.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy, baby!

               They kiss.

                                     FELICITY
                         We need to lure the guard inside and 
                         get his key.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, what if I pretend to be 
                         desperately ill with food poisoning? 
                         The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, 
                         will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, 
                         you dig a pit and line it with 
                         makeshift punji sticks made from 
                         sharpened toothbrushes. The guard 
                         falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've 
                         got the key.  What do you think?

                                     FELICITY
                         That might work, but how about this?

               Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping 
               open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. 
               We, however, can't see them.

                                     FELICITY
                              (giving a wolf whistle)
                         What do you think of these, my man?

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CELL

               The guard is mesmerized by Felicity.

                         Mommy...

               He unlocks the door and enters.

               INT. JAIL CELL

               The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin 
               is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce.

                                     FELICITY
                              (seductive, to guard)
                         It's very hot in here, don't you 
                         think?

               The guard follows her into the cell.

                                     FELICITY
                              (irritated)
                         It's very hot in here, don't you 
                         think?

               The guard advances on her.

                                     FELICITY
                              (breaking cover)
                         Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (from above)
                         I'm very firmly wedged.

                                     FELICITY
                         If you want something done...

               She PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Almost... got it!

               Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let's go get my mojo!

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE

               It is a stark, steel girder and glass structure. Dr. Evil is 
               trying to look dignified but he is FLOATING AWAY. He grabs 
               at the railing of his chair as his feet float up.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Has anyone seen my gravity booties? 
                         Honestly, all I wanted was a frickin' 
                         moon base. Hello, we're on the moon, 
                         no gravity?
                              (calling out)
                         Mini-Me? Are you alright?

               ANGLE ON THE TOP OF THE ROOM.

               Mini-Me is stuck to the top of the ceiling along with a lot 
               of DEBRIS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         My frickin' mascot is stuck to the 
                         ceiling, OK? Not good. Papa not happy.

               A couple of henchmen place BOOTS on Dr. Evil. He drops to 
               the floor.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (looking up)
                         Somebody get the stick. Hold on, 
                         Mini-Me.

                         Begin laser-

               He's interrupted by terrible FEEDBACK. Dr. Evil taps and 
               blows on the mic.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         (into microphone).
                         Begin-

               Worse FEEDBACK. He holds it farther away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (into mic)
                         Begin laser ignition sequence.

               The laser's coils begin to glow RED.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Austin and Felicity run into the Main Room. It is strangely 
               dark and quiet.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where's your mojo, Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm not sure.

               MUSIC: It's Raining Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Suddenly, the 
               lights dim. The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on 
               trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Watch out, baby, He-Bots!

               The He-Bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like 
               a perfect Olympic dismount. Their crotch nozzles flip up one 
               by one.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't fight them without my mojo.

                                     FELICITY
                         Who said anything about fighting?

               MUSIC: seductive music Felicity does a very seductive dance, 
               with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. The He-Bots EXPLODE, 
               succumbing to her mojo.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing, Felicity, you were making 
                         me very horny, man! Extremely randy, 
                         indeed!

                                     FAT BASTARD (O.S.)
                         C'mon, give the lads a show. Take of 
                         your top. Put 'em on the glass! Make 
                         'em bounce. Let's have a look at 
                         your tits.

               Austin and Felicity turn to see Fat Bastard lurking in the 
               background.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Looking for this, Mr. Powers?

               Fat Bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen 
               private army men.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I give the orders, (bleep) for brains. 
                         Guards, take them back to their cells.

               Guards approach.

                                     FELICITY
                         Hold on, let me ask you one question.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, I guess I owe you that much 
                         for a night of carnal ecstasy.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         What kind of stupid ass question is 
                         that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up 
                         to my tits in clean stinky.

                                     FELICITY
                         You didn't answer my question, are 
                         you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I 
                         could lose a few pounds, but I could 
                         shiva git!

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, 
                         I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger 
                         titties than you do! I've got more 
                         (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone 
                         book.  I've got more crack cheese 
                         than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay 
                         seen ma willie in two years. That's 
                         enough time to declare it legally 
                         deed! I can't stop eating. I eat 
                         because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy 
                         because I eat.

                         Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's 
                         a thin bastard, trying to get out

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Maybe there's big crap inside me 
                         trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough 
                         of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. 
                         Listen, I've run the gamut of self- 
                         help books.  "Food isn't love", right, 
                         but how do you get it from the page 
                         to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak, 
                         I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, 
                         take the mojo.

               Fat Bastard hands over the mojo.

                         I appreciate you trying to reach me, 
                         no one can do it for me, I know this 
                         now.  There's a hole in my soul that 
                         food won't fill. This is the beginning 
                         of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym 
                         everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's 
                         someone I have to get in touch with 
                         and forgive... myself.

                         we understand that America's first 
                         manned mission to the moon will be 
                         blasting off shortly.

               Pan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her 
               spacesuit, then CAMEO ASTRONAUT in his space suit. They are 
               surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters.

                         Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket 
                         scientist to figure this stuff out.

               A technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins.

                         We will have lift-off in T minus 10 
                         seconds... 9... 8... etc.

                         Felicity, if you get frightened, 
                         just hold my hand.

                         We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has 
                         cleared the tower and is heading for 
                         a rendezvous with the moon.

               INT. APOLLO CAPSULE

               The G-forces during lift-off are incredible. Austin's face 
               is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth. His 
               hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted.

               Austin is terrified. He clutches Felicity's hand, then grabs 
               on to the astronaut beside him.

               Felicity, however, loves it.

                         To be honest it was terrifying. It 
                         felt like sitting on top of a bomb. 
                         As I punched through the atmosphere, 
                         I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled

                         This is one small step for man, but 
                         a giant step for shagging.  Can you

               settling into his chair. It is like that shot in 2001 SPACE

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my 
                         rear!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Felicity runs ahead. Austin runs over to where the shadow 
               came from. He sees that it was not Dr. Evil, but MINI-ME, 
               carrying a little gun. Austin is ashamed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger. He's so small, 
                         he's like a dog or something.

               Austin chokes back a tear.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger.
                              (realizing)
                         Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is 
                         still alive! Felicity?

               Austin runs after her.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

               Austin rounds the corner and comes upon Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (holding his gun on 
                              Dr. Evil)
                         Alright, slap-head, turn around. 
                         Slowly.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Aren't you forgetting something?

               A wall panel in the main chamber revolves, revealing FELICITY, 
               enclosed in a glass tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!
                              (to Dr. Evil)
                         What have you done to her?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't worry, she's not dead... yet.

               Brightly colored GAS starts to fill the glass chamber.

                                     FELICITY
                              (muffled through glass)
                         Don't worry about me Austin. You've 
                         got to save the world!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice, 
                         Powers: save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

               Austin is torn. He looks back and forth between Felicity and 
               the laser which is on the other side of the room.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got my mojo back, man, I can do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We'll see. Fire the laser!

               The woman manning the laser's joystick begins to MOVE IT. 
               Austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hands off my joystick, baby.

               He wrestles with her a moment and then KNOCKS IT ASKEW.

               EXT. SPACE

               The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big 
               Boy's eyes cross in pain.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Damn you, Powers!

               Dr. Evil hits a SELF-DESTRUCT button. An ALARM blares.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Warning! Self-destruct sequence 
                         initiated!

               The base is rocked by EXPLOSIONS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Perhaps you spoke too soon.

               Austin looks over. Felicity has slumped over in the tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Noooooo!

               Austin BANGS on the glass with his fists.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake 
                         up! Please God, don't take her away.

               It is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and 
               gets away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, you have to understand, I 
                         thought I had my mojo back.  This 
                         isn't fair.

               Austin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick--

               FLASHBACK - MONTAGE

               of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first 
               kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self.

               A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against 
               the glass as if trying to reach her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love you, Felicity! I know I 
                         couldn't say it before, but I really 
                         do love you!
                              (enraged)
                         Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!

               Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block 
               his path. Austin is like an animal.

               He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and 
               takes a bite out of it.

               Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE 
               OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

               The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists 
               simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE 
               A PUMPKIN.

               Austin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for "75 BC". He runs 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC

               An orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel 
               with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You make love to your wife out of 
                         duty, your mistress for pleasure, 
                         and a Roman boy for ecstasy.
                              (noticing Austin)
                         Shit.

               He runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin 
               follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked "1975".

               EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD -

               Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting 
               into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO 
               with a white stripe pulls over.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I have to commandeer this vehicle.
                              (noticing)
                         Hey, aren't you Hutch?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

               We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY).

                                     PAUL MICHAEL GLASER
                         I'm Starsky.

                                     DAVID SOUL
                         I'm Hutch.

               Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car 
               disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino 
               follows.

               A sign at the car wash reads: "1911"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC -

               Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic" 
               stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with 
               Austin hot on his heels.

                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                         Iceberg, dead ahead!

               Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, 
               KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by.

                                     JAMES CAMERON
                         I'm king of the world!

               Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL 
               they just came from.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY -

               Dr. Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him. In 
               SLO-MO Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and TACKLES 
               Dr.  Evil, pinning him.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (breathing heavily)
                         Before you do that, know this: Austin, 
                         I am... your... father.

               MUSIC: DRAMATIC STING

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No. I can't back that up. I was just 
                         grasping at straws. I had nothing. 
                         But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers, 
                         you really have become a product of 
                         the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How so?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You're more interested in your job 
                         as glorified policeman than you are 
                         in love. You won the battle, but I 
                         won the war. Love means nothing, 
                         you've proved it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't think that Felicity was 
                         going to die, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What a cowardly response. I'm 
                         disappointed really. You have the 
                         power to go back in time and save 
                         her, but it means letting me go.

               Austin looks over and sees a TIME PORTAL. Through it he can 
               glimpse the lair, and Felicity.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going 
                         to be? Me or the girl?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!

               Austin runs through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - 60'S

               We see the scene from a moment ago. Felicity is in the glass 
               tube and the BRIGHTLY COLORED GAS is starting to fill it.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice: 
                         save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I choose love, baby.

               Austin runs over to the glass tube and SMASHES HIS FIST 
               through it. The glass SHATTERS and Austin pulls Felicity 
               out. She gasps for air.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I love you.

                                     FELICITY
                              (breathless)
                         But I thought-

                                     AUSTIN
                         That was another place and another 
                         time, baby.

               Austin kisses her for a long time. She starts to twitch.

               She struggles. She hits him in the head and he finally stops 
               kissing her.

                                     FELICITY
                              (gasping)
                         Can't. Breathe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry, baby, I got a little over- 
                         stimulated.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fire the laser!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What do we do?

                                     FELICITY
                         Use your mojo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         I don't have it!

                                     FELICITY
                         Trust me, you do!

               Austin turns and gives a 'who me?' look over his bottom. The 
               woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional 
               control just as it FIRES.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes 
               harmlessly by.

                         If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby!

               AUSTIN STUNT DOUBLE and an obvious FELICITY STUNT DOUBLE 
               emerge in their place.

               The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross 
               over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic 
               flips and stunts.

               The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed 
               pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place 
               and run through the TIME PORTAL. The TIME PORTAL reads "1999".

               Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other

                         warhead to the center of the earth 
                         and banished him into space forever.

                         PERHAPS NEXT TIME YOU SHOULD TRY 
                         FOREPLAY.

               Her machine gun breasts FIRE, spraying the room in SLO-MO.

               Then they run out of ammo and CLICK, CLICK.

               Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail. She 
               rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail. 
               Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.

               She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

               Fembot parts fly around the room. Austin sits on the bed, 
               saddened. He holds Vanessa's hand, which has wires hanging 
               out of it. On one of the fingers is her wedding ring.

               MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO

                                     AUSTIN
                              (very sad)
                         I can't believe Vanessa, my bride, 
                         my one true love, the woman who taught 
                         me the beauty of sharing your whole 
                         life with another, the person who 
                         taught me the meaning of love, was a 
                         Fembot. How will I ever go on?
                              (beat)
                         Wait a tic! That means I'm single! 
                         Oh, behave!

               INT. LOBBY - HOTEL

               Rich European guests mill about the luxurious lobby. Suddenly, 
               Austin dances through naked. Just as we are about to see his 
               bits and pieces, a man lifts up his suitcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yeah, baby, I'm free! I'm naked and 
                         free!

               SEQUENCE CREDIT

               MUSIC: Soul Bassanova by QUINCY JONES PAN UP Austin's NAKED 
               body as he walks down a boardwalk. Just as the camera reaches 
               that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears STARRING MIKE 
               MYERS. Austin gives a big 'who me?' and we

               FREEZE FRAME.

               EXT. BOARDWALK - FRENCH RIVERA

               European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind. 
               His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves 
               away. Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed-

               A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around 
               to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!' 
               take and we FREEZE FRAME.

               A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a 
               credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!

               Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns, 
               followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.

               A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude 
               Beach". Austin enters from the left.

               We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he 
               is about to appear from behind the sign, a...

               CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis 
               lengthwise as he walks.

               NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE

               A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her 
               bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be 
               suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.

               The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl. 
               The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit 
               "BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the 
               "PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.

               Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS 
               appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of 
               nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing 
               CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.

               A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are 
               blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.

               Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out 
               from his waist. Austin looks proud.

               A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier 
               weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND 
               MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.

               Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit 
               "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits 
               in mid-air:

               FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING" 
               AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."

               Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Shaguar, baby, yeah!

               CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar" 
               where it would normally read "Jaguar".

               The car speeds off.

               FULL SCREEN TV JERRY SPRINGER SHOW

               On the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son, 
               a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and SCOTT EVIL all seated on 
               a panel.

               Lower Third Chyron: "MY FATHER IS EVIL AND WANTS TO TAKE 
               OVER THE WORLD"  JERRY SPRINGER

               If you just joined us, today's topic is "my father is evil 
               and wants to take over the world". Now, Bobby, you had 
               something you wanted to share with your father before the 
               break.

                                     BOBBY
                         Dad, I know you're against race mixing 
                         and all that, but I met someone...

                                     KLANSMAN
                         Don't say it!

               The crowd WHOOPS.

                                     BOBBY
                         I met someone... and he's black.

               The crowd goes crazy.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         He?

               The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Please welcome Tim.

               A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the 
               Klansman's son. The crowd screams.

               JERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Now Scott, tell us about your father. 
                         Share with us.

                                     SCOTT
                         Well he's the head of an evil 
                         organization that has aspirations 
                         for world domination.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         And where is your father right now?

                                     SCOTT
                         He's in outer space, like frozen in 
                         a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big 
                         Boy rocket with his cat, Mr. 
                         Bigglesworth.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Really? Well, we have a surprise for 
                         you, Scott. Let's bring out

                                     SCOTT'S
                         father, Dr Evil.

               Dr Evil enters.

               Lower Third Chyron: "WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD"

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Hello Scott, I'm back.

                                     SCOTT
                         I can't believe you'd do this to me 
                         on national television!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         They offered me a free makeover.

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Dr. Evil, we've seen a lot of the 
                         fathers here today open up to their 
                         sons, sons to the fathers. Is there 
                         anything you'd like to share?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Share?

                                     JERRY SPRINGER
                         Yes, don't you have any secrets?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK. I have a vestigial tail.

               Everyone is a little grossed out.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's more of a nub, really. The spine 
                         just goes on a little longer than it 
                         should. Also, I've dabbled. I mean, 
                         perform fellatio once and you're a 
                         poet, twice and you're a homosexual. 
                         I remember once I was being fisted 
                         by Sebastian Cabot- but here's where 
                         the story gets interesting. He was 
                         lactose-intolerant. He could eat red 
                         meat all night long, but one sip of 
                         milk and it was gastric hell. And I 
                         remember we were caught in fragrance 
                         delicto by Henry Kissinger, and you 
                         can imagine my humiliation at having 
                         Hank hear me say, "Mr. French, no 
                         teeth." One of my greatest 
                         disappointments is that I never became 
                         a song and dance man. I could have 
                         been a quadruple threat, kind of 
                         like a despotic Ken Barry. Dancer, 
                         singer, actor, and I would possess 
                         nuclear weapons, the latter being 
                         the most threatening of the four. I 
                         once sat on a bus and tried to will 
                         myself a menstrual cycle. All I ended 
                         up with was a sense of failure and a 
                         mild neuralgia in my incisor teeth 
                         and perhaps a grudging respect for 
                         the weaker sex. I love toe cleavage. 
                         For the most part I distrust dogs. I 
                         slept in a horse once. It was quite 
                         roomy. On second thought, it was the 
                         Ritz. I named my left testicle 'piss' 
                         and my right testicle 'vinegar'. I 
                         wrote "It's Raining Men", or so the 
                         Christmas babies told me. Oh yes, I 
                         also made a Marzipan voodoo effigy 
                         of The Fonze while I was in coma 
                         after smoking some Peruvian prayer 
                         hash, but who at the end of the day 
                         can honestly say they haven't done 
                         that?

               The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once 
               quiet.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         What are you, some kind of freak?

                                     SCOTT
                         Shut up, jagoff!

               Studio audience whoops at this.

                                     KLANSMAN
                         I'll kick your ass punk!

               Crowd goes crazy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No one talks to my boy that way!

               Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.  
               Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm OK, I'm OK.

               There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking 
               him down.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Scott, let's go to daddy's new 
                         evil lair.

               EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY

               We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the 
               top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and 
               the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.

               INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM

               The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks 
               paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans, 
               and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is 
               a Starbucks.

               Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and 
               lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW 
               HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot 
               coffee products.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, as the legitimate frontman 
                         of your organization, I seized upon 
                         the opportunity to invest in a small 
                         Seattle-based coffee company several 
                         years ago. Today, Starbucks is a far-
                         flung empire with 2000 outlets 
                         worldwide.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh good, Number Two, I do enjoy a 
                         good cuppa joe.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         If I may continue, I believe if we 
                         shift our resources away from world 
                         domination and focus on providing 
                         premium quality coffee drinks, we 
                         can increase our gross profits 
                         fivefold.

               Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY 
               MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Perhaps you've confused me 
                         with someone who gives a shit.  Might 
                         I remind you that I run the show 
                         here? I demand a little respect.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (indicating Dr. Evil's 
                              milk mustache)
                         Dr. Evil, I think you--

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Silence! I will not tolerate your 
                         insolence! Remember what happened 
                         last time.

               FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)

               Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.

               INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS

               Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         May I add, I appreciate you 
                         reinstating me after our little... 
                         misunderstanding.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen?

               We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before.

                                     FRAU
                         Zehr gut, Herr Doctor.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How are things?

                                     FRAU
                         I have come to embrace the love that 
                         dare not speak it's name. To my right 
                         is my lover.

               We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous 
               eyebrow.

                                     FRAU
                         Her name is Unibrau. I met her on 
                         the LPGA Tour.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right on. Welcome, Unibrau.

               Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy 
               milk mustache even larger.

                                     FRAU
                         Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.'

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (wiping it off, 
                              embarrassed)
                         Oh, I know. I know.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the 
                         Greek assassin, Oedipus.

               We see a swarthy Greek army guy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. 
                         Excited?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         I could give a shit.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Kiss your mother with that mouth?

                                     OEDIPUS
                         Yes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course you do.

               Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his 
               control panel, but Number Two interrupts.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing throat)
                         Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at 
                         which you liquidate henchmen far 
                         exceeds our ability to replace them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I have so few pleasures left to me, 
                         Number Two. The key to life is to 
                         rotate your vices. One day it's 
                         executions, another day it's creamy 
                         French cheese.  It's like frickin' 
                         heroin.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the 
                         answer. While you were frozen, we 
                         began a program to clone you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Cool.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         We had a few glitches, but I think 
                         you'll be pleased with the results.

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Send in the clone!

               MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching 
               figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and 
               scarier.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         He is identical to you in every way, 
                         except he is one-eighth your size.

               We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL, 
               just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. 
               Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding 
               his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini-
                         Me.
                              (to clone)
                         Mini-Me, you will sit to my right.

               Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command 
               chair.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come Mr. Bigglesworth!

               The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's 
               lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's 
               lap.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-me, something to eat?
                              (expectant pause)
                         No?
                              (pause)
                         OK.
                              (to room)
                         Tired.  Gentleman, I have a plan. As 
                         you know, the most powerful man in 
                         the world is the President of the 
                         United States. But he is just that- 
                         a man, subject to temptations of the 
                         flesh like any other man. Here's 
                         what we do: we make it seem that the 
                         President has had "extra-marital 
                         oral relations" with- and this is 
                         the kicker-

               DRAMATIC STING, SNAP ZOOM TO DR. EVIL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         With a White House intern!

               Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (clearing his throat)
                         Uh-hem.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What, that already happened?

               Number Two nods.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous. Oh well, 
                         how about a frickin' time machine? 
                         Does the president have a time 
                         machine? Have I been scooped on that?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         No, not that I'm aware of.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, time machine it is. As you 
                         know, every diabolical scheme I've 
                         hatched has been thwarted by Austin 
                         Powers. And why is that, ladies and 
                         gentlemen?

                                     SCOTT
                         Because you never kill him when you 
                         get the chance and you're a dope?

               Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott 
               Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel.

               Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at Scott 
               and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, because Austin Powers has "mojo".

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Mojo?

                                     FRAU
                         Yes, mojo. The mojo is the life force, 
                         the essence, the libido, the "right 
                         stuff".

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's what the French call a certain 
                         'I don't know what.'

                                     SCOTT
                         If you've got a time machine, why 
                         don't you just go back and kill Austin 
                         Powers when he's a baby or something?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, no, no.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                              (interrupting)
                         Dr. Evil, wouldn't it be easier to 
                         use your knowledge of the future to 
                         play the stock market? We could 
                         literally make trillions.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (smug laugh to himself)
                         Why make trillions when we could 
                         make...
                              (pause)
                         Billions?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Excuse me?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Why think small is all I'm saying.

                                     SCOTT
                         A trillion is more than a billion, 
                         numb-nuts.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Zip it. Unveil the time portal!

               A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of 
               shimmering energy.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the 
                         time portal. As you know, Austin 
                         Powers was frozen in 1967. Therefore, 
                         I time travel to 1969, two years 
                         after he was frozen. Security will 
                         be lax and I'll strike when he is 
                         totally helpless.

               First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination 
               of the world.

                                     SCOTT
                         Can I come?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No, Scott, Daddy has a score to 
                         settle. Austin Powers is the snake 
                         to my mongoose, or the mongoose to 
                         my snake. Either way it's bad, I 
                         don't know animals. But I do know 
                         this: This time it's personal. Frau, 
                         Number 2, I'll see you both in 1969. 
                         Come, Mini-Me.

               Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him 
               perfectly. They enter the portal.

               There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in 
               Star Trek.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR -

               Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal 
               into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room 
               dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A 
               younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in 
               an eye-patch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, here we are Mini-Me, 1969. Number 
                         Two, you look very youthful and 
                         healthy.
                              (turning to Frau)
                         And Frau you look...right.

               As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise 
               from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets 
               caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is 
               frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, people, we now officially have a 
                         chair problem. If another one of 
                         these chairs hits me in the nuts, 
                         I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want 
                         you to meet Number Two.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Hello there.

               Mini-me says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me?

               Mini-me still says nothing.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shy. Low blood sugar.
                              (to room)
                         Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I 
                         have an operative inside the Ministry 
                         of Defense. By this time tomorrow, 
                         Austin Powers' mojo will be mine.

               Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (maniacal laugh)
                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND -

               We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of 
               a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the 
               side of a volcano on a tropical island.

                                     DR. EVIL (V.O.)

                         Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!

               INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM -

               We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it, 
               we see two digital clocks. One reads:

               CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN: 
               NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY 
               FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers).

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         We've had reports that there's a spy 
                         in the Ministry of Defense.  The 
                         contents of this room are vital to 
                         the country. Be on special alert.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                              (thick Scottish accent)
                         Those bastards will have to kill me 
                         before I let anything happen to this 
                         wee naked hairy popsicle, sir!

                                     BRITISH COLONEL
                         Very good. And try and lose some 
                         weight for God's sake!

               They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits.

                                     FAT SOLDIER
                         Yessir!
                              (sotto after the 
                              Colonel)
                         I outta smash your teeth out with a

                         Scottish-Independence!

               The Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor 
               comes out of them, filling the room.

               The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious.

               He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech 
               syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places 
               it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green, 
               indicating FULL MOJO.

               EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY

               Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS 
               COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly 
               Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge 
               reads empty.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's 
                         funny, I just filled the Shaguar up 
                         this morning.

               Austin hits a button on the dashboard.

               BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (on picture phone)
                         Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of 
                         British Intelligence.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You always are, Basil. Listen, the 
                         weirdest thing just happened, I've 
                         run out of petrol.

                         We'll send a man around immediately. 
                         How was your honeymoon?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She 
                         was a Fembot!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Ah women, who can understand them? 
                         Moving on, let's discuss your new 
                         case.

                                     AUSTIN
                         New case? Very shagadelic, Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         You'll be doing a photo shoot. We 
                         know that one of the models is an ex-
                         KGB agent selling top secret material 
                         to the highest bidder.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That sounds easy enough, you know 
                         what they say: all work and no 
                         shagging makes Austin a dull boy, 
                         man!

               INT. SKI LODGE

               Austin sets up his photo equipment. The room is decorated in 
               classic Heffner- bear skin rugs, leather chairs, roaring 
               fire.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (looking around)
                         Tres chic, baby.

               REG, the photo assistant, enters.

                                     REG
                         Austin, the models are ready.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ta, Reg. Bless your cotton socks. 
                         Hey, Reg, do you have any hobbies?

                                     REG
                         What?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hobbies, man! I for one enjoy making 
                         models!

               The models make their entrance. They are REAL SUPERMODELS, 
               say CINDY CRAWFORD, REBECCA ROMAJIN and also one MODEL we 
               don't know.

                         Powers!

               Austin shoots a look to Reg like 'still got it, baby.'

                                     AUSTIN
                         One at a time, girls. One. At. A.

                         Hi, I'm Cindy. I don't believe I've 
                         had the pleasure.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course you haven't had "The 
                         Pleasure", we just met, baby, yeah!

                                     REBECCA
                         How do you do, Austin? I'm Rebecca.

                         Your equipment is quite impressive.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you. Your breasts are amazing.

               Austin comes to the unknown model. She is tall and angular.

                                     AUSTIN
                         And what's your name, baby?

                         now is it?

               Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the 
               spy.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                              (inner monologue)
                         Now, which one is the Russian spy? 
                         Cindy Crawford, Rebecca Romajin... 
                         or Ivana Humpalot? Think, man, think!

               Austin begins snapping pictures. The sequence is shot like a 
               photo shoot, with freeze frames, etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, baby! Love it. Turn and 
                         pout for me baby! Smashing!

               Cindy gets on all fours.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Great, darling. Give me some shoulder. 
                         Yes, yes, yes.

                         baby, be frosted. Now be a lemur, 
                         baby! You're a ring-tailed lemur.

               Rebecca looks confused.

                         A lemur?

                         this!
                              (imitating lemur)
                         OK, predator coming! Now, burrow,

                         you've got.
                              (beat)
                         I take it back. Be a tiger again.

                         And... done! I'm spent!

               Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it.

                                     REG
                         Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot 
                         and I are going to have a 'private 
                         session'.

               Reg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana 
               are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He 
               CLAPS again and the fire goes up.

                         I once had a bad experience with

                         into a brandy snifter.

               Ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby.

                         It takes a keen intelligence to play 
                         chess. Of course, you know what they 
                         say about men with big brains, don't 
                         you?

                                     AUSTIN
                         They wear large hats?

                                     IVANA
                         No, they make better lovers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wrong again.

               Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in 
               The Thomas Crowne Affair).

                                     IVANA
                         I assume you know how to play.

               She runs the bishop across her lips sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Of course.  The... horsey... moves 
                         in an L shape.

               Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let's stop playing games with each 
                         other... especially difficult ones. 
                         May I ask you a question, Miss 
                         Humpalot?

                                     IVANA
                         Of course.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Do I make you horny? Do I?

               Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug.

                                     IVANA
                         I'll tell you anything you want to 
                         know, just make love to me.

               She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair.

                                     IVANA
                         You are hairy, like an animal!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (growling and barking)
                         Grrrr, baby.

               Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf!
                              (covers the bear's 
                              eyes)
                         Wait a tick, I don't want him watching 
                         me while I'm on the job!

                                     IVANA
                         Make love to me, monkey man.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy, baby!

               We pan around the room, seeing all the stuffed and mounted 
               wildlife who seem to be watching. Suddenly the camera stops. 
               So does the music.

                                     IVANA (O.S.)
                         What's the matter?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A hot air balloon deflates and falls.  An actual scientific

                         Where is he? In here?

               INT. MOD - LAB

               Basil enters. Cross between a hospital room and a lab. Austin 
               lies in bed hooked up to lots of monitoring equipment.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Austin, I came as soon as I heard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         There must be some kind of mistake, 
                         Basil. Maybe I was drunk and I didn't 
                         know it.

               Austin holds his neck very stiffly.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         What's wrong with your neck, Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (turning stiffly to 
                              face Basil)
                         I took a Viagra and it got caught in 
                         my throat. I've had a stiff neck for 
                         hours. Basil, is it true? Have I 
                         lost my mojo?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We're going to run a few tests, 
                         Austin. Don't worry, old friend, 
                         we'll get to the bottom of this.

               INT. MRI MACHINE

               Austin is being loaded into one of those big scary MRI 
               machines: the MOJONATOR 9000. The mojo meter reads VERY LOW.

               INT. MOD LAB

               MONTAGE (TIME-LAPSE): Technicians in white suits and masks 
               transform the room into a love lair: A pair of Latex-gloved 
               hands carefully puts a BURT BACHARACH record on a turntable. 
               Examination lights are replaced with LAVA LAMPS. A tray is 
               brought in with a videotape marked "SWEDISH EDUCATIONAL FILM."

               Finally, the transformation is complete. Austin lies in bed 
               reading a vintage PLAYBOY. A CANDY STRIPE NURSE enters, very 
               pretty, in a tight outfit.

                                     NURSE
                         Excuse me, Mr. Powers, I need to 
                         give you a sponge bath before we 
                         begin the test.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (not paying attention 
                              to her)
                         Alright, miss, just let me finish 
                         this article on the Suez crisis.

               An ALARM goes off. Bright LIGHTS come on. Basil enters.

                                     AUSTIN
                         What's going on?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Alright, everyone, we're done.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But the test hasn't even started!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Agent Haggerty was the test, Austin. 
                         Not only were you actually reading 
                         an article in that Playboy, but a 
                         candy-stripe nurse offering to give 
                         you a sponge bath didn't so much as 
                         turn your head.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Wait, I can explain, man! I was going 
                         to shag her but the article was so 
                         fascinating--

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm sorry, Austin, I'm afraid it's 
                         true: you've lost your mojo.

               Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (crushed)
                         Without my mojo, I'm useless to the 
                         Ministry and to Her Majesty.  I think 
                         it's time to retire.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         I'm afraid that's not possible, 
                         Austin. You see, Dr. Evil has 
                         returned.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Again?

                         Again.

               INT. MOD - TIME-TRAVEL ROOM

               Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the 
               largest room you've ever seen in your life.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         We have evidence that Dr. Evil has 
                         developed a time machine.

               Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous 
               villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Our researcher noticed that these 
                         photos from the archives have changed. 
                         That means Dr. Evil is traveling 
                         back in time and creating alliances 
                         with each decade's most despised 
                         villains.

               Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't read in the car. I get a bit 
                         vomy.

               Austin burps and swallows it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Got it. I almost gipped.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION (V.O.)
                         Our data indicates that Dr. Evil is 
                         in the year 1969. Luckily, we also 
                         have a time travel device. After 
                         years of research we've developed a 
                         machine that will transport you back 
                         to the Sixties.

               A bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new 
               VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by 
               Peter Max.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But Basil, isn't that the new 
                         Volkswagen Beetle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         That's what they'd like you to 
                         believe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         So, Basil, if I travel back to 1969 
                         and I was frozen in 1967, I could go 
                         look at my frozen self. But, if I'm 
                         still frozen in 1967, how could I 
                         have been unthawed in the 90's and 
                         traveled back to the Sixties?
                              (goes cross-eyed)
                         Oh, no, I've gone cross-eyed.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (to camera)
                         I suggest you don't worry about those 
                         things and just enjoy yourself.

               Austin gets into the car and turns it on.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This is smashing Basil. I'll go back 
                         to the Sixties, recharge my mojo, 
                         defeat Dr. Evil and be back in time 
                         for tea.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Good luck, Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Luck has nothing to do with it, Basil.

               Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and 
               smashes some equipment.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.
                              (changing gears)
                         Swinging Sixties, here I come, baby, 
                         yeah!

               The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS, 
               leaving flaming tread marks.

               FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - LONDON -

               The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches 
               to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws 
               the hukka down. Austin hops out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I feel better already, man!

               Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being 
               TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.

               EXT. PARK - LONDON

               Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see 
               that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big 
               ARYAN ASSASSIN.

               PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN 
               watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who 
               she is.

               A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of 
               all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND. 
               The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."

                         Alright, baby, a swinging shin-dig!

               Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of 
               the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage 
               and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song: 
               "SEXUAL REVOLUTION."

               Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number 
               begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet 
               Charity or Hair.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         'THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, YOU 
                         CAN FEEL IT IN THE AIR.  PEOPLE 
                         SHAGGING JUST LIKE WEASELS AND THEY 
                         JUST DON'T SEEM TO CARE.

               Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY, WATCH OUT SQUARES...  YOU MAKES 
                         US BORED!  THE PENIS IS MIGHTIER
                         THAN THE SWORD

               Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM 
               SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         THERE'S A SEXUAL REVOLUTION AND YOU 
                         AIN'T SEEN NOTHING YET PEOPLE SHAGGING 
                         IN THE CLUBS AND INSIDE A JUMBO JET

               Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         HEY SQUARE WORLD THE END IS NIGH.  
                         WHEN WE SAY HUMP YOU SAY 'HOW HIGH?'

               Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines 
               for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman 
               are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we 
               see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE 
               SYMBOL MEDALLION.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (singing)
                         SO GO MAKE LOVE OR MASTURBATE--
                         SEXUAL FREEDOM WILL NEVER BE
                         OUT OF DAAAAAAAAAAATE!

               Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms 
               outstretched.

               The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.

                                     EVERYONE
                              (chanting)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (louder)
                         FREE-- LOVE!
                              (shouting)
                         IT'S THE SIXTIES!

               The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with 
               their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily 
               and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

               We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is 
               the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES 
               behind the binoculars hiding her face.

               37 EXT. CARNABY ST.

               Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

               Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

               The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

               The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

               The business man nods to a BOBBY.

               The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

               The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

               The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

               The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

               The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

               The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

               The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

               The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR 
               on a double-decker bus.

               The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

               The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.

               INT. CITROEN

               The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole 
               nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.

               EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES

               Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at 
               him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds 
               a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a 
               wall by hugging himself.

               The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his 
               gun.

               Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

               It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps 
               out.

               We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a 
               sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing 
               suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol 
               medallion.

               She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

               MUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME

                                     FELICITY
                         Care for a ride?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my Beetle, baby.

                                     FELICITY
                         It was your Beetle. Get in.

               Austin dives in as the assassin FIRES. The car speeds off.

               INT. BEETLE (REAR PROJECTION)

               Felicity drives expertly.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin Powers, I presume?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (turning to camera)
                         Crazy, baby!

               EXT. ROAD

               The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind 
               it.

               The assassin FIRES.

               INT. BEETLE

               Felicity turns around to look.

                                     FELICITY
                         Grab the wheel, would you?

               Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns 
               and FIRES out the window.

               EXT. ROAD

               The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and 
               he jumps out as it goes over.

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three 
               times before it EXPLODES.

               EXT. CLIFF

               The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls.

                                     ASSASSIN
                         Ahhhhhhhh!

               EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

               Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and 
               tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too, 
               EXPLODES.

                                     FELICITY
                         Well, Austin, I think this time you 
                         may have met your match.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I've beaten Dr. Evil before, and 
                         I'll beat him again.

                                     FELICITY
                         I was talking about me.

               She smiles, turns, and walks away.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD

               The room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing 
               illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an 
               elevator into the middle of the spotlight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Welcome to my shag pad, baby.

               Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi-
               fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin.

               Austin blows DUST off a table.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Care for something to drink?

               Austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a 
               wetbar.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Or perhaps something to read?

               Austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a 
               button. It revolves to reveal a bookcase.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How about a hot cup of coffee?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, I rather fancy a grind.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, Behave!

               Austin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a 
               cup.

               MUSIC: Girl from Impenema by JOBIM

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you like a... mas-sage? A 
                         sensssual mas-sage?

               Austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the 
               floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into 
               place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a 
               reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of 
               massage oils.

               Felicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How does that feel, baby?

                                     FELICITY
                         Mmm, lower.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (lowering his voice)
                         HOW DOES THAT FEEL, BABY?

               They laugh. Austin continues to massage her.

                                     FELICITY
                         Wait, something's itching me.

               She reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening 
               dress, revealing her naked back.

                                     FELICITY
                         That's better.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Crikey!!!

               Austin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on 
               her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry.

               Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (talking to his crotch)
                         Hello, anyone home? C'mon lads, do 
                         it for England.

               Austin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked.

                                     FELICITY
                         Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity 
                         stretches very sexily.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you 'like to see my etchings?

                         I think I'm ready for bed.

               She moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of 
               the bed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get you some PJs.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I'm ready for bed.

               She moves over to him. He avoids her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth 
                         then.

               Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally 
               grabs him and pins him to the bed.

                                     FELICITY
                         No, I want to have sex with you, 
                         Austin.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello Vicar!

                         I've studied everything about you- 
                         your methods, your accomplishments, 
                         your preferences. You're the reason 
                         I became a spy. Now, I've waited two 
                         years to meet you, so I say we get 
                         busy making up for lost time.

               Austin sits up.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (reflective)
                         Felicity, I used to think that way, 
                         too, but I guess... I guess I've 
                         changed.  Not to make a short story 
                         long, or to ramble on and on, or to 
                         keep talking in a repetitive manner 
                         ad infinitum until it becomes 
                         impossible to remember what I was 
                         talking about in the first place,

                                     FELICITY
                              (obviously disappointed)
                         Oh.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I thought coming back to the Sixties 
                         would bring it back, but it hasn't.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, don't worry. I know just the 
                         man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo 
                         recommended him and he's the best.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby!

               It looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and 
               DISCIPLES.  Austin and Felicity enter.

                         There he is. That's my guru.

               We see the GURU PITKA (played by Mike), an Indian man in a 
               bright red sari.

                                     FELICITY
                         Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin 
                         Powers.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How are you baby?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My chakras are aligned and I am in a 
                         perfect state of equipoise.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Good on ya. I don't know what that 
                         means but it sounds fab.

                                     FELICITY
                         Guru, we need some advice.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Hold your horses and any other beasts-
                         of burden. I must lead my disciples 
                         in meditation and then I will help 
                         you.

               The Guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples 
               sink to their knees.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         My name is the Guru Pitka. I am a 
                         spiritual teacher and I have combined 
                         many disparate disciplines into a 
                         unified movement of human potentiality 
                         and equipoise that I learned from my 
                         guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste 
                         man who died mysteriously of a disease 
                         that strangely had all the hallmarks 
                         of syphilis. He would say to me, 
                         Sparky, love is all, life is breath.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhh!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, perhaps you are wondering where 
                         I got the nickname Sparky.  Well, 
                         when we were young we used to play a 
                         game called "Stinkmop". We would 
                         urinate into a bucket, dip a mop 
                         into it, and play tag. I did not 
                         care for "Stinkmop" and a very wise 
                         old man said to me 'oh lighten up, 
                         Sparky', and I don't know, the name 
                         kind of stuck.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Now, the reason I am a spiritualist 
                         instead of a therapist is that 
                         'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' 
                         and that will not help us attain 
                         potentiality. Now what is 
                         potentiality? It is the ability to 
                         achieve those goals that we wish to 
                         achieve for ourselves. People often 
                         say to me that they feel "nowhere", 
                         and I am going to change that to 
                         "Now here."

               The guru holds up a card which says "NOWHERE = NOW HERE!"

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         And you have many assumptions about 
                         your goals, but when you "assume" 
                         You make an "ass" out of "u" and 
                         "me".

               Guru holds up a card which says "ASSUME = ASS - U - ME."

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhhhh....

                                     GURU PITKA
                         The being, or that which we call 
                         'ourselves', is not the tinker.  It 
                         is not the taughts. It is the Gap 
                         between the tinker and the taughts! 
                         We are not our mind, we are not our 
                         body, we are the Gap!

               Guru holds up a card that says "NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT 
               THE GAP" with the familiar Gap font.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                              (rapid fire)
                         The heart of the matter is that you 
                         are the heart of the matter.  There 
                         is no "I" in "team". Beer before 
                         liquor, never sicker. Don't take a 
                         wooden nickel.  If your pipe is short 
                         and your pump is weak, you better 
                         stand close or you'll piss on your 
                         feet. He who goes to bed with itchy 
                         bum wakes up with smelly finger.

                                     DISCIPLES
                         Ahhhhh...

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Finally, the path to spiritual 
                         awakening requires the death of ego. 
                         Leggo of my ego! Let us end with the 
                         mantra: Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay 
                         Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

                                     DISCIPLES
                              (chanting)
                         Om Ay Vant Yu Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu 
                         Uh... Mo Ay Vant Yu Hu.

               The Guru takes a swig of Yoo-Hoo.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Go with God, and pay at the door 
                         please.

               The disciples file out. Austin and Felicity approach.

                         Guru, I'm having trouble performing.

                         You know- my bits and pieces are a 
                         bit sleepy.

                         I'm not understanding.

                         I've forgotten the steps to the Mummy-

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Still not clear.

                         My flag's at half mast and no one

                         Sorry?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My Willie don't work.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Why are you beating around the bush?

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's my problem.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Ohhhhh, I get it.
                              (beat)
                         No, I don't get it.

                         Alright, easy.
                              (to Guru)
                         Felicity and I were all set for some 
                         hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for 
                         six.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, yes, I see.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You have no idea what I'm saying, do 
                         you?

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Not a word.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Guru, I've lost my mojo.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Oh, mojo! You should have said so. 
                         Well, you've lost your mojo because 
                         your chakras are misaligned. You 
                         have lost love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa?

                         Who's Vanessa?

                                     AUSTIN
                         She was an evil robot minion of Dr. 
                         Evil. I couldn't have loved her.

                                     GURU PITKA
                         Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, 
                         buddy. You will only get your mojo 
                         back when you surround yourself with 
                         love.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, I get what you're saying now! 
                         He's talking about free love, baby! 
                         Tune in, turn on, and drop out!

                                     GURU PITKA
                         I am talking about true love. You 
                         must stay and study until you are 
                         worthy.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No way, man. The only way to surround 
                         yourself with love is to throw a 
                         swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah!

               INT. DR.EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               Dr. Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as

                         ain't one of them.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Alright, Fatty-

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the 
                         incorrect weight for my height and I 
                         was born out of wedlock, hence the 
                         moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not 
                         kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck 
                         that could choke a donkey.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, the mojo?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Where's my (bleeping) money?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         A gentlemen never discusses money.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' 
                         money and shove it up your (bleep), 
                         you stupid (bleeping) prick! While 
                         you're at it you can suck my greasy, 
                         two-toned (bleep)!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (pause)
                         Vulgarity is no substitute for wit.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         (Bleep) you!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. Bring in the money.

               Dr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded 
               with gold bars.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, here it is.

               Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of 
               MOJO.

               Dr. Evil is mesmerized.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, fetch.

               Mini-Me runs and snatches the mojo from Fat Bastard and gives 
               it to Dr. Evil, who caresses it and places it on a SPECIALLY 
               PREPARED PEDESTAL.

               NUMBER TWO enters.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, I have some bad news. Austin 
                         Powers is back in the Sixties. One 
                         of our best assassins spotted him 
                         but he got away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         This is ri-goddamn-diculous, we have 
                         his mojo.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         There is another. Felicity Shagwell, 
                         CIA.

               Suddenly, Scott Evil enters through TIME PORTAL.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Scott, what are you doing here?

                                     SCOTT
                         I don't know, I was sitting around 
                         watching the tube and The Courtship 
                         of Eddie's Father came on Nick at 
                         Nite, you know, and I was just 
                         listening to that theme song--
                              (hums/sings the theme)
                         Anyway it made me think that maybe 
                         we could try and work things out. 
                         You know, you are my Dad and I need 
                         you.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You had your chance, Scott. I already 
                         have someone created in my image. 
                         He's evil, he wants to take over the 
                         world, and he fits easily into most 
                         overhead storage bins.
                              (looking around)
                         Has anyone seen Mini-Me?
                              (calling out)
                         Mini-Me! Mini-Mouse? Mini-Driver? 
                         Hello! Mini Pearl? Can we put a 
                         frickin' bell on him or something?

               Scott, very hurt, sits back in his chair and sulks. Dr. Evil 
               hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Gentlemen, phase three. We place a 
                         giant laser on the moon. Let me 
                         demonstrate.
                              (beat)
                         Where's my laser?

               Dr. Evil looks around and sees Mini-Me gnawing on the model 
               laser. Dr. Evil takes it from his mouth

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Mini-Me, don't chew my laser.
                              (to room)
                         Not feeling well. He has an ear 
                         infection, but tit's OK.
                              (pause)
                         No? Nothing?
                              (back to model)
                         Anyway, the laser is powerful enough 
                         to destroy every city on the planet 
                         at will. We'll turn the moon into 
                         what I like to call a "Death Star".

               Scott SNICKERS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What?

                                     SCOTT
                              (snickering again)
                         Nothing Darth.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What did you call me?

                                     SCOTT
                         Nothing.
                              (pretends to sneeze)
                         Rip-off!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (unsure)
                         Bless you? Anyways, since my "death 
                         star" laser was invented by the noted 
                         Cambridge physicist, Dr. Parsons. I 
                         thought we'd name it in his honor-- 
                         the Alan Parsons Project.

               Scott SNICKERS again.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What now?

                                     SCOTT
                         The Alan Parsons Project was a 
                         progressive rock band from 1982.  
                         Why don't you just name it Operation 
                         Wang Chung, ass?

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (indicating laser)
                         When you get your own evil empire, 
                         you can call it whatever you want.  
                         Gentlemen, allow me to demonstrate 
                         the awesome lethality of the Alan 
                         Parsons Project. Fire the laser!

               INSERT SHOT:

               A giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White 
               House, causing it to explode.

               Everyone is shocked by the laser's power.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         My God, Dr. Evil, you destroyed the 
                         Wihite House with no warning!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Actually, that was just footage from 
                         the 1996 blockbuster motion Picture 
                         Independence Day, but it would be a 
                         lot like that. What do you think, 
                         Scott?

                                     SCOTT
                         Yeah, Codename: Thompson Twins was 
                         really impressive.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shhhh!

                                     SCOTT
                         I'm nineteen, I don't-

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Shh! Shh-Shh. Shh-Shhhhhh-Shh. Shh-
                         shh! It's Morse code.
                              (reading imaginary 
                              paper)
                         Let me decipher... it says 'shhhhh!'

                                     SCOTT
                         You are so lame-

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (like Electric Company)
                         Ssssss...huuuuuh...Shhhhh!

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, what are we going to do 
                         about Powers?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fat Bastard, in addition to being 
                         extremely rotund, you're a vicious 
                         killer.

               Take care of it.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It'll be my pleasure.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's an easy job. Without his mojo, 
                         Powers will be...powerless?

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

               A party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in 
               full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage.

                                     AUSTIN
                         This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, 
                         baby, yeah!

               The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to 
               the music.

               Austin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and 
               smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from 
               her.

                                     PREGNANT WOMAN
                         Hey!

                                     AUSTIN
                         You'll thank me later, baby.

               Another angle. Austin and Felicity dancing.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (noticing someone)
                         Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you?

               We see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair.

                                     RICARDO
                         Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen 
                         and the king laughed because he had 
                         too.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to camera)
                         Crazy, man!

                                     FELICITY
                         Let's split up and scope the scene.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at 
                         least not without me.

               Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (to chick)
                         You're very exotic, baby. Do you 
                         have a little English in you?

                                     CHICK
                         No.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Would you like to?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy.

                                     ALAN ZEUS GUY
                              (rolling his eyes)
                         This is ridiculous!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A LONDON COP and Felicity are on hanging chairs.

                         Have you ever been picked up by the

                         No, but I bet it really hurts.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A GUY IN A RAINCOAT on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides 
               through the party and falls over.

               Austin pops into frame with a book that says "AUSTIN POWERS

               The camera pans up Felicity's cool hip-huggers, which are 
               very tight.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Those are skin tight. How do you get 
                         into those pants, baby?

                         drink.

               Austin does a spit take.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Austin is wearing a silly spiked German helmet like in Hogan's 
               Heroes.

                         Hello, I am Baron Von Firstinbed. 
                         Last night I had German-Chinese food. 
                         An hour later I was hungry- for power.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Yeah, I heard she broke it off.

               Austin takes his glasses off to clean them. We see his POV, 
               which is totally fuzzy. He looks over and sees what appears 
               to be a NUDE GIRL- two round globes and dark triangle.

               Austin puts his glasses on and looks again. It is actually a 
               girl in a flesh-colored dress. In between her and Austin 
               were two COMPLETELY BALD MEN and a triangular martini glass 
               filled with a Cosmopolitan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Look at that.

               She points to where Fat Bastard and his companion are 
               standing.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That's not a pretty sight. Who is 
                         he?

                                     FELICITY
                         Until recently he worked security 
                         for the MOD, but we think he might 
                         be a double agent, possibly for Dr. 
                         Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How do you know?

                                     FELICITY
                         We've noticed that his lifestyle has 
                         changed dramatically. He's made a 
                         lot of cash purchases, he's hanging 
                         out with foxes half his age, and 
                         he's becomes quite a fixture on the 
                         London party circuit.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who's the girl?

                                     FELICITY
                         I don't know, but it looks like he's 
                         splitting.

               Fat Bastard exits.

                                     FELICITY
                         I'll follow him. You see what you 
                         can get out of the girl. We'll 
                         rendezvous later.

               Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his 
               way over to the girl.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hello, hello.

                         Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party.

                         Who are you today, baby?

                         Robin. Robin Swallows.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Swallows? That's an interesting name. 
                         Are you English?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         German, actually. My maiden name is 
                         Spitz.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well which is it, baby, Spitz or 
                         Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         The pleasure is mine.

               She extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he 
               shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is 
               transfixed and keeps shaking far too long.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Charmed, I'm sure.
                              (still shaking, her 
                              breasts jiggle)
                         How do you do?
                              (still shaking, 
                              jiggling)
                         Yes, quite.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I always enjoy meeting new people.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         How's your mum? Good.
                              (shakes, jiggles)
                         I love shaking hands.

               Austin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in 
               danger of popping out of her dress.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (snapping out of it)
                         So, who was your friend?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         His name is Fat Bastard.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It suits him.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         He's my lover.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     AUSTIN
                         OK. Would you happen to know if he's 
                         in business with a man named Mr. 
                         Evil?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin 
                         does a smug take.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Something to drink? Would you like a 
                         Mister Pepper?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really? I said Mister Pepper.

               Austin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls 
               him close.

               Literally a window in a wall. Fat Bastard is placing his

                         bangers and mash, 3 orders of fish 
                         and chips, and... a Fresca. No ice.

               We pan to see Felicity beside him.

               Felicity swallows hard and forces a smile.

               INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

                                     AUSTIN
                         Can I ask you a question?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Yes.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Thank you.

               Beat.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         Well, what's the question?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, yes. Would you like to shag? 
                         Would you?

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS
                         I'd love to, Mr. Powers, just come 
                         right... over... here.

               Robin moves Austin into place as they dance.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You're a bit of alright.

               Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the REFLECTION 
               OF AN ASSASSIN (Oedipus) about to throw a knife.

               Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and 
               USES HER AS A SHIELD. She takes the knife squarely in the 
               back.

                                     ROBIN SWALLOWS

                         Oedipus... use the revolver.

               Oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins FIRING. Austin continues 
               to use Robin AS A SHIELD. She takes six hits. Oedipus runs 
               out of bullets.

                         Oedipus... use the machine gun.

               Oedipus pulls out a machine gun and FIRES. In a Robert 
               Rodriquez- like flurry of events, Austin dodges while still 
               USING HER AS A SHIELD.

               Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin. Austin uses 
               Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum 
               pushes all three of them through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW of his 
               second story loft.

               IN MID-AIR

               As they fall, Austin turns Robin around so that she is between 
               him and the ground.

               EXT. OUTSIDE AUSTINIS FLAT

               They land with a THUD. Robin cushions Austin's fall. Oedipus 
               is dead on the pavement.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry baby, too late. He's as dead 
                         as vaudeville.

                         You can't win, Powers. Dr. Evil has 
                         your mojo and it's only a matter of 
                         time before he kills you and takes 
                         over the world.

               INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a 
               cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage.

               We pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD!

               He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I always get (bleep)in' hungry after 
                         I get my end away!

                                     FELICITY
                         I never would have thought that a 
                         man of such tremendous girth could 
                         be such a, um, creative and sensuous 
                         lover!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         You want some chicken? I have more!

               He rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS.

               Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around 
               for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage 
               and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to 
               go.

               ANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Frisky are we? Alright lets have 
                         another go!

               She is horrified.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Dr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Get me the President of the United 
                         States.

               The PRESIDENT appears on Dr. Evil's video screen with his 
               ADVISORS behind him.

               INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN)

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Dr. Evil, what do you want?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Not what I want Mr. President, but I 
                         will receive. In 12 hours I will 
                         destroy Washington, DC with a giant 
                         laser.

               Dr. Evil reveals a giant laser. Mini-Me is humping it like a 
               dog.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the 
                         laser get a frickin' room. Honestly.
                              (to President)
                         I will destroy another major city 
                         every hour- that is, unless you
                         pay me-

               The President and his advisors LAUGH.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Dr. Evil that's more than the entire 
                         federal budget for 1969.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't play games with me. The capitol 
                         will disappear if I don't receive

               His advisors LAUGH.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         That much money simply doesn't exist. 
                         I don't think l00 billion is even a 
                         number. It's like saying I want a 
                         kajillion bajillion dollars.

               His advisors LAUGH.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Come on, Mr. President...

                         "Show me the money!"

               Dr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         What?

                         "Show me the money!"

               He looks around again, expectantly.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         I'm sorry, I don't understand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You know, kwan? Show me the money? 
                         No? Nothing?

                                     SCOTT
                         It's 1969. That movie won't come out 
                         for another 30 years, ass.  They 
                         don't know what you're talking about.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. OK, see if you understand 
                         this: give me the money or I'm going 
                         to blow you to frickin' bits, OK?

               The President and his advisors MURMUR.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         But-

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (making 'stop' gesture)
                         Talk to the hand!

               Dr. Evil signs off.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (to Scott)
                         I did love that, though. Cuba Gooding 
                         Jr. was outstanding. Oscar speech, 
                         very touching.

               Scott looks at him with disgust.

                                     DR.EVIL
                         Okay, everybody clear the room!

               Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his 
               logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A 
               SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!

               In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and 
               various magazine covers.

               He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the 
               ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup 
               of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of 
               glasses. He has become Austin Powers.

               Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yeah, baby. Very shagedelic.
                              (beat)
                         This isn't working. I don't feel 
                         anything.

               We PUSH IN towards Dr. Evil's head.

               FLASH CUT TO:

               DR. EVIL ANIMATED SEQUENCE

               A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on 
               his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads 
               which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers 
               sprout the word "EVIL'.

               A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses 
               smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE" 
               and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

               Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth 
               coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have 
               the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE" 
               flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns 
               into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-
               stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of 
               urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred 
               Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says 
               "LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream 
               that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

               Pull back from Dr. Evil's head. He looks dazed and confused. 
               Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr. Evil 
               with all his Austin paraphernalia.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, one last thing. I-- oh.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I was just... right. Would it kill 
                         you to frickin' knock?

               EXT./INT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

               Austin and Felicity walk along the street.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, tell me about the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You know I can't tell you details 
                         about the future, baby, it could 
                         alter history.

                                     FELICITY
                         Not details, just what it's like. 
                         You know, what's the scene?  Where's 
                         it at?

                                     AUSTIN
                         There've been a lot of advances in 
                         the Nineties, baby. The economy is 
                         stable, people take better care of 
                         their health concern for the 
                         environment is on the rise and, um, 
                         let's see, there's an entire 
                         television channel dedicated to golf.

                                     FELICITY
                         Sounds awful.

                                     AUSTIN
                         It's not so bad once you get used to 
                         it. The Nineties are about 
                         responsibility. You know, having 
                         respect for yourself and other people. 
                         I even got married.

                                     FELICITY
                         You? Married? What about the sexual 
                         revolution?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Well, it turns out there were some 
                         casualties, baby. Don't you think 
                         you'll ever get married?

                                     FELICITY
                         No, not until I get a little more 
                         'experience' under my belt.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand 
               to his mouth in fear.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wide-eyed)
                         Oh my God!

               Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.

                                     FELICITY
                              (looking around)
                         What is it! Is it Fat Bastard?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, written here on my hand, see?

               Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh 
               my God' on his hand with the pen.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Says 'Oh my God!'

               They laugh.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, look.

               Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an 
               instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.

               They run down the street filming each other.

               This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film 
               from Austin and Felicity's POVs.

               There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of 
               frame like the MONKEES TV show.

               BACK ON THE STREET

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I haven't had this much 
                         fun since I worked undercover in 
                         Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was.

                                     FELICITY
                         1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch 
                         cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from 
                         poisoning the world's water supply.

               Austin is impressed.

                                     FELICITY
                         I've studied your file, Austin. I 
                         want to be a trailblazer, just like 
                         you.  The Seventies are right around 
                         the corner. It's going to be a 
                         glorious time for fashion and music 
                         and technology-- it won't be long 
                         before every flying car has its own 
                         8-track.

               Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.

                                     FELICITY
                         The CIA has always been a boy's club 
                         until now. Well move over, this 
                         chick's taking over.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Very impressive.

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, your voice!

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, I think I'm coming down with 
                         something.

               Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his 
               pushcart.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'll get some ice cream. Would you 
                         like some?

                                     FELICITY
                         No thanks.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse, to ice cream 
                              man)
                         Could I have two scoops of Vanilla, 
                         please?

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Right away, governor. Would you like 
                         chocolate syrup?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes, please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Will you have any whipped cream?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         I will, thank you.

                                     ICE CR@ MAN
                         Candy sprinkles?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (hoarse)
                         Yes please.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Crushed nuts?

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, laryngitis.

                                     ICE CREAM MAN
                         Here's your change, sir. Oh, and 
                         Austin--

               We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a 
               very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another 
               actor before).

                                     AUSTIN
                              (now with phlegmy 
                              throat)
                         Basil!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Hello, Austin. What's wrong with 
                         your voice?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (still phlegmy throat)
                         I just had ice cream. Listen to me, 
                         I have dairy throat.  "Mary had a 
                         little lamb and it was always 
                         gruntin'. She tied it to a five bar 
                         gate and kicked it's little-

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                              (Interrupting)
                         Austin! Things are heating up, so I 
                         thought it best to contact you in 
                         disguise. Felicity, your plan worked. 
                         You and Austin track Fat Bastard 
                         back to Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                         But how can we track Fat Bastard?

                                     FELICITY
                         I planted a homing device on him 
                         last night.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Yes, and we're starting to pick up 
                         the signal now.

               Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How did you get close enough to plant 
                         a homing device?

                                     FELICITY
                         I shagged him, I shagged him rotten.

               Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same 
               time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         You... him? Just like that?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, Austin, we needed that 
                         information.

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Well, thanks to your effort, Felicity, 
                         we now know that-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         Did you use an elaborate set of 
                         pulleys? A block and tackle?

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Anyway, you two follow the signal 
                         back to Dr. Evil's headquarters and 
                         then-

                                     AUSTIN
                              (interrupting, to 
                              Felicity)
                         I just can't get my head around it, 
                         baby. You're so small and he's so 
                         ... not small. The sheer mechanics 
                         of it are mindboggling!

                                     BASIL EXPOSITION
                         Never mind, Austin, you two have 
                         work to do. You must find Dr.  Evil.

               INT. BEETLE

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen built into the 
               dash.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I got it! A Chinese basket with a 
                         counter-weighted ballast.  That's 
                         how you did it, right?

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, it almost sounds like you're 
                         jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Who, me? That's not possible, baby!
                              (beat, to himself)
                         is it?

               Just then a-car pulls beside them. Two Dr. Evil Private Army 
               guys pull machine guns and start SHOOTING.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Get down!

               Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS 
               from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD.

                                     FELICITY
                         We're obviously on the right track.
                              (re: tracking screen)
                         It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an 
                         island in the middle of the ocean.

               EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT

               We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.

               EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT

               The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach. 
               We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.

               EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT

               Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the 
               Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain 
               through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.

                                     AUSTIN
                         According to the readings, Dr. Evil's 
                         headquarters is over the next ridge.

                                     FELICITY
                         Can I have a look?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sure.

               Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is 
               still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.

                                     FELICITY
                         Question is, how do we get in?

                                     AUSTIN
                              (muffled)
                         Mmmmmmm...mmmmm...

                                     FELICITY
                         Austin, did you hear me?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I seem to be stuck in your dirty 
                         pillows.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where are the topographical maps 
                         that Basil drew up?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I think they're in the tent.

               He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting 
               shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From 
               the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over 
               with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have 
               her hands up his butt.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Have you got it out yet?

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things 
                         do you put in there?

               The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage 
               links from his ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, anything that catches my fancy.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         How do you manage to fit it all in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Oh, it stretches to fit.

               The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of 
               Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Are you almost done? I can't hold it 
                         much longer.

               INT. TENT

               We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent.

               Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent.

                                     FELICITY
                         Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing 
                         how much this duffel bag will hold.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

               We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on 
               top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (singing)
                         'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US?
                         JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?'

               We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience. They 
               applaud.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, that was fantastic, but I 
                         do have some bad news.  Powers' is 
                         on the island.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         How tedious.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Don't worry, Dr. Evil, we can get to 
                         him by using the girl.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Really?

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         I have the perfect weapon. Frau?

                                     FRAU
                              (shouting)
                         Bring in the He-Bots!

               MUSIC: It's Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three HE-BOTS 
               enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type 
               outfits.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, may I present the He-Bots. 
                         What kind of woman could resist these 
                         perfect specimens of masculinity? 
                         Their clothes are stylish, their 
                         posture is ramrod straight, and their 
                         buttocks are tight, like tigers. 
                         And, each He-Bot is armed with a 
                         secret weapon.

               ANGLE ON THE FIRST HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours 
               out.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Poison gas...

               ANGLE ON THE SECOND HE-BOT.

               A gun barrel flips out form his crotch and FIRES machine-gun 
               style.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         Machine gun...

               ANGLE ON THE THIRD HE-BOT.

               A nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles 
               out onto the floor, where it smokes.

                                     NUMBER TWO (O.S.)
                         And deadly acid.

               Dr. Evil is disgusted by the last one.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Right. I object to the last one on 
                         aesthetic grounds, but I don't care 
                         how you get Powers, just bring him 
                         to me.

               EXT. TENT

               We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is 
               putting things into Austin's ass.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Do you want everything to go back 
                         in?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Yes. Listen, Felicity, about Fat 
                         Bastard-

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         It's my job, Austin. You of all people 
                         should understand that.  Marakesh, 
                         1962. Rome, 1964. Tokyo, 1966. I 
                         know your record backwards and 
                         forwards.  You've had more sex on 
                         the job than a Swedish stewardess.

               The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into 
               what appears to be Austin's ass.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         You're right, Felicity, I can't deny 
                         it. But the world changed, and I 
                         changed too.

               Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity 
               shoves the tennis racket extra hard.

               Austin stands up rapidly.

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         Ow!
                              (beat)
                         My back hurts.

                                     FELICITY (V.O.)
                         Are you OK?

                                     AUSTIN (V.O.)
                         I'm fine, just keeping packing.

               The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - 60'S

               Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Christ Almighty, it smells terrible 
                         in here.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It's the volcanic sulphurous 
                         emissions. We've put up some air 
                         fresheners.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Great, now it smells like someone 
                         took a shite in a pine tree.

                                     NUMBER TWO
                         Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded 
                         into the rocket. You're ready for 
                         launch.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. 
                         I have so few pleasures, you know.

               Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private 
               Army Men.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome 
                         to my hollowed-out volcano.

                                     AUSTIN
                         We meet again, Dr. Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you 
                         alive is so you can feel the agony 
                         of watching my plan unfold.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Dr. Evil your plan will never--

               Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind 
               Dr.  Evil.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oh, is that yours?

                                     AUSTIN
                         My mojo!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You know what they say: finders 
                         keepers, loser weepers.

                                     FELICITY
                         Dr. Evil, do you like real estate?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Of course. Why?

               Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls.

                                     FELICITY
                         Now you've got a couple of achers.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Oww! My stomach hurts!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (wincing)
                         I don't care if he is evil, you don't 
                         give a man a shot in the pills. It's 
                         just not cricket, baby.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Take them away.

               The guards lead Austin and Felicity away.

                                     SCOTT
                         She just hoofed you in the sack and 
                         you're going to leave them alone in 
                         a jail cell with one inept guard? 
                         They'll escape, dipshit. You do this 
                         every time!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You're going the right way for a 
                         smacked bottom, young man.

                                     SCOTT
                         You don't own me!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         I do actually.
                              (pulling out paper)
                         It's complicated. Usually it's illegal 
                         but this buddy of mine... but I 
                         digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving 
                         you in charge. I'm going up the moon 
                         to hold the world ransom with my 
                         giant laser, I shouldn't be long.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         What about Powers?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         He's tucked away safely in his cell. 
                         He's harmless without that mojo. 
                         Guard it with your life.
                              (to Number Two)
                         Number Two, begin the countdown.

               The area around Dr. Evil's command chair, including the time 
               portal behind it, is enclosed by a circular door, becoming 
               part of the rocket. Steam begins billowing, etc.

                                     NUMBER TWO

                         this.

               INT. JAIL CELL

               Austin and Felicity are in a bare cell with cement walls. 
               The huge metal door has a window with bars in it.

                                     FELICITY
                         How are we going to get out of here?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Why don't you just shag Fat Bastard 
                         again?

                                     FELICITY
                              (exploding)
                         Austin, that is it! I don't know 
                         what happened to you in the Nineties, 
                         but I'm still here, in the Sixties, 
                         and I still swing! Don't try to lay 
                         your hang-ups on me just because you 
                         lost your mojo! That one hurts.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Ouch, baby, very ouch. I'm wounded.

                                     FELICITY
                         I'm sorry, Austin, that was a cheap 
                         shot.

                                     AUSTIN
                         No, baby, you're right. I was wrong 
                         to judge you. I guess I am... jealous.

                                     FELICITY
                         But the Austin Powers I knew was 
                         wild and crazy and free. He could 
                         never be jealous.

                                     AUSTIN
                         That Austin is gone. I've changed. I 
                         knew someone, not long ago, a very 
                         special woman. She taught me that 
                         life isn't about jumping into the 
                         sack with whoever comes along, it's 
                         about caring and responsibility. And 
                         while it is true she turned out to 
                         be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, 
                         I suppose I really did... love her.

                                     FELICITY
                         Was that your wife?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Yes, Vanessa.

               Felicity is touched.

                                     FELICITY
                         Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to 
                         understand everything you've gone 
                         through, but I trust you. I'll make 
                         you a deal: if we get out of here 
                         alive, I'll give monogamy a try.

                                     AUSTIN
                         With me?

                                     FELICITY
                         Yes, silly.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Groovy, baby!

               They kiss.

                                     FELICITY
                         We need to lure the guard inside and 
                         get his key.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Alright, what if I pretend to be 
                         desperately ill with food poisoning? 
                         The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, 
                         will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, 
                         you dig a pit and line it with 
                         makeshift punji sticks made from 
                         sharpened toothbrushes. The guard 
                         falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've 
                         got the key.  What do you think?

                                     FELICITY
                         That might work, but how about this?

               Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping 
               open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. 
               We, however, can't see them.

                                     FELICITY
                              (giving a wolf whistle)
                         What do you think of these, my man?

               INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CELL

               The guard is mesmerized by Felicity.

                                     GUARD
                         Mommy...

               He unlocks the door and enters.

               INT. JAIL CELL

               The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin 
               is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce.

                                     FELICITY
                              (seductive, to guard)
                         It's very hot in here, don't you 
                         think?

               The guard follows her into the cell.

                                     FELICITY
                              (irritated)
                         It's very hot in here, don't you 
                         think?

               The guard advances on her.

                                     FELICITY
                              (breaking cover)
                         Austin!

                                     AUSTIN
                              (from above)
                         I'm very firmly wedged.

                                     FELICITY
                         If you want something done...

               She PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Almost... got it!

               Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Let's go get my mojo!

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE

               It is a stark, steel girder and glass structure. Dr. Evil is 
               trying to look dignified but he is FLOATING AWAY. He grabs 
               at the railing of his chair as his feet float up.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Has anyone seen my gravity booties? 
                         Honestly, all I wanted was a frickin' 
                         moon base. Hello, we're on the moon, 
                         no gravity?
                              (calling out)
                         Mini-Me? Are you alright?

               ANGLE ON THE TOP OF THE ROOM.

               Mini-Me is stuck to the top of the ceiling along with a lot 
               of DEBRIS.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         My frickin' mascot is stuck to the 
                         ceiling, OK? Not good. Papa not happy.

               A couple of henchmen place BOOTS on Dr. Evil. He drops to 
               the floor.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (looking up)
                         Somebody get the stick. Hold on, 
                         Mini-Me.

                         Begin laser-

               He's interrupted by terrible FEEDBACK. Dr. Evil taps and 
               blows on the mic.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         (into microphone).
                         Begin-

               Worse FEEDBACK. He holds it farther away.

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (into mic)
                         Begin laser ignition sequence.

               The laser's coils begin to glow RED.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

               Austin and Felicity run into the Main Room. It is strangely 
               dark and quiet.

                                     FELICITY
                         Where's your mojo, Austin?

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm not sure.

               MUSIC: It's Raining Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Suddenly, the 
               lights dim. The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on 
               trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Watch out, baby, He-Bots!

               The He-Bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like 
               a perfect Olympic dismount. Their crotch nozzles flip up one 
               by one.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I can't fight them without my mojo.

                                     FELICITY
                         Who said anything about fighting?

               MUSIC: seductive music Felicity does a very seductive dance, 
               with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. The He-Bots EXPLODE, 
               succumbing to her mojo.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Smashing, Felicity, you were making 
                         me very horny, man! Extremely randy, 
                         indeed!

                                     FAT BASTARD (O.S.)
                         C'mon, give the lads a show. Take of 
                         your top. Put 'em on the glass! Make 
                         'em bounce. Let's have a look at 
                         your tits.

               Austin and Felicity turn to see Fat Bastard lurking in the 
               background.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Looking for this, Mr. Powers?

               Fat Bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen 
               private army men.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Give me back my mojo, Fat Bastard!

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         I give the orders, (bleep) for brains. 
                         Guards, take them back to their cells.

               Guards approach.

                                     FELICITY
                         Hold on, let me ask you one question.

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Alright, I guess I owe you that much 
                         for a night of carnal ecstasy.

               Austin is grossed out.

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         What kind of stupid ass question is 
                         that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up 
                         to my tits in clean stinky.

                                     FELICITY
                         You didn't answer my question, are 
                         you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I 
                         could lose a few pounds, but I could 
                         shiva git!

                                     FELICITY
                         Are you happy?

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, 
                         I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger 
                         titties than you do! I've got more 
                         (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone 
                         book.  I've got more crack cheese 
                         than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay 
                         seen ma willie in two years. That's 
                         enough time to declare it legally 
                         deed! I can't stop eating. I eat 
                         because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy 
                         because I eat.
                              (starts to cry)
                         I'm caught in a cycle and there's no 
                         escape!

                         Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's 
                         a thin bastard, trying to get out

                                     FAT BASTARD
                         Maybe there's big crap inside me 
                         trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough 
                         of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. 
                         Listen, I've run the gamut of self- 
                         help books.  "Food isn't love", right, 
                         but how do you get it from the page 
                         to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak, 
                         I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, 
                         take the mojo.

               Fat Bastard hands over the mojo.

                         I appreciate you trying to reach me, 
                         no one can do it for me, I know this 
                         now.  There's a hole in my soul that 
                         food won't fill. This is the beginning 
                         of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym 
                         everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's 
                         someone I have to get in touch with 
                         and forgive... myself.

                         we understand that America's first 
                         manned mission to the moon will be 
                         blasting off shortly.

               Pan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her 
               spacesuit, then CAMEO ASTRONAUT in his space suit. They are 
               surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters.

                         Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket 
                         scientist to figure this stuff out.

                         I am a rocket scientist.

               A technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins.

                         We will have lift-off in T minus 10 
                         seconds... 9... 8... etc.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, if you get frightened, 
                         just hold my hand.

                         We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has 
                         cleared the tower and is heading for 
                         a rendezvous with the moon.

               INT. APOLLO CAPSULE

               The G-forces during lift-off are incredible. Austin's face 
               is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth. His 
               hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted.

               Austin is terrified. He clutches Felicity's hand, then grabs 
               on to the astronaut beside him.

               Felicity, however, loves it.

                         To be honest it was terrifying. It 
                         felt like sitting on top of a bomb. 
                         As I punched through the atmosphere, 
                         I said 'Oh my God!' and I soiled

                         when I said oh 'my God!'

                         This is one small step for man, but 
                         a giant step for shagging.  Can you

               settling into his chair. It is like that shot in 2001 SPACE

                                     AUSTIN
                         Oh, behave!

               Felicity runs ahead. Austin runs over to where the shadow 
               came from. He sees that it was not Dr. Evil, but MINI-ME, 
               carrying a little gun. Austin is ashamed.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger. He's so small, 
                         he's like a dog or something.

               Austin chokes back a tear.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Poor little bugger.
                              (realizing)
                         Felicity, be careful! Dr. Evil is 
                         still alive! Felicity?

               Austin runs after her.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

               Austin rounds the corner and comes upon Dr. Evil.

                                     AUSTIN
                              (holding his gun on 
                              Dr. Evil)
                         Alright, slap-head, turn around. 
                         Slowly.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Aren't you forgetting something?

               A wall panel in the main chamber revolves, revealing FELICITY, 
               enclosed in a glass tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!
                              (to Dr. Evil)
                         What have you done to her?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Don't worry, she's not dead... yet.

               Brightly colored GAS starts to fill the glass chamber.

                                     FELICITY
                              (muffled through glass)
                         Don't worry about me Austin. You've 
                         got to save the world!

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice, 
                         Powers: save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

               Austin is torn. He looks back and forth between Felicity and 
               the laser which is on the other side of the room.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I've got my mojo back, man, I can do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         We'll see. Fire the laser!

               The woman manning the laser's joystick begins to MOVE IT. 
               Austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Hands off my joystick, baby.

               He wrestles with her a moment and then KNOCKS IT ASKEW.

               EXT. SPACE

               The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big 
               Boy's eyes cross in pain.

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Damn you, Powers!

               Dr. Evil hits a SELF-DESTRUCT button. An ALARM blares.

                                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                         Warning! Self-destruct sequence 
                         initiated!

               The base is rocked by EXPLOSIONS.

                                     AUSTIN
                         See, Dr. Evil I told you I could do 
                         both.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Perhaps you spoke too soon.

               Austin looks over. Felicity has slumped over in the tube.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Noooooo!

               Austin BANGS on the glass with his fists.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity! Felicity. Wake up! Wake 
                         up! Please God, don't take her away.

               It is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and 
               gets away.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, you have to understand, I 
                         thought I had my mojo back.  This 
                         isn't fair.

               Austin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick--

               FLASHBACK - MONTAGE

               of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first 
               kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self.

               A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against 
               the glass as if trying to reach her.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I love you, Felicity! I know I 
                         couldn't say it before, but I really 
                         do love you!
                              (enraged)
                         Dr. Evil, I'll kill him!

               Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block 
               his path. Austin is like an animal.

               He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and 
               takes a bite out of it.

               Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE 
               OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

               The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists 
               simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE 
               A PUMPKIN.

               Austin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for "75 BC". He runs 
               through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC

               An orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel 
               with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You make love to your wife out of 
                         duty, your mistress for pleasure, 
                         and a Roman boy for ecstasy.
                              (noticing Austin)
                         Shit.

               He runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin 
               follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked "1975".

               EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD -

               Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting 
               into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO 
               with a white stripe pulls over.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I have to commandeer this vehicle.
                              (noticing)
                         Hey, aren't you Hutch?

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

               We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY).

                                     PAUL MICHAEL GLASER
                         I'm Starsky.

                                     DAVID SOUL
                         I'm Hutch.

               Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car 
               disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino 
               follows.

               A sign at the car wash reads: "1911"

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC -

               Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic" 
               stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with 
               Austin hot on his heels.

                                     CAPTAIN (O.S.)
                         Iceberg, dead ahead!

               Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, 
               KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by.

                                     JAMES CAMERON
                         I'm king of the world!

               Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL 
               they just came from.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY -

               Dr. Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him. In 
               SLO-MO Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and TACKLES 
               Dr.  Evil, pinning him.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I'm going to kill you, you bastard!

                                     DR. EVIL
                              (breathing heavily)
                         Before you do that, know this: Austin, 
                         I am... your... father.

               MUSIC: DRAMATIC STING

                                     AUSTIN
                         Really?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         No. I can't back that up. I was just 
                         grasping at straws. I had nothing. 
                         But isn't it interesting, Mr. Powers, 
                         you really have become a product of 
                         the Nineties.

                                     AUSTIN
                         How so?

                                     DR. EVIL
                         You're more interested in your job 
                         as glorified policeman than you are 
                         in love. You won the battle, but I 
                         won the war. Love means nothing, 
                         you've proved it.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I didn't think that Felicity was 
                         going to die, man.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         What a cowardly response. I'm 
                         disappointed really. You have the 
                         power to go back in time and save 
                         her, but it means letting me go.

               Austin looks over and sees a TIME PORTAL. Through it he can 
               glimpse the lair, and Felicity.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Well, Mr. Powers, which is it going 
                         to be? Me or the girl?

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity!

               Austin runs through.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - 60'S

               We see the scene from a moment ago. Felicity is in the glass 
               tube and the BRIGHTLY COLORED GAS is starting to fill it.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         It looks like you have a choice: 
                         save the world, or save your 
                         girlfriend.

                                     AUSTIN
                         I choose love, baby.

               Austin runs over to the glass tube and SMASHES HIS FIST 
               through it. The glass SHATTERS and Austin pulls Felicity 
               out. She gasps for air.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Felicity, I love you.

                                     FELICITY
                              (breathless)
                         But I thought-

                                     AUSTIN
                         That was another place and another 
                         time, baby.

               Austin kisses her for a long time. She starts to twitch.

               She struggles. She hits him in the head and he finally stops 
               kissing her.

                                     FELICITY
                              (gasping)
                         Can't. Breathe.

                                     AUSTIN
                         Sorry, baby, I got a little over- 
                         stimulated.

                                     DR. EVIL
                         Fire the laser!

                                     AUSTIN
                         What do we do?

                                     FELICITY
                         Use your mojo!

                                     AUSTIN
                         I don't have it!

                                     FELICITY
                         Trust me, you do!

               Austin turns and gives a 'who me?' look over his bottom. The 
               woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional 
               control just as it FIRES.

               EXT. SPACE

               The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes 
               harmlessly by.

               Dr. Evil hits the SELF-DESTRUCT button and climbs aboard the

                         Come with me, Felicity! It's the 
                         only way out!

                         If I did, anyone can. Let's go, baby!

               The TIME PORTAL is fifty feet away. Austin and Felicity run 
               towards it. In the foreground, are a stack of conveniently 
               placed barrels. As they run behind the barrels, an obvious 
               AUSTIN STUNT DOUBLE and an obvious FELICITY STUNT DOUBLE 
               emerge in their place.

               The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross 
               over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic 
               flips and stunts.

               The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed 
               pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place 
               and run through the TIME PORTAL. The TIME PORTAL reads "1999".

               It is the most up-to-date modern apartment you've ever seen

               Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other 
               accouterments of moving. Felicity puts a CD on an old style 
               turntable.

                         used to. Let me ask you Felicity, do 
                         you feel any side effects from the

                                     FELICITY

                                     AUSTIN

                                   SHOOTING DRAFT (1984)

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. ST. ANN'S SCHOOL - DAY

               CAMERA PANS a group of freshly-scrubbed, innocent children, 
               obediently standing in line, like recruits for the Holy 
               Crusade. PULL BACK to REVEAL they are wearing the gray 
               blazers, striped ties and navy slacks of St. Luke's School. 
               They are waiting patiently at the curbside in front of the 
               statue of the school's sainted namesake. One of the fifth 
               grade BOYS pokes the KID next to him with his elbow. The 
               other Kid is about to retaliate when SISTER MARY FRANCIS, a 
               stern-faced nun, appears behind them, grabbing them both 
               firmly by the shoulders.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                         Make one more move and you'll both 
                         be staying late for the rest of the 
                         week.

                                     THE BOYS
                              (softly; in unison)
                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                         I didn't hear you.

                                     THE BOYS
                              (louder)
                         Sorry, Sister Mary Francis.

               Sister Mary Francis checks her watch. She scowls and looks 
               out past the parking lot gate.

               Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of an ENGINE roaring at full 
               throttle. There is a SCREECHING of BRAKES, followed by the 
               loud GRINDING of GEARS. It sounds like the Indy 500 is taking 
               place around the corner.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                              (used to this)
                         Step away from the curb, children.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Zooming through the parking lot gates is a large yellow school 
               bus. It practically takes the last turn on just two wheels. 
               The bus driver quickly slams on the brakes, leaving ten feet 
               of rubber behind him as the bus comes to an ear-splitting 
               halt right in front of them. The front door immediately swings 
               open and RICK STAHL, the driver, hops out. Rick is the life 
               of the party, even when there isn't any party going on.

               While chronologically older than the St. Luke students, the 
               only thing that sets him apart from them is that he has a 
               driver's license. Rick figures he'll live up to his 
               capabilities and get serious in his next life... This 
               incarnation's strictly for laughs. Sister Mary Francis steps 
               up to him.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                         You're late again, Rick.

                                     RICK
                         I know, Sister, but I have a very 
                         good excuse.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                         There can be no excuse for tardiness.

                                     RICK
                         You're absolutely right. I should 
                         never have stopped to save that 
                         drowning infant. I'm just weak, 
                         Sister; I'm so weak.

               He starts sobbing softly into his hands.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                         All right, stop that... Children, on 
                         the bus.

               The kids obediently file past Rick, who makes like he is 
               drying his tears with his handkerchief.

                                     RICK
                         Sister, do you ever get lonely after 
                         vespers? If you do, why don't you 
                         give me a call. I'm in the book.

                                     SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                              (smiling despite 
                              herself)
                         Get going, Rick... you're late enough 
                         as it is.

                                     RICK
                         Right... Think it over.

               He hops on the bus, closes the door and gently backs the bus 
               out of the parking lot.

               INT. BUS - DAY

               As soon as the bus is out of sight of the school, all hell 
               breaks loose. The formally well-mannered children are acting 
               like normal kids... hitting each other over the heads with 
               books, running up and down the aisles, screaming at the top 
               of their lungs.

               ANGLE - RICK

               He removes the St. Christopher statue from the dashboard, 
               revealing a hulaing Hawaiian girl in a grass skirt. He watches 
               the madness behind him in his rearview mirror, picks up the 
               P.A. microphone and rationally attempts to restore order.

                                     RICK
                              (over mike)
                         If you don't all calm down I'm gonna 
                         drive this thing over a cliff.

               The kids pay no attention to him.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing; 
                              philosophically)
                         Ah... youth.

               EXT. THE BUS

               Rick's bus pulls up to a light and another school bus filled 
               with kids (from a public school) pulls up alongside of it. 
               The other DRIVER gives Rick a competitive smirk and guns his 
               engine. Rick counters by gunning his.

               INT. THE BUS

               All the kids start screaming "Race... race." "Wipe 'em out." 
               "Go for it." Etc. Some of the kids even start taking out 
               money and start betting one another on the race's outcome.

               ANGLE - RICK

               as he readies for action.

               EXT. THE BUSES

               The light turns green and they're off. Or as off as two lunky 
               school buses filled with kids can be.

               WIDE SHOT - ANOTHER STREET

               The two buses come zooming down the street.

               INT. RICK'S BUS

               The kids are screaming at Rick to go faster. One of the little 
               boys looks nauseous as he clutches the seat in front of him.

               EXT. THE STREET - LOW ANGLE

               The buses squeeze down a narrow street, neck and neck with 
               one another.

               INT. THE BUS

               The kids are all yelling words of encouragement to Rick, who 
               is hunched over in his seat, driving with the determination 
               of Andy Granitelli. The nauseous kid is now turning a pale 
               shade of green. He moves to an open window, straining to 
               control the inevitable.

               EXT. THE BUSES

               They race down a steep hill.

               INT. THE BUS

               The nauseous kid can't hold it any longer.

               EXT. THE OTHER BUS

               Something hits with a splat against the windshield that 
               resembles Campbell's Chunky Vegetable Soup.

               INT. THE OTHER BUS

               The other Driver turns on the windshield. It only makes it 
               worse.

               EXT. THE STREET

               Rick's bus pulls out in front, accompanied by the cheering 
               of his passengers. Suddenly a stop light looms ahead. Rick 
               puts on his brakes. Both buses stop just in time.

               INT. RICK'S BUS

               Rick's kids are all piled in a clump right behind him in the 
               front of the bus. Although disheveled, the kids still manage 
               a victorious cheer.

               PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV

               We're LOOKING THROUGH the camera lens. We SEE a cute one-
               year-old baby boy. He's sitting on a cuddly blanket. We HEAR 
               the VOICE of Jay O'Neill. He is a baby photographer at Sears.

                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
                         Okay, Timmy... hold that smile... 
                         and watch the birdie.

               He takes the picture and we SEE the camera flash.

                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
                         There.

               O'NEILL

               We see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera 
               department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest 
               of the store. He's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest 
               and tie. He looks like he could be a Young Republican. But 
               under those Sears clothes is a man a little off center. Rick's 
               best friend. Need we say more? He takes the film out of the 
               camera. The matronly mother is in the process of gathering 
               up her baby.

                                     O'NEILL
                         These should be in the mail to you 
                         by next Friday.

               She smiles and exits.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         Next.

               A beautiful -- and we're talking gorgeous -- WOMAN enters. 
               Her clothes hug every curve of her body. She has her baby in 
               her arms. O'Neill immediately wants her, and now. His eyes 
               settle onto her full breasts. These he likes.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         Whoa. Look at those babies.

               She gets this innuendo and loves it.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. 
                         And you are...?

                                     WOMAN
                         Klupner.
                              (teasing)
                         Mrs. Klupner.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Mrs.?

                                     WOMAN
                         I'm separated.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Then there is a God. Why don't we 
                         take that baby picture.

               He takes the baby. He has a hard time taking his eyes off 
               her breasts. He places the baby on the blanket.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         If I were you, I'd breast feed until 
                         I was 17 or 18.
                              (gets behind camera; 
                              sizing up the shot)
                         Tell ya what...

               O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH CAMERA

               We SEE the baby sitting on the blanket.

                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
                         Why don't you lean into the picture 
                         with your child?

               She coyly leans INTO FRAME.

                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         A-huh. A little more... good!

               She is totally blocking her baby out of the picture.

               O'NEILL

               He gets out from behind the camera.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I'm getting one heck of a glare off 
                         your dress there. Could you undo a 
                         few buttons?

                                     WOMAN
                              (seductively)
                         Of course.

               She starts to unbutton her blouse. O'Neill looks into his 
               camera.

               O'NEILL'S POV THROUGH LENS

               We SEE the Woman finish her last button.

                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
                         Now lean in a little more... more... 
                         more...

               As she complies, her breasts all but spill out of her dress.

                                     O'NEILL (O.S.)
                              (continuing)
                         Hold that pose.

               O'NEILL

               He runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman.

               THROUGH CAMERA LENS

               We SEE a QUICK SERIES of camera flashes. Each pose finds him 
               near her breasts. He has them on his head. He's cheek to 
               breast. Etc.

               RICK

               enters and witnesses the photo session. He immediately jumps 
               into the shots.

               THROUGH CAMERA LENS

               Rick joins the craziness. After several beats, the Woman 
               gets bored and EXITS the FRAME.

               THE WOMAN

               As Rick and O'Neill continue mugging like two 12-year-olds 
               in a photo booth, the Woman takes her child and exits. A few 
               beats pass and the guys notice they're alone.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Where'd she go?

                                     RICK
                         She probably had sex scheduled for 
                         12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the 
                         guys for a drink... I have major 
                         news to announce.

               O'Neill crosses to his camera and takes out the film.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Okay... be right with ya.

               RICK

               He picks up some photographs of today's work.

               INSERT - PHOTOS

               Each one has a different mother in several seductive poses. 
               Their babies are barely visible, if at all.

                                     RICK (O.S.)
                         Pictures a family will cherish 
                         forever.

               EXT. CHULO'S AUTO SHOP - DAY

               Rick's school bus pulls into the yard of the auto shop. 
               Several Chicanos are working on various cars. Rick and O'Neill 
               hop out.

                                     RICK
                         Hey, Chulo, where are you, man?

               ANGLE - LATE-MODEL CAR

               We SEE a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under 
               the chassis. Slowly, a large, bear-like body rolls out and 
               we catch our first glimpse of CHULO. A happy-go-lucky mechanic 
               of Mexican ancestry.

                                     CHULO
                         Hey, you guys, what's going on?

                                     RICK
                         We're going for a little liquid 
                         refreshment.

                                     CHULO
                         Great. I'll go with you. Wait a 
                         second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, 
                         will you?

               A SMALL MECHANIC with an eye patch gets into a car behind 
               them as we DOLLY WITH the guys THROUGH the lot.

                                     CHULO
                              (continuing)
                         Roberto, you finished fixing that 
                         lighter yet?

               Another MECHANIC sticks his face out of another car and shakes 
               his head. Just then Raul, the eye-patched worker, whizzes by 
               behind the guys, driving the car in a zig-zag pattern right 
               into traffic.

                                     CHULO
                              (continuing; to Rick)
                         I'm glad you guys came by... What's 
                         the occasion?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Rick's got an important announcement 
                         to make.

                                     CHULO
                         Yeah. What is it?

                                     RICK
                         I've decided not to run for President.

                                     CHULO
                         Too bad, man, that blows my chance 
                         to be Ambassador to France.

               Behind them we can SEE Roberto fiddling with the lighter. 
               Suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing Roberto ten 
               feet into the air.

               ANGLE

               The guys all start to pile into the bus. Nearby another 
               employee is washing down the garage with a hose.

               Chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the 
               hood of a car.

                                     CHULO
                         Manuel, be sure and finish up the 
                         electrical system on that Chevy.

               Manuel waves at Chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. Rick starts 
               it up and starts to drive away. Just as the bus CLEARS FRAME, 
               we SEE Manuel connect two wires together at the same moment 
               the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. 
               Manuel lights up like a Christmas tree, screaming in pain. 
               There is a beat, and then Robert falls INTO FRAME, still 
               holding the cigarette lighter, and the car Raul is driving 
               enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.

               INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

               A sign on an office door says "CONCERT TICKET AGENCY." From 
               inside we HEAR someone TALKING loudly on the phone. Chulo, 
               Rick and O'Neill open the door and go inside. On the walls 
               in the cramped office there are rock 'n' roll concert posters 
               advertising rock bands like Men At Work, The Clash and Barry 
               Manilow. Behind a cluttered desk we FIND a little man with a 
               thin mustache and horn-rimmed glasses. This is GARY MELNITZ, 
               wheeler-dealer, entrepreneur and coward. Gary yells a lot, 
               which is a definite overcompensation for his size and 
               inability to deal with the opposite sex.

                                     GARY
                              (yelling; into phone)
                         Screw you... Screw that... Don't 
                         jerk me around. You promised me 1500 
                         seats for the Police Concert... 1500, 
                         not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw 
                         you -- Screw Sting.
                              (hangs up and sees 
                              the guys standing 
                              there)
                         Hi, guys.

                                     RICK
                         Gary, you're quite an animal.

                         Screw you...

                         Okay. Let's go.

               He gets up and they start for the door. Just then the PHONE 
               RINGS. Gary picks it up.

               The guys all laugh and exit.

               INT. HARBORSIDE INN - DAY

               It's a quiet restaurant near a Marina. A lot of business-
               people in suits are eating.

               TWO MALE CUSTOMERS

               CUSTOMER ONE calls for a waiter.

                                     CUSTOMER ONE
                         Waiter.

               The WAITER approaches them from OUT OF FRAME.

                                     CUSTOMER ONE
                         We'd like to order now.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               We see their waiter, RYKO, a blond, tanned, muscular beach 
               bum who has definitely stayed out in the sun too long.

                                     RYKO
                         How you guys doin'... Could you 
                         believe how overcast it was this 
                         morning? Bad day for sailin', waves 
                         are too rough and...

                                     CUSTOMER
                              (annoyed)
                         You can skip the small craft warnings. 
                         We're in a hurry.

                                     RYKO
                         No prob, bud... Here's today's 
                         dealie...

               He holds up a blackboard with the day's menu.

                                     RYKO
                         We got... uh, veal... ah... veal...
                              (to customer)
                         What's this word?

                                     CUSTOMER ONE
                         Parmisan.

                                     RYKO
                         Yeah right. I always want to say 
                         Paramisian when I see that. We looked 
                         at them under the jigamabob in biology 
                         once. Little squirmy, creepy things 
                         that live in your intestine and...

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Please... We have an appointment in 
                         a half hour...

                                     RYKO
                         Wow, sounds stressful. What do you 
                         guys do for a living?

                                     CUSTOMER ONE
                         We're lawyers.

                                     RYKO
                         Whoa... You got to go to school for 
                         that or what?

                                     CUSTOMER
                              (he's had enough)
                         Look, forget the specials. We'll 
                         take three hamburgers.

                                     RYKO
                         Okay, great... Any of you guys got a 
                         pencil by any chance?

               One of the customers shrugs and hands him a pen.

                                     RYKO
                              (impressed)
                         All right, a Bic... How 'bout a piece 
                         of paper?

               Ryko's customers look totally disgusted as Ryko's short 
               attention span is interrupted by something he sees O.S.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rick and the guys appear in the bar.

                                     RICK
                         Ryko. Come on!

               They all disappear into the bar area.

                                     RYKO
                         Be right there.
                              (to customers)
                         Nice rappin' with you guys. 
                         Unfortunately I'm outta here. Someone 
                         else will have to help you.
                              (calling off)
                         Skip!

               The customers are pleased to get rid of Ryko. SKIP enters. 
               He's a clone of Ryko.

                                     SKIP
                         Like um... What's the deal, you guys 
                         gonna order?

               The customers give each other a "Here we go again" look

               ANGLE - THE GUYS

               They're laughing uproariously and carrying on as Ryko comes 
               over and sits down.

                                     RYKO
                         Hi pals.

               The guys acknowledge him.

                         Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's 
                         the big announcement?

                         sugar-coat this thing. I've known 
                         you guys since grade school, so I'm 
                         gonna give it to you straight from 
                         the hip... right from the shoulder... 
                         without beating around the bush... 
                         Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard 
                         facts... tell it like it is.

                         Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, 
                         I lose my amateur standing and turn 
                         pro.

                         Hey, man, congratulations!

               Chulo gets up and gives Rick a big bear hug... The other 
               guys shake his hand.

                                     RICK
                         No more raping and pillaging, either. 
                         You'll have to carry on without me.

                         go through with this, the least we

                         party with drugs, booze and broads.

               As they down their drinks, we:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY

               We SEE a couple of very contemporary looking 15-year-olds 
               going into a very "now" clothing store -- like Fred Segal's... 
               When the door opens, loud ROCK 'N ROLL MUSIC blasts out.

               INT. THE JEAN MACHINE - DAY

               Inside the store we see all the sales clerks grooving 
               narcissistically to the music like they're at a disco. The 
               cashier, PHOEBE, has devoted her life to following the current 
               trends and fads no matter how inane they may be. Today she's 
               in a reggae mode, her hair wound into tight dreadlocks, as 
               she sways lost in the ozone to the music. A CUSTOMER 
               approaches her with a purchase.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         I'd like to pay for these.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Huh... What... Oh sure, wait till 
                         this song is over.

               She floats off again...

               One of the young MALE CUSTOMERS approaches an attractive 
               salesgirl. This is DEBBIE THOMERSON, Rick's intended. She 
               seems to be the only sane employee in the place because she's 
               actually working, putting clothes on the racks. This 
               impression of sanity fits her, as she is level-headed, and 
               has a clear sense of herself. She can also take a joke, thus 
               her engagement to Rick.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Excuse me, where can I try on these 
                         pants?

                                     DEBBIE
                         Right over here.

               She leads the Customer to the try-on booths. The Customer 
               enters one. We SEE that the saloon-style doors of the booths 
               have been hung too high, so as he takes off his pants, his 
               underwear is exposed to the world. We PULL BACK, REVEALING 
               other people in other booths, their bare asses clearly in 
               sight. No one in the store seems to care, however, as they 
               are much too busy dancing.

               The front door opens and BOBBIE, a very sultry and earthy-
               looking girl with long, dark hair, pushes inside. She is 
               O'Neill's girl and Debbie's best friend... She's also someone 
               who would party every night if given half a chance.

                              (excited)
                         Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so 
                         excited.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Bobbie, what are you talking about?

                                     BOBBIE
                         O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo 
                         great... I don't believe it.

               Phoebe crosses to them.

                                     PHOEBE
                         What's happening?

                                     BOBBIE
                         Debbie's marrying Rick.

                                     PHOEBE
                         ...Really?

                                     DEBBIE
                         Yes, it's true.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Ohmygod.

               The girls screech and jump around, hugging each other in 
               sheer joy. A MALE CUSTOMER, moved by this outpouring of 
               affection, moves over and gets in the middle of the girls, 
               enjoying every moment of being hugged by three women at once.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (to Customer; realizing)
                         Would you get out of here.

               Reluctantly the guy retreats back to the Calvin Klein jeans 
               rack.

                                     BOBBIE
                         Does Cole know about this?

                                     PHOEBE
                         Really -- you went with him for two 
                         years.

                                     DEBBIE
                         He still thinks I'm going with him. 
                         I'm going to break the news to him 
                         tomorrow.

                                     BOBBIE
                         He's not gonna be happy. And your 
                         parents can't be too thrilled either.

                                     DEBBIE
                         No. As far as they're concerned the 
                         only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I 
                         don't care... it's my decision.

                                     PHOEBE
                              (oblivious)
                         I'm totally blown away. You're getting 
                         married. It seems like only yesterday 
                         I showed you how to have oral sex.

                                     BOBBIE
                         Deb, I want to throw you a shower.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Oh, that's really sweet. I'd love 
                         that.

                                     PHOEBE
                         We'll invite all the girls.

                                     BOBBIE
                         I don't believe it... Mrs. Rick Stahl.

               The girls all start to scream and carry on all over again.

               INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Rick is cooking dinner in the cramped combination kitchen / 
               living room. He has about five dishes going at once as he 
               dashes from stove to refrigerator. He grabs some hamburger 
               meat, rolls it into a ball, then slaps it on the counter. He 
               then takes a steam iron and presses it on the patty.

               Debbie comes in the front door and crosses to him and hugs 
               him tightly, kissing him sweetly.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (between kisses)
                         God, you're a slob.

                                     RICK
                         But a fabulous cook.

                                     DEBBIE
                         What are we having?

                                     RICK
                         It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or 
                         charred flesh. I won't know till 
                         it's finished.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (looking at the stove)
                         I think your dinner's burning.

               Rick crosses to the stove. A small fire is coming out of one 
               of the frying pans. He douses it with water.

                                     RICK
                         Don't worry... it's supposed to do 
                         this.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (setting the table)
                         Want to hear something great? Bobbie 
                         and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. 
                         It's really gonna be fun.

                                     RICK
                         Not as much fun as the bachelor party 
                         the guys are throwing for me.

                                     DEBBIE
                         You're going to have a bachelor party?

                                     RICK
                         Of course. I'm a traditional guy... 
                         It's a traditional event.
                              (he brings all the 
                              food to the table)
                         Well, what do you think?

                                     DEBBIE
                         It looks awful.

                                     RICK
                         Yes, but looks are deceiving...
                              (takes a bite)
                         Not in this case, however.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Are you going to have women at your 
                         party?

                                     RICK
                         No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. 
                         Does stay home.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I'm not talking about does. I'm 
                         talking about hookers.

                                     RICK
                         Oh, those. Why do you ask?

                                     DEBBIE
                         Because from what I've heard, it's a 
                         tradition and you're a traditional 
                         guy.

               Rick grabs her; starts kissing her passionately on the neck.

                                     RICK
                         Deb, you is my woman now. I is yo 
                         man. No painted lady ever gonna come 
                         between us.

                                     DEB
                         I need you to promise.

                                     RICK
                         Okay, you got it. I got a way we can 
                         seal the deal -- what'd you say?

               He grabs her. They kiss and slide down onto the table, 
               knocking the dishes to the floor.

               EXT. BEL AIR-TYPE ESTATE - DAY

               Through the iron gates of an impressive-looking estate comes 
               Debbie in her convertible VW Rabbit. She pulls up behind a 
               new Porsche 911 and a Jeep, all decked out with rifles, nets 
               and other hunting equipment. As she walks down the path toward 
               the house, she sees something off in the distance that 
               startles her.

               DEBBIE'S POV

               A large brown grizzly bear appears to be entering the side 
               door of the house.

               ANGLE - DEBBIE

                                     DEBBIE
                              (calling O.S.)
                         Cole?... Cole!

               DEBBIE'S POV

               The "Bear" turns around. We SEE that the bear is, in fact, 
               dead. It is being carried by a tall, handsome HUNTER. He 
               waves to Debbie and indicates for her to follow him inside.

               INT. COLE'S SMOKEHOUSE - DAY

               Debbie opens a rustic-looking door and peers in.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Cole?

                                     COLE (O.S.)
                         Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.

               CAMERA PANS WITH Debbie as she enters the room. She passes 
               several trophies, guns and stuffed animal heads hanging from 
               the wall. She makes her way past some sections of an 
               undetermined animal's anatomy hanging from hooks suspended 
               from the ceiling. Finally we see COLE WHITTIER, a Steve Garvey 
               look-alike... rugged all-American, and heir to the Whittier 
               Plastic Wrap fortune. Despite his jockish good looks and 
               outward arrogance, there's something in his manner that is 
               definitely unsavory.

               As Debbie approaches him we SEE that he is butchering some 
               unfortunate friend of the forest on the table in front of 
               him. (NOTE: For the squeamish, all of this is done OUT OF 
               FRAME. The only thing we should HEAR are the delightful SOUNDS 
               of TAXIDERMY.)

                                     COLE
                         Hi, Deb. Just got back from the 
                         mountains.
                              (as he cuts in with a 
                              surgeon's skill)
                         Isn't this a beauty?... It's gonna 
                         look great in the den.

               Debbie tries her best not to look down at what he's doing.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Cole, we've got to talk.

                                     COLE
                         Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?

                                     DEBBIE
                         No, Cole, I...

                                     COLE
                              (lifting an organ of 
                              some sort O.S.)
                         It's all right, I forgive you. I'm 
                         not the vengeful type. We'll forget 
                         what happened. Why don't we take a 
                         trip together? Maybe kill a few lions 
                         in Kenya over Christmas.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Cole, listen to me... I've got to 
                         tell you...

                                     COLE
                         You know, when you dumped me for 
                         that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll 
                         be back. God wants the two of you to 
                         be together, and sure enough...

                                     DEBBIE
                         Cole, I'm marrying Rick.

                                     COLE
                              (confused)
                         You're marrying him? Then why are 
                         you coming back to me?

                                     DEBBIE
                         I'm not. I just thought I should 
                         tell you myself before you heard it 
                         somewhere else.

               Cole stops what he is doing for a beat and just stares at 
               Debbie intensely. Then he returns to his work with a renewed 
               enthusiasm, chopping, slashing and slicing.

                                     COLE
                         You know how that makes me feel, 
                         Deb? Wanta know how that makes me 
                         feel?
                              (softly)
                         Angry, Deb.
                              (a little louder)
                         Yesss, that's the word, angry. But 
                         if he makes you happy, you go right 
                         ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.
                              (a little nuts)
                         No matter what, no matter how angry 
                         it makes me, no matter how much it 
                         hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, 
                         very happy.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Cole, I'm sorry, I...

                                     COLE
                         That's all right, Deb. Go be happy 
                         and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (uncomfortable)
                         I'm going now, Cole.

                                     COLE
                         I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.

               Debbie exits and we PUSH IN ON Cole. Something on his face 
               says, "Hi! I'm really out of my mind."

               INT. DR. STAN STAHL'S OFFICE - DAY

               DR. STAN is Rick's older brother and a proctologist. Although 
               he's only in his early thirties, he thinks and acts like 
               someone in their early 70's. A little on the pompous side, 
               Stan is never without his pipe.

                                     STAN
                         Okay, Rick, hold out your arm.

               He crosses to a sterile container and takes out a syringe.

                                     RICK
                         You wouldn't hurt your own brother, 
                         would you?
                              (looking at the needle 
                              cautiously)
                         I changed my mind. I don't need a 
                         blood test. The marriage is off. I --

               Just then, Stan sticks the needle in his arm.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         You always were sneaky, Stan, very 
                         sneaky.

                                     STAN
                         Rick, marriage will be good for you. 
                         It's done wonders for me.

                                     RICK
                         True, you're a lot handsomer now. 
                         Don't you have enough blood already?

                                     STAN
                              (without much 
                              conviction)
                         You won't miss a thing about being 
                         single... The wild parties, the 
                         different girls every night, running 
                         around like a maniac... God, I miss 
                         that.

                                     RICK
                         Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I 
                         didn't know you were going to fill 
                         'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, 
                         okay?

               Stan removes the needle and hands Rick a cotton ball.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         That's an even trade... a cotton 
                         ball for all my blood.

                                     STAN
                              (returning to this 
                              world)
                         Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't 
                         wait for that bachelor party... I 
                         need the action.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they go out into the hall.

                                     STAN
                              (continuing)
                         Don't say anything to my wife about 
                         it.

               They pass an open examining room. Stan's wife, TINA, is also 
               a doctor and is examining an old man. She's not as tiny as 
               her name suggests. In face, she's more like over-sized.

                                     RICK
                         Hi, Tina.

               Rick moves to hug her and he notices that Tina has her finger 
               up the old guy's ass.

                                     TINA
                              (looking up)
                         Rick...
                              (to PATIENT)
                         Mr. Goldsmith, this is my brother-in-
                         law. He's getting married.

                                     PATIENT
                              (without turning around)
                         Congratulations.

               Tina turns to a NURSE.

                                     TINA
                         Nurse, will you take over?

               The nurse shrugs and sticks her finger up the patient's rear 
               end as Tina hugs Rick.

                                     TINA
                              (continuing)
                         I'm so happy for you.

               Rick hugs her, uneasily trying to make sure her right hand 
               doesn't come anywhere near his face.

               EXT. DEBBIE'S PARENTS' HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

               Debbie and Rick and her MOM and DAD are having a frustrating 
               game of tennis behind her parents' plush home. Mr. Thomerson 
               is a stockily-built guy in his fifties who prides himself on 
               being tough and competitive. His wife loves to shop. As far 
               as she's concerned, appearances are everything. Neither of 
               them likes Rick's appearance or anything else about their 
               future son-in-law. Mr. Thomerson slams the ball to Rick; 
               Rick slams the ball back and drives it over the fence, out 
               of the court.

                                     RICK
                         Oops!

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                              (frustrated)
                         All right, who serves?

                                     DEBBIE
                         You do, Daddy.

               Mr. Thomerson serves the ball to Debbie, who hits it over 
               the net to her mother, who hits it to Rick, who slams it 
               over the fence, out of the court. Mr. Thomerson does not 
               look pleased.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You 
                         don't have to kill it.

                                     RICK
                         Can't I just maim it a little?

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         No. Let's at least finish the set.

               Rick starts humming the "ABC Wide World of Sports" theme 
               loudly. Mr. T. gives him a disgusted look and serves the 
               ball. Rick smashes the ball and sends it over the fence, out 
               of the court.

               EXT. THE THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' BACKYARD - DAY

               A middle-aged COUPLE are sitting on some lawn furniture trying 
               to read the newspaper. A tennis ball comes down from the sky 
               and hits the guy squarely on the top of the head. PULL OUT 
               to REVEAL that they're surrounded by dozens of tennis balls.

                                     MAN
                         One of these days I'm gonna burn 
                         Thomerson's court to the ground.

               EXT. THE THOMERSON'S - MEDIUM SHOT - DAY

               Rick and Mr. Thomerson are having a heart to heart chat over 
               some lemonade in front of the tennis court.

                                     RICK
                         Well, I have to admit my game's a 
                         little rusty, but I love polo. It's 
                         unrelenting, a constant challenge to 
                         the senses. Really a beautiful 
                         experience.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.

                                     RICK
                         I'd love that.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                              (sitting on his anger)
                         Good. I think you're an asshole. No, 
                         let me correct that, an immature 
                         asshole. Which is fine, except you're 
                         marrying my daughter and I'm afraid 
                         my grandchildren are going to be 
                         little assholes.

                                     RICK
                         Mr. Thomerson, I...

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. 
                         She can do what she wants. But if 
                         you want your marriage to last, you're 
                         going to have to change some things 
                         about yourself. If I may make some 
                         suggestions...

                                     RICK
                         Feel free.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         First, you're a slob. You have to 
                         dress for success. Second, your 
                         outlook on life...

               As Mr. Thomerson drones on, Rick shifts uncomfortably in his 
               chair, focusing his attention on Debbie, her mother and her 
               older, cynical cousin, ILENE, who are sitting nearby on the 
               rear patio.

               ANGLE - DEBBIE, MRS. THOMERSON AND ILENE

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         I'm using the same caterer for the 
                         shower I had for our Christmas party 
                         last year.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Great, Mom.

                                     ILENE
                         If I were you, I'd worry less about 
                         the shower and more about Rick's 
                         bachelor party.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Ilene, why would I want to do that? 
                         I trust Rick.

                                     ILENE
                         Of course you do. I trusted my ex, 
                         Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk 
                         from experience. What do you think 
                         they do at these parties, have tea 
                         and play scrabble?

                                     DEBBIE
                         Ilene, Rick promised...

                                     ILENE
                         Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.

                              subject)
                         Girls, why don't we go inside for 
                         lunch.
                              (calling to Mr. T)
                         Boys, would you mind bringing in 
                         that lemonade?

               ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON AND RICK

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         In a second...
                              (to Rick)
                         And you're irresponsible. Show some 
                         initiative, try to better yourself, 
                         stop showing off, actions speak louder 
                         than words.

                                     RICK
                         Well, sir, that's quite a list. But 
                         you're absolutely right. And if I 
                         work hard at it, I think I can be a 
                         totally changed person by the time 
                         we finish lunch...

               Mr. Thomerson rolls his eyes, knowing he's been wasting his 
               breath. He grabs the pitcher of lemonade and Rick grabs the 
               tray, which is filled with fresh lemons. They get up at the 
               same time and collide, sending the lemonade all over Mr. T., 
               and the lemons bounding over the fence.

               EXT. THOMERSON'S NEIGHBORS' HOUSE

               The Neighbor we saw before is reading his paper when an 
               avalanche of lemons comes flying at him, joining the tennis 
               balls on the lawn.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         I hate those people... I really do.

               INT. THOMERSON HOUSE - DAY

               The Thomersons, Rick, Debbie and Ilene are just finishing 
               lunch. The DOORBELL RINGS. Mr. Thomerson gets up to answer 
               it. Standing there is Cole, wearing his tennis shorts.

                                     COLE
                         Hi, everybody. Am I late?

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Not at all. We're just finishing 
                         lunch.

               Cole crosses to the table and kisses Mrs. T's hand gallantly.

                                     COLE
                         Good to see you, Mrs. Thomerson. 
                         Hello, Debbie.

               He turns to Rick.

                                     COLE
                              (continuing)
                         And...

                                     RICK
                         Bond... James Bond.

               Cole gives him a quick look of contempt and exits with Mr. 
               T.

                                     MR. THOMERSON (O.S.)
                         So, Cole, you been practicing your 
                         game?

                                     COLE (O.S.)
                         Sure have...

                                     DEBBIE
                         Why is Cole here?

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         You know your father enjoys his 
                         company.

                                     RICK
                         Much the way Hitler enjoyed hanging 
                         out with Mussolini.

               EXT. THOMERSON TENNIS COURT - DAY

               Mr. T. and Cole are having a fast-paced game.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Nice shot.

                                     COLE
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         I know you're as unhappy as I am 
                         about Debbie's marriage to Rick.

                                     COLE
                         Yes, sir, I am.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Cole, I don't want you to give up on 
                         her.

                                     COLE
                         I've tried to change her mind.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         It's not her mind you need to change. 
                         It's Disneyland head in there.

                                     COLE
                         But how can I do that?

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         If it were me, I'd reason with him 
                         first. Then, if that failed...
                              (with malice)
                         ...I'd take more persuasive action.

               Mr. T. drills a wicked forehand shot straight at Cole, who 
               swings at it and misses.

                                     COLE
                              (conspiratorily)
                         Thanks for the advise, sir.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Keep me informed.

               PUSH IN ON Cole. This is a man with a plan...

               EXT. PARK ON A BLUFF - DAY

               The bluff overlooks the ocean. It's a beautiful spot. Just 
               the right setting for an outdoor wedding. Some folding chairs 
               have been set up and a canvas canopy.

               Gathered for the rehearsal are Gary, Ryko, Chulo, O'Neill 
               who is with Bobbie, Debbie's mother and Mr. Thomerson, Phoebe, 
               Ilene, Tina, Stan, a gray-haired priest. FATHER FALWELL and, 
               of course, Rick and Debbie. Everyone is admiring this 
               picturesque setting. Everyone but Mr. Thomerson. He's very 
               underjoyed at the sight of Rick and his friends. Mr. and 
               Mrs. Thomerson are standing with Father Falwell. They are 
               watching Rick holding Debbie.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         The thought of that person marrying 
                         my daughter makes me want to upchuck.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         You can tell a man by his friends.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         They're not such a bad bunch.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         No?
                              (he points off)
                         That's his best man peeing on a tree.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               In the b.g. we SEE O'Neill's back TO US. He is definitely 
               relieving himself on a weeping willow. The wind begins to 
               pick up.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         If everyone would take their 
                         positions...

               Everyone takes their places for the wedding procession. The 
               wind now takes this time to blow with much greater force. As 
               Father Falwell opens his Bible, the wind rips the pages out 
               of the Holy Book. They blow to the four corners of the Earth.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                              (continuing)
                         Oh, dear. Well, let's begin. And...

               He hums the Wedding March. Chulo hums along. His humming is 
               a driving Jimi Hendrix-like guitar lick that all but drowns 
               out Father's humming.

               FATHER FALWELL

               He's orchestrating the proceedings.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         Flower Girls... Now Rick...
                              (he gestures for him 
                              to start down the 
                              aisle)
                         Good... Debbie and Mr. Thomerson.

               As he gestures for them to make their walk to him, a gust of 
               wind lifts up Father's cassock, exposing his bare ass. He 
               quickly grabs his cassock and covers himself.

               RICK

               He begins to walk toward the priest. Suddenly, out of nowhere, 
               Cole appears at his side.

                                     RICK
                         Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck 
                         to see the groom before the wedding?

                                     COLE
                         I want Debbie.

                                     RICK
                         Cole...

                                     COLE
                         You dump her and I'll give you cash.

                                     RICK
                         What's Debbie's blue book value right 
                         now?

                                     COLE
                         Five thousand dollars.

                                     RICK
                         No.

               They are now standing near Father Falwell. Debbie is 
               approaching them with Mr. Thomerson. Mr. T. shoots Cole a 
               signal to up the ante.

                                     COLE
                         Seventy-five hundred.

                                     RICK
                         Not interested.

                                     COLE
                         Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster 
                         oven, a Litton microwave, a 
                         Cuisinart...

                                     RICK
                         I'm marrying Debbie.

                                     COLE
                         Michelin tires... brand new. A set 
                         of Sears Best metric tools...

                                     RICK
                              (to O'Neill)
                         What is this person's story here?

                                     O'NEILL
                         The way I see it, the big lug is in 
                         love and he's got a lot of major 
                         appliances lying around.

               Debbie and Mr. T. have joined Rick.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Cole, what are you doing here?

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         He's just trying to save you from 
                         making a mistake.
                              (to Rick)
                         A big mistake.

                                     RICK
                         Thanks, Dad.
                              (to Cole)
                         Cole, go away.

                                     COLE
                         He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll 
                         never be true to you the way I would.

                                     RICK
                         Thank you. We'll all keep that in 
                         mind. 'Bye now.

               Cole turns red with anger.

                                     COLE
                              (pissed)
                         Rick, me and you aren't through yet.

               He runs off.

                                     RICK
                              (a la talk show host)
                         Ladies and gentlemen, Cole Whittier. 
                         Let's hear it for him -- a funny, 
                         funny guy. We love ya, babe.

               The wind suddenly picks up. A storm is coming in off the 
               sea. Father Falwell's cassock blows up again. It starts to 
               rain and hail. Everyone runs for cover but Rick and O'Neill.

                                     RICK
                              (to O'Neill)
                         You think the gods are telling me 
                         something?

               INT. RICK AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Rick is snuggled cozily on his side of the bed, fast asleep. 
               Debbie is staring anxiously at the ceiling. After a couple 
               of beats, she tugs at Rick's shoulder.

                                     RICK
                              (drowsy)
                         Huh? Wha...

                                     DEBBIE
                         I can't sleep.

                                     RICK
                         Oh... I got something for that.

               He groggily reaches into the nightstand, pulls out a hammer. 
               He raises it as if to hit Debbie over the head.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Stop fooling around... I need to 
                         talk.

                                     RICK
                         What's the matter?

                                     DEBBIE
                         I don't know... I just feel scared.

                                     RICK
                              (he sits up)
                         About what?

                                     DEBBIE
                         The wedding, my parents, your family, 
                         our friends, my job, the future, our 
                         relationship, the caterers, my gown, 
                         your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the 
                         apartment, my shower, your bachelor 
                         party...

                                     RICK
                         I think the only think you've left 
                         out are our relations with the Soviet 
                         Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna 
                         be all right.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Before or After I have my nervous 
                         breakfown?

                                     RICK
                         C'mere.

               He starts to gently rub her shoulders. She breathes deeply, 
               trying to let go.

                                     DEBBIE
                         That feels so great.

                                     RICK
                         Good...

                                     DEBBIE
                         Um... that's very relaxing.

                                     RICK
                         Now, I want you to lie down and drift 
                         off to slumberland.

               He slowly lowers her to her pillow and tucks the covers in 
               around her.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         Close your eyes... that's it... 
                         There's nothing to worry about... I 
                         love you... I'm a great guy...
                              (yawning)
                         In two days you're gonna be Mrs. 
                         Great Guy.

               He yawns again and turns off the light on the night table. 
               There is a beat of silence in the dark. We PUSH IN ON their 
               faces, which are faintly illuminated by a street light outside 
               the open window. Both of them have their eyes wide open as 
               they stare at the ceiling in fearful anticipation of the 
               next day.

               INT. AIRPORT - DAY

               The guys (except Gary) are walking through the busy airport.

                                     RYKO
                         You sure Gary's got this whole party 
                         deal together?

                                     CHULO
                         Yeah, man, he's got us a great room 
                         at the hotel and lots of chicks.

                                     RYKO
                         I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a 
                         lot of dinero.

                                     CHULO
                         What time are we supposed to get to 
                         the hotel?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Don't worry, Chulo, the party's not 
                         gonna start without you. We got plenty 
                         of time.

                                     STAN
                         I can't wait to see old Larry... 
                         It's been five years.

                                     RICK
                         At least.

               ANGLE - THE EXIT RAMP

               People are streaming out of the plane. Finally the last person 
               exits.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Where the hell is he?

                                     RICK
                         Knowing Larry, he probably missed 
                         the flight.

                                     STAN
                         There he is... Hey, Larry!

                                     LARRY
                              (talking very slowly)
                         Guys... guys... guys...

                                     RICK
                         'Ludes... 'ludes... 'ludes.

               Larry floats toward them and stops in front of them. He stares 
               at them strangely, looking from face to face.

                                     LARRY
                         God, I love you guys.

               To the guys' surprise, he goes around hugging each one of 
               them.

                                     LARRY
                              (continuing)
                         This makes me so happy.

               They start walking toward the baggage claim area.

                                     O'NEILL
                         So, Larry, how have you been?

                                     LARRY
                         Just in love with everybody. It's 
                         really a beautiful planet. I love 
                         you, Rick. I love you guys. I love 
                         everybody.

                                     RICK
                         So how's your wife?

               Larry stops walking and immediately breaks down.

                                     LARRY
                         I hate her. I hate her guts, the 
                         bitch.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Larry, you and your wife got problems?

                                     LARRY
                         I don't want to talk about it. I 
                         love you guys. I love my friends.

               Larry reaches into his pocket, takes out a Quaalude.

                                     LARRY
                              (continuing)
                         You want to share it?

                                     RICK
                         Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.

                                     LARRY
                         Right.

               He pops it in his mouth.

               EXT. TERMINAL

               The guys exit the Baggage Area. Rick is pushing Larry who is 
               sprawled out on top of his bags in a luggage cart.

                                     LARRY
                         My marriage is the worst. All crap. 
                         A big pile of shit.

                                     RICK
                         Maybe your marriage should lay off 
                         grains for a while.

                                     LARRY
                         She hates me. It's over. You'll see, 
                         as soon as you get married, everything 
                         changes. You sure you want to go 
                         through with it, man?

                                     RICK
                              (his interest peaked)
                         What do you mean, it changes?

               Before Larry can answer they reach the bus where Debbie is 
               waiting for them.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (hugging Larry)
                         Larry, how are you?

                                     LARRY
                         Hi, Debbie, congratulations. Hey, do 
                         you know where there's a pharmacy 
                         around here so I can get a 
                         prescription filled?

                                     RICK
                         Come on, get him on the bus.

               As a couple of the guys pick Larry up and carry him into the 
               bus we

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BUS - DUSK

               Rick is driving the bus with Debbie sitting next to him in 
               the driver's seat. The guys sit in the row of seats behind 
               them.

                                     RICK
                         Well... twenty-four more hours to go 
                         and tonight we'll share with our 
                         friends and loved ones the joys of 
                         those last moments of singleness.

                                     DEBBIE
                         You better not have too much joy.

                                     RICK
                         Wouldn't think of it. Because 
                         tomorrow...
                              (starts singing)
                         We're going to the chapel and we're...

                                     DEBBIE
                              (singing)
                         Gonna get married...

               ANGLE - THE GUYS

               They start to join in the song in a little less than perfect 
               harmony.

                                     EVERYBODY
                         Going to the chapel and we're gonna 
                         get married.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Gee, I really love you...

                                     RICK
                         And we're gonna get ma-a-a-ried.

                                     EVERYBODY
                              (whooping it up)
                         Going to the chapel of love.

                                     RICK
                         Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah.

               EXT. BUS

               The bus zooms down the street.

                                     EVERYBODY (V.O.)
                         Going to the chapel of love.

               EXT. THOMERSON'S - DUSK

               Rick's bus comes up to the driveway in front of the house 
               and stops.

               INT. RICK'S BUS - DUSK

                                     RICK
                         This is it, lady. Last stop.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Can't I just go with you guys?

                                     RICK
                         Sorry, we got men's business to do. 
                         It's no place for a lady.

               He opens the door, picks Debbie up and carries her out to 
               the sidewalk.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Remember, you promised... no screwing 
                         around.

                                     RICK
                         Did I promise that? I don't remember 
                         that...

                                     DEBBIE
                         You're really pissing me off.

               She grabs Rick and wraps her arm around him in a playful 
               headlock.

                                     RICK
                         Okay, I promise... I swear on my 
                         mother's grave.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Your mother's not dead.

                                     RICK
                         Well, if I go back on my word, I'll 
                         kill her.

               Debbie lets go of his neck.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Have a good time. Don't make it too 
                         late.

                                     RICK
                         Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun 
                         shower. Use soap.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I love you.

               They kiss, and the guys whistle in the background. Then Debbie 
               starts toward the house and Rick hops back into the bus. He 
               gets into the seat and sits there for a moment, watching 
               Debbie with a guilty look as she goes into the house.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (to Rick)
                         What's the matter?

                                     RICK
                              (snapping out of it)
                         Nothing... Let's get crazy!

                                     RYKO
                         All right!

                                     CHULO
                         When do the girls get to the party?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Don't worry, Gary's taking care of 
                         that now.

               The guys holler and whoop it up as Rick puts the bus in gear 
               and takes off down the street.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. GRIMY STREET CORNER - EVENING

               JUMBO, a well-dressed behemoth in a sky blue suit and 
               widebrimmed hat, is standing on a street corner talking to 
               Gary.

                                     GARY
                         So we want your best girls, the cream 
                         of your crop.

                                     JUMBO
                         Let's see your bread.

               Gary takes out a roll of bills, which Jumbo grabs and quickly 
               counts.

                                     JUMBO
                              (continuing)
                         Okay, I got just what you're looking 
                         for.
                              (calling off)
                         Margot... Darlene...

               Two shapely HOOKERS in tight-fitting clothes come up to them.

                                     GARY
                         They'll do just fine. Hiya, girls. 
                         Look, after the orgy, maybe we could 
                         have coffee.

               The girls look at him with "Is he for real?" in their eyes.

                                     JUMBO
                         Shorty, where's the party?

               Gary takes some slips of paper out of his pocket and hands 
               Jumbo one.

                                     GARY
                         Park View Hotel, Room 1002.

                                     JUMBO
                         They'll be up there in a half hour.

                                     GARY
                         Okay. Nice to meet you both.

               Gary turns, almost collides with a garbage can, and starts 
               walking down the street. He passes a parked Porsche. After a 
               beat, Cole Whittier sticks his head up and watches Gary walk 
               off. Then he hops out of his car and approaches Jumbo and 
               the girls.

                                     COLE
                         Hi. I must have just missed my friend. 
                         He hired you for a bachelor party.

                                     JUMBO
                         At the Park View Hotel, Room 1002. 
                         What about it.

               Cole's face lights up. This is the information he needed.

                                     COLE
                         Yeah. Right.
                              (takes out piece of 
                              paper)
                         This is the new address. We changed 
                         our minds and decided to send the 
                         girls over to his house instead.

               He takes out a fifty-dollar bill.

                                     COLE
                              (continuing)
                         And here's a fifty... I want this to 
                         be a surprise, so you never saw me, 
                         okay?

                                     JUMBO
                              (pocketing the money)
                         No problem.

               Cole smiles happily as he slithers back to his car.

                                     COLE
                              (to himself)
                         Now she'll see what kind of jackoff 
                         he is.

               ANGLE - HOTEL

               A parking VALET crosses to the bus as Rick hands him the 
               keys.

                                     RICK
                         Be careful with it. It's a rental.

               The guys hop out with the enthusiasm of a home team that's 
               just won the state championship. They race in the front door. 
               A banner over the door reads: "WELCOME MISS MOOSEHEAD BEER 
               PAGEANT."

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

               This is a pretty plush place. The kind of hotel that prides 
               itself on its classy image. The guys are totally unaware of 
               the sedate atmosphere in the lobby as they go screaming toward 
               the elevators.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (to some dignified 
                              guests)
                         We who are about to go ape shit salute 
                         you.

                                     RYKO
                         All right, I'm stoked!

               Just as they are about to get into the elevator, a hand comes 
               INTO FRAME and holds the door so it will not close.

               WIDEN TO INCLUDE the MANAGER. All their carrying-on stops 
               when the guys see him staring grimly at them. If he wasn't a 
               hotel manager, he'd be a mortician. He has a constant 
               expression on his face that suggests he's constantly sucking 
               lemons.

                                     MANAGER
                         Just where do you guys think you 
                         are?

                                     O'NEILL
                         The Library of Congress?

                                     CHULO
                         Detroit?

                                     LARRY
                         Beyond the sun?

                                     RICK
                         Are any of those right?

                                     MANAGER
                         This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the 
                         Hotel Manager. Are you looking for 
                         someone?

                                     RICK
                         Yes, you. We're looking for our 
                         room... 1002.

               Rick takes out his key.

                                     MANAGER
                         It's on the tenth floor.

                                     RICK
                         What do you know, they moved it. 
                         Catch you later.

               The door starts to close and the guys start yelling.

                                     MANAGER
                         Keep your voices down. This is a 
                         respectable establishment. We don't 
                         go for any funny business here. Just 
                         then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat 
                         and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass 
                         him and enter the elevator with the 
                         boys.

                                     RICK
                         I see what you mean... You're a 
                         beautiful guy. And you're doing a 
                         damn good job.

               The door slams shut before the Manager can say anything else.

               INT. THE THOMERSON'S - NIGHT

               Several of Debbie's friends have arrived and are chatting 
               amiably in the living room. Phoebe is dipping potato chips 
               into a bowl that says "Muffy" on it.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Do you have any more of this dip, 
                         Mrs. Thomerson? It's really excellent.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         You just ate Purina Cat Chow.

                                     PHOEBE
                         Gross me out...

               Debbie comes into the living room and sits next to Bobbie.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (concerned)
                         What do you think's gonna go on at 
                         the guys' party?

                                     BOBBIE
                         They'll probably get drunk, and watch 
                         dirty movies. But don't worry about 
                         the dirty movies.

                                     DEBBIE
                         What do you mean?

                                     BOBBIE
                         I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I 
                         found a bunch of pornos in the back 
                         seat of O'Neill's car.

                                     DEBBIE
                         You're kidding.

                                     BOBBIE
                         Nah. Everything's cool... I took 
                         care of 'em.
                              (starts to giggle)

               EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Rick, Ryko, O'Neill, Chulo, Larry and Stan are walking down 
               the hallway, looking for their room.

                                     O'NEILL
                         1004, 1003...
                              (spots the room)
                         Aha! 1002.

               The guys give out a hearty cheer as they huddle around the 
               door. O'Neill grabs the doorknob. He takes his time, playing 
               up the moment.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         And now...

               The guys lean forward, anticipating the opening of the gates 
               of heaven.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         ...to our honored guest Rick, and 
                         his life-long friends, I say...
                              (turns the doorknob)
                         ...gentlemen, start your boners.

               He flings open the door and everyone but he and Rick burst 
               into the room.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

               The guys all but dive into the room. It is a two-room suite 
               with living room/kitcheonette and separate bedroom. The room 
               has been decorated with balloons. A sign reads: "Happy 
               Bachelor Party!" It looks far from professionally decorated. 
               Chulo frantically checks out the rooms.

                                     RYKO
                         Bitchin' place.

               He hangs a chin-up bar in a doorway and starts to chin 
               himself.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I did the balloons myself.

               He takes a prophylactic out of a Trojan carton. He blows it 
               up. On closer examination, we SEE all the balloons are 
               inflated prophylactics.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Chulo returns from his search of the rooms.

                                     CHULO
                              (crazed)
                         Where's the women, man? We gotta 
                         have women.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Chulo, one thing at a time.

                                     CHULO
                         Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.

                                     STAN
                         What's first?

                                     O'NEILL
                         A bit of a warm-up.

               He threads a film projector.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos 
                         Without Pants"...

                                     RICK
                         Olivier's in that, right?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Then it's on to the real thing.

                                     GUYS
                              (cheering)
                         All right!

               Ryko flips off the lights as O'Neill puts the projector into 
               forward and the title flashes on a movie screen. All the 
               guys yell in anticipation.

               HOME MOVIE SCREEN

               We SEE a man stepping out of a shower. He puts on his robe 
               and exits the bathroom. To his surprise and to the delight 
               of our guys, two young, beautiful Nordic looking women, 
               dressed in micro-minis and see-through blouses stand waiting 
               for him.

                                     CHULO (O.S.)
                         They're Danish, I know it. I'm crazy 
                         for Danes.

               RYKO AND CHULO

               sit watching the screen.

                                     RYKO
                              (to Chulo)
                         Denmark makes great Nautilus 
                         equipment.

                                     CHULO
                         I'd like to jerk and press those 
                         babies.

               RICK AND O'NEILL

                                     RICK
                              (to O'Neill)
                         And I thought we wouldn't have any 
                         meaningful conversation.

               ON SCREEN

               The man takes off his robe. The girls start to seductively 
               undress.

                                     GUYS (O.S.)
                              (excitedly)
                         All right, yeah, yeah, yeah...

               Suddenly an abrupt jump cut. The girls are undressed and 
               lying on top of the man. Our guys are seriously let down.

               GUYS

                                     EVERYONE
                              (disappointed)
                         Awwww...

               O'NEILL

               He can't figure it out.

               ON THE SCREEN

               As the women kiss the man from his head slowly down his chest, 
               past his navel and heading south...

               GUYS

               Their eyes start to widen like a child in a Keene painting.

                                     GUYS
                         Yes, go, go, yes, go...

               ON THE SCREEN

               Another abrupt jump cut spliced together with what looks 
               like a band-aid, and the girls are sitting on the side of 
               the bed. The man is recovering from the best sex he's ever 
               encountered.

               GUYS

                                     GUYS
                              (disappointed)
                         Awwwwww...

               Rick turns to a shocked O'Neill.

                                     RICK
                         Excuse me, but this is as arousing 
                         as a stroll through the Vatican.

                                     O'NEILL
                         This isn't right.

               GUYS' POV

               They watch the screen. The two women seem to be taking a 
               liking to each other. They begin to fall onto the bed and 
               entwine.

                                     GUYS
                         Please, yes, do it, yes, yes, oh 
                         yes...

               A jump cut and they are dressing. Stan can't take it anymore. 
               He jumps to his feet.

                                     STAN
                         Where are the dirty parts? I'm a 
                         doctor. I can see these things.

                                     CHULO
                         What a waste of two women.

               O'Neill rises abruptly.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I don't get it, but at least Gary's 
                         got the real stuff coming up here in 
                         a few minutes.

                                     CHULO
                              (in ecstasy)
                         Women!

               Everyone cheers.

               INT. THOMERSON HOUSE

               The girls are having a great time. The front DOORBELL RINGS. 
               Mrs. Thomerson answers it. Standing in the doorway is Tina 
               Stahl, Stan's wife; she's late for the shower. Behind her 
               are two obvious hookers: Margot and Darlene. Tina doesn't 
               know either of the girls.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         Yes?

               Before Tina can speak, Margot speaks up. She's reading from 
               the piece of paper Cole gave her.

                                     MARGOT
                              (through heavy gum 
                              chewing)
                         Yeah, hi. Look, is this...

               INSERT - PIECE OF PAPER

               Margot reads the address.

                                     MARGOT (O.S.)
                         838 North Franek Avenue?

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         Yes.

                                     MARGOT
                         We're here.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         How nice.

                                     TINA
                         I'm Tina Stahl.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         Of course. Stan's wife... Everyone 
                         come in.

               REVERSE ANGLE - THE STREET

               Cole sits in his car and watches happily as the hookers go 
               inside.

               INT. THOMERSON'S LIVING ROOM

               Debbie spots Tina. She is oblivious to the two hookers.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Tina!

               They give each other a big hug. The hookers watch closely. 
               Debbie leads Tina to the other women.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (continuing)
                         You know everyone here, don't you?

                                     TINA
                         Yes.

               The girls hug and give big hellos. Meanwhile, Margot and 
               Darlene have come to the conclusion they've been hired for a 
               kinky scene.

                                     MARGOT
                         One of these, huh?

                                     DARLENE
                         Looks that way.

                                     MARGOT
                         Buck's a buck.

               They start to unbutton their coats.

               Tina hands Debbie her present.

                                     DEBBIE
                         It's so heavy.

               She sits and the girls gather around as she starts to open 
               the gift.

               Phoebe happens to look off and is stunned by what she sees. 
               The others are curious at what she is looking at and they 
               too stare O.S., stunned to silence.

               MARGOT AND DARLENE

               dressed in leather and mesh stockings. Margot carries a whip. 
               Darlene is holding a phallic electrical device.

                                     DARLENE
                              (business-like)
                         Is there an empty outlet in here?

               Debbie unconsciously points to a nearby wall. Margot and 
               Darlene stand amidst the girls. Darlene plugs in her device. 
               She and Margot start to embrace and fondle one another. The 
               girls watch in stony silence. Dumbfounded at what they see. 
               Margot and Darlene start to sink to the floor, OUT OF OUR 
               SIGHT. Before they disappear, we see Margot take out her gum 
               and park it on an end table. Now OUT OF SIGHT, the girls 
               watch for a beat. Then we hear the WHIRRING of Darlene's 
               implement. Our girls screech in horror and hold onto one 
               another in a protective clump.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               The guys are sitting around drinking, eating and looking 
               generally bored. Chulo sits in front of the TV, glumly 
               watching an old "I Love Lucy" re-run.

                                     CHULO
                         If I was Ricky Ricardo I would beat 
                         the shit out of that chick.

                                     LARRY
                              (totally ripped, 
                              staring at the black 
                              and white image)
                         Wow! The colors are sooo beautiful.

               Chulo gives him a strange look.

                                     RYKO
                              (opening a beer, 
                              reading the label)
                         Isn't there any beer that's not 
                         imported? All this stuff's from St. 
                         Louis.

                                     RICK
                              (calling to imaginary 
                              person O.S.)
                         Bartender, round of brains for my 
                         friend here.

               Gary enters the room. He's all smiles. Confident he's done a 
               great job arranging for the entertainment.

                                     GARY
                         How's it going, guys?

               Everyone crowds around him like children greeting Daddy. 
               Looking for candy hidden in his coat.

                                     EVERYONE
                         Where's the girls? Where's the girls?

               Rick pushes them away from Gary like a referee separating 
               two fighters.

                                     RICK
                         Give the guy air. Everyone to a 
                         neutral corner.

                                     GARY
                         What's going on?

                                     CHULO
                         Nothing. We got no women.

                                     GARY
                         Screw you.

                                     RICK
                         It's true.

                                     GARY
                         This place should have been wall to 
                         wall tits by now.

                                     RICK
                              (to O'Neill)
                         Guy paints a beautiful picture.

                                     GARY
                         I'm going to see what the hell 
                         happened.

                                     RICK
                         Looks like the only one who got 
                         screwed here was you.

                                     GARY
                         Screw that.

               He exits out the door.

                                     O'NEILL
                         So, what do you guys think of the 
                         party so far?

               The guys toss sandwiches and empty beer cans at him.

                                     RICK
                              (putting his arm around 
                              O'Neill)
                         Well, I think you've done a damn 
                         fine job.

               Everyone pelts Rick and O'Neill with more junk.

               Suddenly the door bursts open. The guys look up and are 
               surprised to see Cole enter.

                                     COLE
                         Rick, I want to talk to you.

                                     RICK
                         Ah, Cole.
                              (turns to the others)
                         I don't remember ordering an asshole 
                         from room service.

               Cole enters, closing the door behind him.

                                     COLE
                         I don't want any trouble.

                                     RICK
                         Oh, come on, just a little.

                                     COLE
                         I'm ready to make you another deal.

                                     RICK
                              (mock excitement)
                         Ooh, be still, my heart.

                                     COLE
                              (points out window)
                         See that down there? That's my most 
                         prized possession. My new Porsche.

               RICK'S POV

               Cole's Porsche parked in the hotel parking lot.

                                     RICK (O.S.)
                         Very nice...

               BACK TO SCENE

               Rick gestures to Chulo to look out the window.

                                     RICK
                              (his voice tells us 
                              he has something in 
                              mind)
                         Isn't that a great car, Chulo?

               Chulo gets Rick's drift.

                                     CHULO
                         Yeah... real nice. Ah, excuse me. 
                         I'll be right back.

               He starts to exit. Before he does, he grabs a hanger out of 
               the closet.

                                     COLE
                         Great car.

                                     RICK
                         The best.

                                     COLE
                         I love that car.

                                     RICK
                         I'm very happy for you two.

               They back away from the window.

                                     COLE
                         I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. 
                         An even swap.

                                     RICK
                              (surprised)
                         The car for Debbie?

                                     COLE
                              (getting a little 
                              excitable)
                         I mean it. The car is yours. Dump 
                         Debbie.

                                     RICK
                         Gee, guys, what should I do? The car 
                         or Debbie?

               All the guys treat this as if it's "Let's Make A Deal". They 
               take sides, yelling out, "Take the car," "Keep Debbie." Over 
               the din we hear a befuddled Rick.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         What a decision here.

               He walks over to the window. Cole follows closely. He's trying 
               to convince Rick to take the car.

                                     COLE
                         Low mileage... Handles like a dream.

                                     RICK
                         So does Debbie.

               EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Chulo is using the hanger to jimmy the car lock on Cole's 
               Porsche. He's successful. He jumps into the car and drives 
               off.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Rick and Cole are at the window. The guys are still trying 
               to convince Rick on his decision.

                                     COLE
                         I got the car only two months ago -- 
                         it's got --

               As he looks out the window we see with him that his car is 
               gone.

                                     COLE
                              (continuing)
                         Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's 
                         gone!

                                     RICK
                         Maybe it had something to do.

                                     COLE
                         Shit!

               He charges out of the room.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Odd. He's only been gone a few seconds 
                         and I already miss him.

               EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

               Gary spots Jumbo on the same grimy street corner. He's pimping 
               for one of his ladies and makes a sale to an anxious young 
               Marine as Gary approaches him.

                                     GARY
                         Jumbo, where the hell are the women?

                                     JUMBO
                         What are you talking about, asshole?

                                     GARY
                         Your whores never showed up.

                                     JUMBO
                         They left an hour ago, pink nuts.

                                     GARY
                         Screw you!

               Jumbo has had enough. He backs Gary against a wall and pulls 
               a knife on him.

                                     JUMBO
                              (irritated; a lot)
                         That's it, prick lips.

                                     GARY
                         What are you...

                                     JUMBO
                         I've had it, numb nuts... How much 
                         money you got?

                                     GARY
                         Why?

                                     JUMBO
                         Because I'm pissed off. Now give me 
                         your cash.

               Gary hurriedly digs into his pockets and gives Jumbo his 
               money.

                                     GARY
                         This is bad public relations. I was 
                         planning to do a lot of business 
                         with you. But now I'm going to have 
                         to go elsewhere.

                                     JUMBO
                              (mock sincerity)
                         Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll 
                         give you girls.

               He snaps his fingers and TWO of his LADIES come forward.

                                     JUMBO
                              (continuing; to girls)
                         Give him the works.

                                     GARY
                         That's more like it.

               The girls walk over to Gary and proceed to beat the crap out 
               of him.

               EXT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT

               It is a garish nightclub. A large lighted billboard proclaims 
               "ALL MALE... ALL NUDE." Two cars pull into the parking lot. 
               Debbie and all of her shower guests get out.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Are you sure this is a good idea?

                                     ILENE
                         Look, you heard what those hookers 
                         said. They were supposed to go to a 
                         bachelor party.

                                     DEBBIE
                         That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.

                                     ILENE
                         Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can 
                         have women, we can have men.

                                     BOBBIE
                              (agreeing)
                         Yeah.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                              (reluctantly)
                         I don't know about this.

                                     DEBBIE
                         C'mon, Mother, it'll be fun.

               The girls giggle as they enter the place, with Mrs. Thomerson 
               following reluctantly behind.

               INT. CHIPPENDALE'S - NIGHT

                         Look at that guy. What a hunk.

                                     BOBBIE
                         Check out the other guy's buns.

                         Let's sit over here.

               They head for some empty tables. Debbie notices her mother 
               is still standing transfixed by the MAN on display on stage. 
               Debbie grabs her by the shoulder.

                                     DEBBIE
                         C'mon, Mom.

               On the way to the table they pass MICHAEL, the bartender, 
               who looks at them and immediately recognizes Debbie. Finding 
               this interesting, he picks up a phone and dials.

                                     MICHAEL
                              (softly; into phone)
                         Yes... is there a Rick Stahl 
                         registered there?

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Gary, beaten up, his clothes ripped, stands amidst the guys.

                                     RICK
                         Hookers beat you up?

                                     GARY
                         Yes.

                         I didn't know you were into that.

                         How could you be so stupid. I'm gonna 
                         kill you.

                                     GARY
                         Go ahead, but if you want women, we 
                         need more money.

                         This just isn't righteous.

                              Gary)
                         Help this person help others get 
                         laid. Give till it hurts. He needs 
                         you.

               The guys take out money. Larry stands and digs into his pocket 
               for his wallet. Along with the wallet comes dozens of pills.

               Rick picks up the receiver.

               He's standing behind the bar.

                         we'll be right down. I want to check 
                         this out.

               He hangs up the phone. Gary, meantime, has collected his

               As Larry slumps on the couch, the guys exit.

               Rick and the guys exit the hotel. As they exit, Mr. Thomerson 
               enters. Both parties are oblivious to the other's presence.

               Mr. Thomerson is greeted by a Moosehead Beer EXECUTIVE who

                         over at the last minute and judge 
                         our little beauty pageant.

                         tell them where I am.

               He enters a phone booth and starts to dial.

                         tonight. The wife is throwing a bridal 
                         shower for my daughter.
                              (into phone)
                         This is Ed Thomerson. Please transfer 
                         my calls to...
                              (reading number off 
                              phone)
                         220-1892. Right.

               He crosses with executive toward the ballroom.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Congratulations on your daughter's 
                         wedding. Who's she marrying?

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         A real turd.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                              (at a loss for words)
                         Well... hope she'll be very happy.

               They exit into ballroom.

               INT. CHIPPENDALE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Amidst the kitchen activities we SEE Rick, O'Neill, Ryko, 
               Stan, and Michael.

                                     RICK
                         So will your friend Nick do it?

                                     MICHAEL
                         He'll do anything for money.

                                     RICK
                         I love his attitude.
                              (calling off)
                         They still out there?

               STAN

               He's peeking through the kitchen door. We SEE Debbie and the 
               shower girls whooping it up at a ringside table. Stan turns 
               back to Rick.

                                     STAN
                         Breathing heavy at ringside.

               He joins the other guys.

                                     RICK
                              (a la Long John Silver)
                         So, they want action, eh? Are you 
                         with me, me hardies?

               The guys shout approval as NICK, one of the male dancers, 
               enters carrying a tray of food. Nick is a muscled hunk.

                                     MICHAEL
                         Guys, this is Chippendale's star 
                         attraction, Nicholas Carter... better 
                         known as Nick the Dick.

                                     RYKO
                         Nick the what?

               Nick drops his pants. Since he's being SHOT only from the 
               WAIST UP, we can't see what the guys see.

                                     NICK
                              (proudly)
                         The Dick.

                                     ALL OUR GUYS
                              (astonished at this 
                              O.S. sight)
                         Jesus Christ!

                                     RICK
                         Let's get this thing going. Tray, 
                         please.

               Nick holds the tray waist high. Rick arranges the food.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         Looks good. Can I have the bun, 
                         Michael?

               Michael hands Rick a hot dog bun. Rick places it on the tray. 
               He turns to Nick.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         And now, Nick... or is it Mr. Dick?

                                     NICK
                         Nick.

                                     RICK
                         Nick, if you would be so kind...

               NICK

               He holds the tray with one hand. With the other he reaches 
               OUT OF FRAME. In a nutshell, what he does is place his honker 
               in the hot dog bun. As he slaps his business into the bun, 
               we HEAR a solid THUMP.

                                     RICK
                         Nick, the rest is all yours.

                                     NICK
                              (excusing himself)
                         Gentlemen.

               He exits. As he does, our guys crowd around and peek through 
               the kitchen door.

               NICK

               We FOLLOW him as he approaches the girls' table.

                                     NICK
                         If you ladies would like to serve 
                         yourselves...

               The girls grab their orders. Mrs. T. is last. Hers is the 
               hot dog. She points to it.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         Is this the foot long?

                                     NICK
                         And then some.

               Mrs. T. grabs the hot dog. It won't come off the tray. She 
               yanks harder. Nick drops the tray and Mrs. T. finally comes 
               to realize what she is pulling on. She screams in terror. 
               Because of sheer fright, she can't seem to drop Nick's schlong 
               from her grip. The rest of our ladies look to see Mrs. T. 's 
               hot dog. They scream in shock. Debbie spits out her 
               marguerita, hitting Phoebe in the face.

               OUR GUYS

               They are busting a gut watching the girls' reactions.

                                     ILENE
                         She looks up just in time to see the 
                         guys close the kitchen door.

               MRS. T

               still frozen in a state of shock. The girls try to pry her 
               hands off.

               EXT. STREET CORNER

               Several HOOKERS are standing around. Gary approaches them.

                                     GARY
                         Ladies... come here.

                                     HOOKER
                         Talk to the pimp.

               She gestures to a MAN with his back TO US.

                                     GARY
                         Let's talk.

               The PIMP turns around and we SEE he is the stereotypical 
               pimp. One big difference: he's an Indian straight from the 
               streets of Calcutta. He's soft-spoken and ever smiling and 
               he still hasn't quite mastered English.

                                     RAJAH
                              (oh-so-heavy Indian 
                              accent)
                         What can I be doing for you?

                                     GARY
                         You're a pimp?

                                     RAJAH
                         I'm telling you I am, Joe.

                                     GARY
                         I want women.

                                     RAJAH
                         That I got. Very good women. They 
                         sit on your face, anything you want.

                                     GARY
                         I'll take some.

                                     RAJAH
                         Big problem now. Soon they go to 
                         customers.

                                     GARY
                         I need them for a bachelor party at 
                         the Park View Hotel.

                                     RAJAH
                         You are being in luck. Customers in 
                         same hotel. I let you have them at 
                         cut-rate price for 45 minutes.

                                     GARY
                         Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.

                                     RAJAH
                         Not one minute longer or Milt will 
                         come for you.

                                     GARY
                         Milt?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               MILT joins them. Milt is a massive hulk. A bearded exbiker. 
               He could have come out of an MX silo. A menacing mountain of 
               a man decked out in a cowboy hat.

                                     RAJAH
                         This being Milt.

               Milt casually takes off his hat and immediately sticks his 
               face through a nearby window, smashing it to pieces. He pulls 
               his head out, smiles and puts his hat back on.

                                     RAJAH
                              (continuing)
                         Girls back in 45 minutes or Milt 
                         cuts your balls off. Fair enough? 
                         Shake!

               Gary extends his hand and they shake.

                                     GARY
                              (to himself as he 
                              walks to his car)
                         I just bet my balls and shook on it.

               EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               The guys are piling back out of the bus into the hotel. The 
               Manager watches them suspiciously.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Rick, O'Neill, Ryko and Stan come back into the room.

                                     RICK
                              (concerned; calling 
                              O.S.)
                         Larry! Yo, Larry.

               Rick crosses to the bathroom door, opens it and goes in.

               RICK'S POV

               Larry is on his knees on the side of the tub with his head 
               submerged fully under several inches of water.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         What are you doing?

               Larry comes out of the water. He gasps for breath and speaks.

                                     LARRY
                         I'm killing myself.

               He takes a deep breath and submerges his head again. Rick 
               unplugs the tub and it begins to drain.

                                     RICK
                         Larry... you've got to lighten up. 
                         You and the wife can work it out.

               The water has drained from the tub, leaving Larry high and 
               dry. He lifts his head out of the tub. In his state, he's 
               unaware that the water is gone. He gasps for air as Rick 
               holds him up.

                                     RICK
                         Lar... sometimes when people are mad 
                         they say things they don't mean.

                                     LARRY
                         No, she hates me... I want to end 
                         everything here... now.

               Larry takes a deep breath and plunges his head into the tub. 
               His head hits the waterless tub bottom with a loud THUD. He 
               goes limp from the concussion. His body drapes into the tub, 
               head first.

                                     RICK
                         You okay?

                                     LARRY
                         Yeah, I guess so.

                                     RICK
                         Really?

                                     LARRY
                         Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, 
                         let's party.

               Larry gets up and exits the room. PUSH IN ON Rick. He looks 
               after Larry, concerned.

                                     RICK
                              (to himself)
                         He ain't all right.

               ANGLE - THE LOBBY

               Cole sits in a phone booth holding the receiver impatiently.

               ANGLE WIDENS TO REVEAL THE ADJOINING PHONE BOOTH

               The receiver is off the hook. After a beat, Mr. T. crosses 
               to the phone. Cole does not see him, and vice versa.

                                     MR. T
                         Hello?

                                     COLE
                         Mr. Thomerson.

                                     MR. T
                         Yes, son, did you find out where the 
                         bachelor party is?

                                     COLE
                         Yes I did.

                                     MR. T
                         Fine. How's everything going?

                                     COLE
                         Not so good. He wouldn't listen to 
                         reason. He stole my car... my 
                         Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         So, he's playing hard ball. Well, 
                         two can play that game.
                              (yelling)
                         Go after him. Stop at nothing. You 
                         hear me?

                                     COLE
                         What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear 
                         you.

               Looking over into the next booth, he sees Thomerson's back.

                                     COLE
                              (continuing)
                         Some fat slob in the next booth is 
                         making a lot of noise.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Well, tell the asshole to shut up.

                                     COLE
                         Right.
                              (calling off)
                         Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin 
                         head's yelling...
                              (yelling O.S.)
                         Shut up, I'm talking here.
                              (into phone)
                         Now look, I want you to go back and 
                         I don't care what you do. Stop that 
                         marriage.

               He slams the phone down and EXITS SCREEN RIGHT. Cole starts 
               to exit left when he spots Chulo getting into the elevator.

                                     CHULO
                         Hey, man, your car's looking good.

                                     COLE
                              (crazed)
                         Where is it?

                                     CHULO
                         Out front.

               The elevator doors slam shut. Cole races out into the street.

               EXT. HOTEL

               Cole comes bursting out into the street. We can tell by his 
               shocked expression he doesn't like what he sees.

                                     COLE
                         Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

               CAMERA PANS as he charges to his Porsche. His pride and joy 
               has now, thanks to Chulo, been customized into a Chicano 
               special. It's chopped and channeled; dingleberries rim the 
               back window, flames have been painted on the rear fender; a 
               chain steering wheel, fuzzy dashboard, dice hanging from the 
               mirror. A real East L.A. beauty.

               ANGLE - COLE

               He's snapped -- totally flipped. He turns and yells up to 
               the hotel:

                                     COLE
                              (screaming)
                         Rick... Rick... Goddamn it.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - ANGLE - RICK

               He's standing near the window.

                                     RICK
                         Gee. I think that's for me.

               He looks out the window and sees Cole standing next to his 
               transformed Porsche.

                                     COLE
                         Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always 
                         be.

                                     RICK
                              (yelling back)
                         Cole, when was the last time you had 
                         a lobotomy?

                                     COLE
                              (furious)
                         You've had it. I'm gonna get you.

               ANGLE - THE STREET

               Cole hops in his car and drives off, blowing his HORN at 
               oncoming traffic. The HORN PLAYS "LA CUCURACHA." Cole slams 
               his fist on the steering wheel in disgust.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

                                     RICK
                              (to guys)
                         Don't you love it when old friends 
                         stop by?

                                     O'NEILL
                              (to Rick)
                         Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get 
                         something to eat. We'll bring back 
                         food for everybody.

                                     RICK
                         I'm not really hungry.

                                     O'NEILL
                         C'mon. I insist.

               He grabs Rick by the arm and leads him out of the room.

               INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT

               Rick is finishing giving the food order to a WAITER. In the 
               b.g. we SEE O'Neill talking to a BELLHOP. The Bellhop is 
               pointing to a table. O'Neill thanks him and slips him some 
               money.

                                     RICK
                         ...couple more on rye. Lots of 
                         fries... and a burger and diet soda.

               Waiter acknowledges he's got it and exits. O'Neill joins 
               Rick.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Let's sit down.

               O'Neill leads Rick to the table the Bellhop pointed out. 
               They sit down. Immediately O'Neill takes some cash from his 
               pocket and holds it under the table.

               ANGLE UNDER THE TABLE

               Huddled underneath the table, hidden by the tablecloth, is a 
               HOOKER. Her specialty is coming right up. She grabs the bills 
               from O'Neill's hand. She tucks the money in her cleavage and 
               turns her talents to Rick. She unzips his fly.

               RICK

               He reacts to the ZIP SOUND.

                                     RICK
                         What the hell is that?

                                     O'NEILL
                         My gift to you.

                                     RICK
                         Under the table!

                                     O'NEILL
                         The best table in the house.

               The Hooker has begun to do what she does best. And Rick loves 
               it.

                                     RICK
                         ...I think we can skip the wine list. 
                         Oh, gee...

               FATHER FALWELL

               enters the restaurant. He spots Rick and O'Neill and crosses 
               to them.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         Boys, good evening to you.

               Rick tries to maintain his dignity. But from under the table 
               a blue ribbon job is being applied to his fun zone.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Father Falwell, good evening.

               Falwell shakes Rick's hand. Rick hangs on for dear life. 
               Pumping the hand up and down at a faster and faster rate.

                                     RICK
                         Father... Oh, yes... yes... yesssss... 
                         Oh, yesssssss!

               Falwell pries his hand loose.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         So, Rick, soon you will be a married 
                         man. How does it feel?

                                     RICK
                         Innnnnn-credible!

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         Well, nice seeing you both.

               Rick's excitement heightens as the Hooker pulls out all stops.

                                     RICK
                         Ooooooooh, Jesus, Oh God, God, God, 
                         God, Oh Jesus, Jeeeesussss...

               Father Falwell looks on rather perplexed. Rick sees Falwell's 
               puzzled look.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         I was just saying grace.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         How nice.

                                     O'NEILL
                         You done?

               Before Rick can speak we HEAR a VOICE from under the table.

                                     HOOKER (O.S.)
                         Not yet.

               Rick's hand EXITS FRAME and zips up his pants. Then Rick and 
               O'Neill get up.

                                     RICK
                         Father, would you like to take our 
                         table?

               O'Neill can't believe what Rick is about to do.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         Yes. Thank you.

               He sits in Rick's spot. Rick leans on the table to say his 
               final farewell to the priest. He takes this moment to get 
               some money out of his pocket and hold it under the table.

               UNDER THE TABLE

               The Hooker grabs the money.

               BACK TO SCENE

                                     RICK
                         I think you'll enjoy this table.

                                     O'NEILL
                         So long, Father.

               He and Rick, suppressing a laugh, exit. Father Falwell picks 
               up the menu. We HEAR the ZIP SOUND. Father perks up. He 
               doesn't know what the hell is happening.

               O'Neill turns to Rick as they're leaving the coffee shop.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I don't get it. Why didn't you go 
                         for it just now?

                                     RICK
                         I don't know. Maybe it's because I 
                         love Debbie or maybe it's hard for 
                         me to get off in a place that smells 
                         like egg salad. I'm not sure.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Rick and O'Neill enter the suite. No one is there.

                                     RICK
                         Where the hell is everybody?

               Everyone jumps out from their hiding places. With our guys 
               is Gary and his team of FIVE PROSTITUTES.

                                     GARY
                         Surprise!
                              (gesturing to the 
                              girls)
                         The team bus just pulled in.

                                     STAN
                         Hookers. It's a party!

                                     RICK
                         All right!

               One of our hookers, KELLEY, gets everyone's attention.

                                     KELLEY
                         Who's first, guys?

               Everyone acts as if they're in grade school. They raise their 
               hands; they come on like kids trying to get the teacher's 
               attention.

                                     GUYS
                         Oh, me... me... me!

                                     O'NEILL
                         Wait. The guest of honor should be 
                         first.

                                     RICK
                         Nah, that's okay. My brother has to 
                         look up old people's asses all day 
                         long. Let's give him a break.

                                     STAN
                         Right. Give me the will to live. Let 
                         me go first.

                                     O'NEILL
                         A moving plea. Okay, Doc, you lead 
                         off. I'll screw clean up.

               Everyone cheers Stan's good fortune. Kelley takes Stan by 
               the hand and leads him into the bedroom. Gary turns on a 
               record and everyone starts dancing. Larry is laying out drugs 
               on a table. They consist of lines of coke and various happy 
               time pills of all colors and shapes. Rick takes a look at 
               the layout.

                                     RICK
                         How thoughtful. A drug smorgasbord.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Chulo enters. He sees the party has taken off.

                                     CHULO
                         I have returned!

               He spots a sweet-faced young hooker, LAVERNE. She is prancing 
               around in her bra and underwear. Chulo wants her.

                                     CHULO
                              (continuing; points 
                              to her)
                         You! Mine!

               Laverne is frightened of Chulo. Mainly because he's coming 
               at her like a sex-starved buffalo. Chulo goes after her. 
               Scared, she runs around the room, then out the door. Chulo 
               gives chase.

                                     RICK
                              (to O'Neill)
                         Chulo's got such a nice, light touch 
                         with women.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

               Laverne runs down the hall, closely pursued by Chulo. An all-
               female NEW WAVE BAND comes to the door. O'Neill greets them.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Terrific. You made it... You can set 
                         up over there...

               As they enter we go to --

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Chulo is on the heels of Laverne. She bursts through a door 
               to excape him.

               INT. STAGE

               Laverne finds herself on the stage of a beauty pageant, still 
               in her bra and panties. FIVE other LADIES are dressed in 
               their bathing suits. Chulo stops short of running on stage. 
               Laverne, seeking the safety of the moment, stands in line 
               with the contestants.

               ANGLE ON MR. THOMERSON AND OTHER JUDGES

               They like what they see.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                              (to another)
                         Great bathing suit.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                              (indicating Laverne)
                         I think I screwed that one once.

               INT. THOMERSON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Debbie and the shower guests are all in a state of undress. 
               We WATCH as they put on dresses and heavy makeup. Mrs. 
               Thomerson is still freaked out over her meeting with Nick 
               the Dick.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         I had his weiner right in my hands.

                                     ILENE
                         I told you. Men are pigs... I saw 
                         them standing there.

                                     PHOEBE
                         What a gross thing to do... gawd!

                                     ILENE
                         I bet right now Rick and his pals...
                              (she spits disdainfully)
                         ...are knee deep in whores.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         A strange wang right in my palm.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Ilene, we don't really know that.

                                     BOBBIE
                         That's what we're going to find out...

                                     DEBBIE
                         I feel like I'm spying on Rick.

                                     ILENE
                         Good. That's just what we're doing.

                                     TINA
                         I'll kill Stan if I find out he's 
                         been screwing around.

               Ilene shoves socks in her bra to enhance her cleavage and 
               defiantly slaps on her new dress.

                                     ILENE
                         Brett, are you with us?

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                              (coming out of her 
                              fog)
                         Yeah, sure... I was eye to eye with 
                         an unfamiliar pud.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               The party is taking off. The all-girl band is going ape shit. 
               The guys are dancing with the hookers. They're all moving in 
               unison, to a gyrating New Wave dance step and singing along 
               with the MUSIC.

               ANGLE - RYKO

               He's wearing gravity boots, hanging upside down, entwined 
               around one of the hookers. They're hanging there, making out 
               like crazy. Gary passes by.

                                     RYKO
                         Hey, Gary, spot me.

               ANGLE - BEDROOM DOOR

               Stan comes out of the bedroom. He's disheveled, but looks 
               very happy. He crosses to Rick.

                                     STAN
                         Thanks a lot, that was the best. 
                         You're next.

                                     RICK
                         Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older 
                         brother. I need some advice here. 
                         What's the deal with marriage? What 
                         can I expect?

                                     STAN
                         Well, the first month it's great. 
                         The second month things calm down a 
                         little. By the third month you're 
                         looking through your old girlfriends' 
                         phone numbers; by the fourth month 
                         you're numb; by the fifth month, 
                         hopefully the football season starts.

                                     RICK
                         Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of 
                         help.

               Stan pats Rick on the back and dives into the festivities.

               ANGLE - GARY

               He spots someone across the room. It's like Tony spotting 
               Maria for the first time in "West Side Story." As in a DREAM 
               SEQUENCE, ALL SOUNDS STOP. Two pinspots hit them. She turns 
               and sees him. She smiles. Both are madly in love. Like two 
               pieces of metal attracted to the same magnet, they walk toward 
               each other.

                                     GARY
                         Hi.

                                     SHE
                         Hello.

               They take each other by the hand. They walk into the bedroom 
               and close the door behind them.

               The New Wave dance briefly continues, then comes to an end.

               ANOTHER ANGLE - THE HOTEL ROOM

               O'Neill grabs Ryko (who is just coming down from his gravity 
               bar) and Stan, who is wearing a pair of women's underwear on 
               his head.

                                     O'NEILL
                         You guys better get going. It's 
                         getting late.

                                     STAN
                         Oh, right.

               Ryko and Stan cross to the door and exit. As they do, four 
               or five pretty GIRLS are passing by in the hallway.

                                     GIRL
                         Is there a party going on in there 
                         or something?

                                     RYKO
                         Yeah. It's great. Go on in.

               The girls cross inside.

                                     STAN
                         My God. Fresh meat. Let's hurry back.

               INT. BATHROOM - TIGHT ON LARRY

               There is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on 
               his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. 
               WIDEN as he looks down at his right wrist.

               He heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor 
               INTO FRAME. He turns it on and runs it over his wrist. Of 
               course, nothing happens. Just then Rick enters.

                                     RICK
                         What the hell are you doing?

                                     LARRY
                         I'm trying to slash my wrists.

                                     RICK
                         You're trying to kill yourself with 
                         an electric razor?

                                     LARRY
                         I couldn't find any razor blades.

                                     RICK
                         Well, this is terrific. Now you're 
                         gonna have wrists that are smooth 
                         and kissable. Just go out there. 
                         Forget about everything and laugh it 
                         up.

                                     LARRY
                              (suddenly laughs like 
                              a crazy man)
                         Ha, ha, ha.

                                     RICK
                         No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, 
                         forget about marriage for a while. 
                         Go party.

               As he shoves Larry out, Gary enters the bathroom. His 
               expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life.

                                     RICK
                         Gary, how we doing, big stallion?

                                     GARY
                         Rick, I really think I'm in love.

                                     RICK
                         This is cause for celebration. She'll 
                         probably charge half price for sex 
                         from now on.

               Rick exits as Gary dreamily crosses to the mirror.

                                     GARY
                              (into mirror)
                         This time it's real. She's wonderful.

               Gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. Their eyes meet. 
               Gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. She turns away, 
               then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds 
               to pee. She is a man. Gary is stunned. His jaw drops open. 
               Gary's dream girl/guy finishes his business. He drops his 
               dress and turns to Gary.

                                     SHE
                         The name's Tim. I'm always available.

               He blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back.

                                     SHE/TIM
                         By the way... I also do engine work 
                         on BMW's. 'Bye.

               Tim exits. Gary feels filthy. He rips open the cabinet, takes 
               out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his 
               teeth. He rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and 
               scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat.

               EXT. STABLES - NIGHT

               Ryko and Stan drive up to a country stable. They get out of 
               the car and open a barn door. Both are pleased at what they 
               see.

                                     RYKO
                         All right.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Standing there is a donkey, eating straw.

               EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               Cole drives up in his Chulo-customized Porsche. He gets out, 
               then reaches back into the car and takes out a crossbow (the 
               heavy duty metal kind hunters use). He looks up menacingly 
               at the hotel and spots the room where the party is going on. 
               He sees another hotel across the way. He gets an idea and 
               enters the other hotel.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               The party is going full blast. Some other girls and a couple 
               of guys (hotel guests) enter the room and are quickly swept 
               up in the spirit of the party. O'Neill approaches Rick.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Rick, I'm concerned.

                                     RICK
                         About what?

                                     O'NEILL
                         This is your bachelor party. You 
                         haven't had sex with anyone yet.

                                     RICK
                              (trying to joke his 
                              way out of it)
                         Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance 
                         and see what happens.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I got something you can't resist. I 
                         have a friend, Tracey. She wants to 
                         meet you. She loves to please.

                                     RICK
                         Oooooo.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (indicating the bedroom)
                         Right in there, pal.

                                     RICK
                         If I'm not out in a half hour, send 
                         for the paramedics.

                                     O'NEILL
                         That's the old Rick!

               Rick enters the bedroom.

               INT. BEDROOM

               It's dark, but for a lamp on the nightstand which is on. In 
               one corner of the room we SEE the figure of a woman.

                                     RICK
                         Hellooo!

               Tracey walks toward Rick. The light illuminates her. What we 
               see is truly the most beautiful woman on earth. She is totally 
               nude. A vision that would make any man screw and ask questions 
               later.

                                     RICK
                              (to himself; 
                              overwhelmed by her)
                         Eat my chair!

                                     TRACEY
                         Take me... please.

               Rick instinctively makes a move toward her. He decides to go 
               for it.

               RICK'S POV - TRACEY

               Just then a strange thing happens to Tracey's face. It 
               transforms into Debbies.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Rick stops dead in his tracks. He can't believe it. Debbie's 
               face is now on Tracey's body.

                                     TRACEY/DEBBIE
                         You promised me, Rick. You promised 
                         you wouldn't make love to anyone 
                         else.

               Rick is shaken by this. He shakes his head and wipes at his 
               eyes. Debbie's face is gone. He moves toward Tracey again.

               TRACEY

               Her face transforms into Sister Mary Francis.

                                     TRACEY/SISTER MARY FRANCIS
                         Don't go back on your word, Rick. Be 
                         true; be strong.

               Sister Mary Francis's face disappears.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

                                     RICK
                         I can't do it.

               TRACEY

               Her face becomes Stan's.

                                     TRACEY/STAN
                         You nuts? Look at me, I'm beautiful!

               Stan's face turns back to Tracey's.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               All the kids from his bus are gathered around Tracey. They're 
               egging him on.

                                     KIDS
                         Do it! Come on! Put her away! Go for 
                         it!

               Debbie's face appears on Tracey's.

                                     TRACEY/DEBBIE
                              (pleading)
                         Don't Rick.

               Debbie's face disappears. Rick can't take it anymore.

                                     RICK
                         I can't do it. I love Debbie.

               He runs out of the room, leaving a very confused Tracey in 
               his wake.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM

               O'Neill is waiting outside the bedroom door as Rick comes 
               out.

                                     O'NEILL
                         How'd it go?

                                     RICK
                         Put it to you this way -- you're 
                         gonna have to pry her out of the bed 
                         with a spatula, mister.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I'm proud of you, lad.

               Rick crosses to the bar area as O'Neill watches him go, 
               beaming.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

               Cole enters the room. He runs to the window.

               COLE'S POV

               His window is right opposite the window in the hotel of Rick's 
               party.

               COLE

               He's pleased. Very pleased. He places an arrow into his 
               crossbow.

               COLE'S POV

               He's looking down his sights. Rick is the target... and an 
               easy one at that, for at this very moment Rick is crossing 
               past the window.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               The door opens and in walks Rajah, the Indian pimp. He looks 
               pissed. He's looking for Gary.

                                     RAJAH
                              (angry)
                         Am looking for this dunghead who 
                         took my women... He is being liar to 
                         me. 45 minutes way over.

               COLE'S POV

               He has Rick right where he wants him.

               CROSSBOW TRIGGER

               Cole's finger squeezes off a shot.

               RICK

               Luckily he starts to dance with a female guest. This takes 
               him out of line of the arrow.

               HOTEL SUITE WINDOW

               The arrow zooms through the open window.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               Rajah is standing by the door. The arrow zips through the 
               room, misses everyone and lodges in the wall inches from 
               Rajah's head. He looks at the arrow and realizes he almost 
               was killed.

                                     RAJAH
                              (frightened)
                         Holy Dung is this thing! I sic Milt 
                         on you. He get back bitches. Me? I 
                         haul ass.

               He runs out of the room. Rick and O'Neill watch Rajah exit, 
               confused.

                                     RICK
                         Who was that?

                                     O'NEILL
                         I don't know.

                                     RICK
                              (looking at arrow)
                         What's this?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Got me.

               Just then another arrow comes zipping through the room, 
               lodging in a chair inches from Rick.

                                     RICK
                              (to new arrow)
                         How 'bout this?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Still drawing a blank.

               They turn in the direction the arrow came from and look out 
               the window. They spot Cole loading his bow in the room across 
               the way.

                                     RICK
                         He look familiar?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Very.

                                     RICK
                         C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. 
                         We better put Cochise out of business.

               They start for the door as we go to --

               INT. BACKSTAGE OF BEAUTY PAGEANT

               Chulo is waiting outside a door that says "Dressing Room." 
               Several of the beauty contestants race out wearing formal 
               gowns. Laverne follows them, wearing a very tight black dress. 
               Chulo approaches her.

                                     LAVERNE
                         Stay away from me.

                                     CHULO
                         I'm not gonna hassle you... Don't 
                         worry. You look beautiful.

                                     LAVERNE
                              (nervous)
                         Think so? I borrowed it from one of 
                         the girls. I don't look too fat?

                                     CHULO
                         You're an angel... A madonna.

               Laverne is moved by this. Before she can respond a Stage 
               Manager takes her by the arm and pushes her on stage.

                                     STAGE MANAGER
                         You're on.

               Chulo watches Laverne enter the stage to hearty applause.

               ANGLE - THE AUDIENCE

               Mr. Thomerson and the other Judges sit in the front row making 
               notes.

               MEDIUM SHOT - THE STAGE

               The girls are lined up on pedestals as the MC approaches 
               Laverne

                                     MC
                         All right, here is your question, 
                         Miss... Er...

               He looks through his cards hurriedly and is unable to find 
               Laverne's.

                                     LAVERNE
                         Rivas.

                                     MC
                         Miss Rivas... Yes... How would you 
                         solve our country's present economic 
                         problems?

                                     LAVERNE
                         Who, me?

                                     MC
                         Yes.

                                     LAVERNE
                         That's a good question. From the way 
                         I understand it, according to supply 
                         side economics, when supply exceeds 
                         demand, recession is the result. 
                         That's why I think we should control 
                         the credit markets and increase the 
                         prime rate. That way, the consumer 
                         price index will stabilize and we 
                         will have economic recovery.

               ANGLE - THE CROWD

               They break into spontaneous applause.

               ANGLE - CHULO

               He is totally blown away.

               ANGLE - LAVERNE

               She smiles broadly at the applause and walks off stage. Chulo 
               moves alongside her.

                                     CHULO
                         How'd you know all that stuff? You're 
                         a real brain.

                                     LAVERNE
                         Nah, I used to fuck a librarian.

               Chulo looks at her with awe and respect as she exits into 
               the dressing room.

                                     CHULO
                         Wow!

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

               Debbie, her mother and the girls enter the lobby. They 
               approach the Hotel Manager, who is standing behind the front 
               desk. They are dressed garishly, like hookers. Debbie has on 
               a cheap blonde wig and mini skirt. The Manager looks at them 
               the way one would look at an approaching plague.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I don't believe we're doing this.

               The Manager crosses to them.

                                     MANAGER
                         Can I help you, ladies?

                                     DEBBIE
                         Yes, we're looking for the Stahl 
                         party.

                                     MANAGER
                         Room 1002.

               The girls turn and start toward the elevator. Mrs. Thomerson, 
               who is wearing the kind of push-up bra that makes her tits 
               look like the Black Hills, smiles at the Manager seductively. 
               He smiles back, then catches himself.

                                     MANAGER
                              (to Bellboy)
                         Those guys are asking for it.

               The girls cross to the elevator. Ilene pushes the button and 
               the doors swing open. They get inside and just before the 
               doors close, a huge behemoth of a man joins them inside. He 
               turns and faces CAMERA. It's Milt, Rajah's beefy helper. He 
               doesn't look happy as he eyes the girls. They look back at 
               him uncomfortably as the doors slam shut.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

               The elevator door opens. Milt has all the girls by the collar 
               and hustles them down the hall.

                                     ILENE
                         You're making a big mistake.

                                     MILT
                         Shut up. You still got another job 
                         to do here.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         What kind of job? I'm a housewife.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Quiet, Mother.

               Milt stops at a door and kicks it with his foot. The door 
               opens a crack at first, then swings open wide, revealing six 
               middle-aged Japanese business MEN in their underwear. They 
               smile wide at the girls, obviously thrilled with the quality 
               of the merchandise delivered to them. Milt shoves them into 
               the room.

                                     MILT
                         Get in there.

               He slams the door shut and exits.

               INT. JAPANESE GUYS' ROOM

               The guys start to move toward our panicked girls. They speak 
               to each other in Japanese (with English subtitles)

                                     JAPANESE ONE
                         Nice looking quim, huh, Bob?

                                     JAPANESE TWO
                         Yeah, you know me, Ray, I've always 
                         been a sucker for redheads.

                                     JAPANESE FOUR
                         Hubba-hubba.

                                     BOBBIE
                         Let's get out of here, girls.

               They turn toward the door. One of the Japanese races over 
               and gets there first, slamming and bolting the door shut.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Guys, take it easy. Guys.

               The girls run around the room in a panic with the Japanese 
               chasing them in very hot pursuit.

               EXT. COLE'S ROOM

               Rick, O'Neill and Tracey quietly approach Cole's door. Tracey 
               is dressed in a see-through negligee.

                                     RICK
                         This is it.
                              (he positions Tracey 
                              outside the door)
                         Go get 'im.

               He and O'Neill duck around the hallway corner, out of sight.

               INT. COLE'S ROOM

               He is at the window, holding his crossbow. He is frantically 
               searching the bachelor party across the way for any sign of 
               Rick.

                                     COLE
                         Where the hell is he?

               He hears a KNOCK on the DOOR. Cole quickly hides his crossbow 
               under the bed and answers the door.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Tracey stands in the open door. Cole's jaw drops open. He 
               has never seen anything as lovely.

                                     COLE
                         Yeah?

                                     TRACEY
                         Make love to me... please.

               She walks into the room. Cole closes the door.

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE COLE'S DOOR

               Rick and O'Neill run up to the door. They listen closely. We 
               HEAR the SOUND of Cole's SHIRT being RIPPED off, the buttons 
               flying around the room, then the SOUND of his pant ZIPPER 
               being undone.

                                     RICK
                         T minus... 3... 2... 1. We have 
                         ignition.

               e and O'Neill burst into the room and close the door.

                                     COLE (O.S.)
                         Hey!

               INT. COLE'S ROOM

               O'Neill is tying the end of a sheet around the bed post. We 
               SEE the bed is minus its sheets and blankets.

                                     O'NEILL
                         All set here.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The guys have tied the sheets and blankets together and made 
               a rope. The other end is tied around Cole's chest. And that's 
               all Cole is wearing; he's nude.

                                     COLE
                         You guys are never going to get away 
                         with this.

               Rick stuffs Cole's underwear in his mouth to gag him.

                                     RICK
                         We're just going to keep you in a 
                         safe place until after the party.

               He and O'Neill lift Cole up and put him out the window. They 
               hang onto the sheet/blanket rope and lower him slowly outside.

               EXT. HOTEL

               We SEE Cole being lowered from the window.

               CLOSER ON COLE

               He's struggling, but can do nothing about his predicament. 
               He looks down.

               COLE'S POV

               The hotel parking lot is ten stories below.

               COLE

               He looks up to the guys.

               RICK AND O'NEILL

               They look down at him from the window above.

                                     RICK
                         Now, don't get into any trouble.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Take care.

                                     RICK & O'NEILL
                         Byeeeee!

               They duck inside the window.

               INT. COLE'S ROOM

               Rick, O'Neill and Tracey exit the room.

                                     RICK
                              (to Tracey)
                         Don't you wish you were a guy so you 
                         could have fun like this?

               COLE

               He's scared to death.

               INT. COLE'S ROOM

               We SEE that Cole's weight is pulling the bed to the window.

               COLE

               He's slowly lowering down the side of the building.

               INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM

               A YOUNG COUPLE enters the room. They are very much in love. 
               He gives her a kiss and closes the door.

                                     MAN
                         Why don't you get comfortable?

               She smiles coyly and starts to undress. He crosses to the 
               closed blinds.

                                     MAN
                              (continuing)
                         There's a wonderful moon out tonight.

               He opens the blinds, revealing Cole's ass pressed up against 
               the window.

               WOMAN

               She screams, horrified.

               INT. JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN'S ROOM

               The girls are being hotly pursued by the Japanese men.

                                     JAPANESE/RAY
                              (subtitled)
                         Hey, Bob, this beats the shit out of 
                         sushi, doesn't it?

               INT. COLE'S ROOM

               The bed moves right up against the wall under the window. We 
               SEE the end tied to the bed post is beginning to untie.

               COLE

               He's panicked.

               INT. COLE'S ROOM

               The knot unties.

               COLE

               He falls OUT OF FRAME. The "rope" trailing behind.

               INT. CAR

               The young couple from the room are seated in his sportscar. 
               He's cranking open the sun roof.

                                     MAN
                         Babe, I didn't know anything about 
                         that.

               The sun roof opens. Suddenly Cole's ass sticks through it. 
               The Woman freaks out again.

               EXT. SPORTSCAR

               We SEE a groggy Cole sitting in the sun roof. The Man in the 
               car is trying to calm down his lady.

               INT. BANQUET ROOM - BACKSTAGE

               Chulo and Laverne are standing in the wings while in the 
               b.g. we can SEE the MC singing the Moosehead Beer jingle. 
               Then:

                                     MC
                         All right, can we have our five 
                         finalists, please.

                                     CHULO
                         Good luck, Laverne.

               Laverne and the five finalists go out on stage.

               ANGLE - MR. THOMERSON

               He gives an envelope to the MC.

                                     MC
                         Thank you, Mr. Thomerson. Well, the 
                         judges have made their decision, and 
                         this year's Miss Moosehead Beer is...

               ANGLE - THE GIRLS

               They are all nervous, especially Laverne.

                                     MC
                         Laverne Rivas.

               Laverne squeals with delight and hugs the MC as he puts the 
               bejeweled crown on her head. Then the MC leads her to the 
               microphone.

                                     LAVERNE
                              (teary-eyed)
                         I can't believe it. This is the 
                         happiest day of my life, and I owe 
                         it all to him.

               She points O.S. to Chulo, Chulo, with tears in his eyes, 
               comes out on stage and, in a surge of emotion, picks Laverne 
               up off her feet and hugs her passionately.

               ANGLE - THE JUDGES

                                     JUDGE
                         I know I've had that girl.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                              (looking at Chulo)
                         And I know that guy from somewhere, 
                         too.

               The other judge looks at Mr. Thomerson suspiciously.

               EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT

               CAMERA PUSHES IN TO a car in the parking lot which is towing 
               a U-Haul trailer behind it. The car stops and turns off its 
               lights.

               INT. CAR

               Stan and O'Neill sit in the car looking at the hotel.

                                     STAN
                         How the hell are we supposed to get 
                         this donkey inside?

                                     RYKO
                         I don't know.

                                     STAN
                         What? I thought you told me you had 
                         it all figured out.

                                     RYKO
                         Maybe I did... I don't remember.

                                     STAN
                              (through clenched 
                              teeth)
                         I'd love to get you in an operating 
                         room. Just once.

               ANGLE - HOTEL ENTRANCE

               Just then the "Moose" from the beauty pageant steps outside 
               the hotel for a smoke.

               The guy in front removes the head, takes a drag of his 
               cigarette and passes it to the guy bringing up the rear. 
               After a beat, smoke steams out the rear end of the costume.

               ANGLE - THE GUYS IN THE CAR

               They both have the same idea. They stroll out of the car and 
               approach the two men in the moose suit. We can't hear what 
               they're saying, but we can SEE the bills Stan is taking out 
               of his pocket. Ryko grabs the moosehead and runs over to the 
               trailer with it.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - A FEW MINUTES LATER

               The door opens and Stan and Ryko enter pulling the "Moose" 
               by a rope.

                                     RYKO
                         Can you believe how perfect it fits?

                                     STAN
                         Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both 
                         be a size 138 regular.

               Just then Rick and O'Neill saunter into the lobby.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Hey, you guys...

                                     RICK
                         Who's your friend?

                                     STAN
                              (keeping it a surprise)
                         Oh... it's... er... the guys from 
                         the beer convention. We're bringing 
                         them to the party.

                                     RICK
                         Great.
                              (to moose)
                         I was wondering, how do you guys go 
                         to the bathroom in that thing?

               At that moment he HEARS a SPLAT hit the ground. The guys 
               look down and see a large, shiny clump of shiny brown 
               excrement nestled in the shag carpet.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         Say no more.

               The Manager crosses to them.

                                     MANAGER
                         I don't know which one of you did 
                         this, but you're not going anywhere 
                         till you clean up this disgusting 
                         mess.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (resigned)
                         Anybody got a paper towel or a shovel 
                         or something?

               All the guests turn away in disgust. Stan takes out a 
               handkerchief and hands it to Rick, who closes his eyes and 
               picks up the warm little bundle. The Manager turns and walks 
               off in a huff. On the way back to the elevator, Rick checks 
               to see no one is watching and places the handkerchief's 
               contents on the front desk, just OUT OF FRAME. Smiling 
               contentedly, the guys lead the reluctant "moose" into the 
               elevator. The doors slam shut.

               ANGLE AT THE DESK

               The Manager is just finishing checking in a couple from out 
               of town.

                                     MANAGER
                         I'll have the boy take your bags up.

               He goes to hit the bell and to his surprise, his hand comes 
               down on something soft and mushy. The look on his face tells 
               us what it is. It's the "gift" Rick left behind.

                                     MANAGER
                              (to couple)
                         Excuse me. I seem to have a hand 
                         full of potty.

               Revolted, he races into a room marked "MEN."

               ANGLE - BALLROOM DOORS

               The doors open and several people from the Moosehead beauty 
               pageant come out. Mr. Thomerson is one of them.

                                     EXECUTIVE
                         Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We 
                         appreciate it.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Any time, Al.

               Mr. T. crosses to the door just as Cole comes running in, 
               slightly dazed, wrapped in the tattered remnants of the sheet 
               that held him suspended out the window. They both are shocked 
               to see one another.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing 
                         here? What happened?

                                     COLE
                              (nearly hysterical)
                         The bachelor party's upstairs. They 
                         made me get naked. They hung me from 
                         the window so high up it was so scary 
                         I fell down...

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Take hold of yourself. What room are 
                         they in?

                                     COLE
                         1002. 

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         All right, I'll go up there and take 
                         care of this myself.
                              (disgusted)
                         You look awful, son. Go find yourself 
                         some clothes.

                                     COLE
                         Yes, sir.

               With a determined look, Thomerson crosses to the elevator, 
               as Cole runs into the hotel gift shop.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

               Rick, Ryko, Stan, O'Neill enter with the "moose."

                                     RICK
                         Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.

                                     LARRY
                         It's Bullwinkle.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Gentlemen... Ladies... For your 
                         viewing pleasure, meet Mike the 
                         Magical Sexual Mule.

               O'Neill lifts the head off the moose costume, revealing a 
               real burro. The burro shows all his teeth as burros are apt 
               to do when excited. O'Neill and Stan zip off the rest of his 
               costume, revealing a well-endowed beast.

                                     RICK
                              (surprised)
                         How about this, a Trojan donkey.

                                     O'NEILL
                         And here's Mike's partner, in more 
                         ways than one. A gal who doesn't 
                         think happiness ends with primates. 
                         The very lovely, Miss Desiree...

               DESIREE, an erotic, tall woman wearing a leather face mask, 
               comes out of the bedroom carrying a long whip. Desiree puts 
               Ravel's "Bolero" on the PHONOGRAPH; then she starts to sway 
               her hips sensuously in front of the animal.

               ANGLE - THE PARTY GUESTS

               They all scream and holler approval.

               ANGLE - DESIREE

               She rubs up against the donkey, shaking her backside against 
               the animal's.

                                     RICK
                         Swell. She's gonna pin her tail on 
                         the donkey.

               Now all eyes are on Desiree as she does an erotic striptease.

               ANGLE - THE DONKEY

               It is getting bored and a little hungry. It bends its head 
               to the left and spots the table with food on it. It bends 
               over and starts munching on some cole slaw.

               ANGLE - DESIREE

               To the catcalls of the partygoers, Desiree is getting all 
               worked up, stripping down to a G-string.

               THE DONKEY

               It's had enough cole slaw. Now it sniffs at Larry's drug 
               smorgasbord and then starts to chomp on a few pills. Next it 
               sticks its head into the lines of coke and snorts them up in 
               one gigantic sniff.

               ANGLE - DESIREE

               She lets her long, flowing hair hang down over her breasts. 
               Then she takes a mattress and sets it on the floor. She rolls 
               on it and sways her hips sensuously on her knees.

               ANGLE - HER AUDIENCE

               Rick can't believe he's seeing this. The other guys are 
               screaming at the top of their lungs. Even Larry seems spell-
               bound.

               ANGLE - THE DONKEY

               It doesn't look so hot as it finishes off every drug on the 
               table.

               ANGLE - DESIREE

               She moves over to the donkey, hits him on the side gently 
               with her whip, then pulls him over to her mattress. The 
               donkey's blood-shot eyes are the size of saucers. Once again 
               he shows his teeth in a kind of shit-eating grin. Desiree 
               drops to the mattress and beckons the animal to her. Mike 
               the Donkey obediently does as he's told, moving to her in a 
               trance-like, very turned-on state.

                                     DESIREE
                         C'mon, Mike... Come to Mama.

               The Donkey takes another step forward, and then suddenly 
               rears up on his hind legs, snorting. He starts bucking wildly. 
               The crowd moves out of his way as the animal goes berserk 
               for a few seconds, then without warning collapses in a heap 
               on the floor.

               Everyone goes rushing up to it.

               Chulo and Laverne enter the room, followed by several of the 
               other contestants and others from the beauty pageant.

                                     CHULO
                              (excited)
                         Hey, you guys, I'm getting married.
                              (to Laverne)
                         We're gonna make lots of kids.

               He looks over and sees everyone gathered around Mike.

                                     CHULO
                         What the hell happened?

               Gary shushes him. We PUSH IN ON Dr. Stan, who is listening 
               for signs of life in the animal's chest. Finally Stan stands 
               up somberly.

                                     STAN
                         Drug overdose.

                                     DESIREE
                         You mean it's...

                                     STAN
                         Afraid so. I did everything I could.

                                     LARRY
                         It's my fault. He's dead because... 
                         I left those drugs...

                                     RICK
                         It's really not all your fault. I 
                         was talking to Mike earlier and he 
                         had a lot of problems. Personal 
                         things, you know. Made some bad 
                         investments. At least now he's 
                         peaceful...

                                     O'NEILL
                         C'mon, we gotta get this thing out 
                         of here.

               O'Neil places the moosehead on the donkey as Rick, Gary, 
               Chulo and Stan pull the donkey out into the hall like 
               pallbearers at a funeral.

               INT. HALLWAY

               Mr. Thomerson, who's been standing at the door, takes this 
               time to sneak into the suite right behind them.

               INT. RICK'S SUITE

               Mr. Thomerson can't believe the goings-on. People are making 
               out, drinking and dancing. He hides in a corner to watch 
               undercover.

               ANGLE IN CORRIDOR

               The guys shove the donkey onto the elevator and the doors 
               snap shut.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY

                                     MANAGER
                              (on phone)
                         Yes... I see... Of course we don't 
                         allow that sort of thing here, ma'am. 
                         No... Well, I'm sorry the noise woke 
                         you. I'll take care of it right away.

               He hangs up and crosses to the elevator.

                                     MANAGER
                         I've had enough of this.

               Just then the elevator door swings open. The donkey falls 
               out into the lobby. The Manager screams in terror, as do 
               several of the hotel guests.

                                     MANAGER
                              (continuing)
                         That's it. I'm calling the cops.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

               Some more uninvited guests come drifting into the room.

                                     RICK
                         Welcome, welcome, one and all.

                                     MR. THOMERSON (O.S.)
                         Rick!

                                     RICK
                              (recognizing the voice)
                         Oh, no!

               He turns and spots Mr. Thomerson as he makes his way through 
               the party.

                                     RICK
                         Christ... it's Mr. Laughs.

               Mr. Thomerson goes nose to nose with Rick.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         This is it. You're through. When 
                         Debbie hears about this she'll never 
                         see you again. Now I'm calling the 
                         cops to break up this sex orgy... 
                         And toss your ass in jail!

               He turns away and walks OUT OF FRAME. O'Neill crosses to 
               Rick.

                                     O'NEILL
                         What are you going to do about it?

                                     RICK
                              (defeated)
                         What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's 
                         going to go crazy and end the whole 
                         thing.

                                     O'NEILL
                         I'll stop him... You stall him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Mr. Thomerson is heading for the phone in the bedroom.

                                     RICK
                         Mr. Thomerson!

               Thomerson stops and turns to Rick.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing; dramatic)
                         Please, no. Don't ruin my life. 
                         Please!

               He drops to his knees and hugs Thomerson's legs. The party 
               stops and everyone watches.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         It's not me. I was brought up on the 
                         wrong side of the tracks. A victim 
                         of my environment...

               INT. HOTEL BEDROOM - O'NEILL AND LARRY

               Larry is handing O'Neill a plastic bag filled with white 
               powder.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Is that all the coke in the place?

                                     LARRY
                         That's it.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Good.

               O'Neill unscrews the mouthpiece off the phone. He pours the 
               bag of cocaine into the phone. He then screws the mouthpiece 
               back on over this mound of powder. Satisfied with his work, 
               he exits the bedroom.

               INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM

               Thomerson is trying to free himself from Rick's grasp as 
               Rick continues with his "hard luck" story.

                                     RICK
                         My poor old mammy had to take in 
                         laundry. My pappy had to work 20 
                         hours a day at the Pez Factory.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               O'Neill gestures to Rick that everything's ready. Rick 
               immediately jumps to his feet.

                                     RICK
                         The end.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         No sob story is going to change my 
                         mind.

               Mr. Thomerson pushes O'Neill aside and enters the bedroom.

                                     O'NEILL
                         The phone's all yours.

               Mr. Thomerson, in the bedroom, picks up the receiver. As he 
               does so, a cloud of cocaine falls out of the mouthpiece. He 
               screams at Rick, gesturing with the phone in his hand as he 
               dials. Each move produces a large cloud of powder, which 
               causes him to sniffle slightly.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         I never liked you. I've never liked 
                         any of your friends. I've hated you 
                         from the first time I saw you. And 
                         now you are out of my life. You are 
                         out of my life!

               He starts to react from inhaling the powder. He puts the 
               receiver to his ear. He takes a deep breath and tries to 
               dial another number. A large cloud of coke flies up his nose. 
               He's stunned. He takes another deep drag. He's hooked. He 
               forgets all about dialing. He jams the receiver against his 
               nose and takes deep drag after deep drag.

               Desiree, still wearing her leather mask, crosses to him and 
               sits down next to him on the bed. He gives her a big, wide 
               smile.

               O'Neill closes the door.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Reach out and snort someone.

                                     RICK
                         I'm saved. Let's party!

               Everyone starts to whoop it up again.

               INT. JAPANESE SUITE

               It's still a standoff between the girls and the horny 
               Japanese.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Let's give them what they want.

                                     PHOEBE
                         What?

               Debbie opens the bedroom door and motions for the Japanese 
               to file in.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Let's go. Everyone inside.

               The Japanese immediately put two and two together and get 
               orgy. These are some happy fellas as they enter the bedroom.

                                     BOBBIE
                         Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (herding in the last 
                              Japanese)
                         Right in here. The big show starts 
                         in one minute.

               The Japanese man enters the room. Debbie slams the door shut 
               behind him.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Let's go.

                                     ILENE
                         Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and 
                         hold them off. The rest of you break 
                         for it!

                                     DEBBIE
                         Ilene, are you crazy?

                                     ILENE
                         I know what I'm doing... Go!

               The girls run out the door.

               INT. JAPANESE BEDROOM

               Ilene smiles. She has what she wants. She walks into the 
               bedroom, surrounded by panting Japanese.

                                     ILENE
                         Gentlemen, the gods have answered 
                         your prayers... Bonzai!

               She takes a running leap and dives on top of the Japanese.

               INT. CORRIDOR

               Debbie and the ladies run to an elevator. Debbie presses the 
               "down" button.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         I hope Ilene's all right.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I hope those guys are all right.

               The elevator door opens, revealing the donkey lying flat on 
               his back. His stiff legs point skyward. The girls see him 
               and scream. They run down the hall to the stairway. On the 
               way Debbie notices she's passing Room 1002. She HEARS the 
               party SOUNDS inside.

               She heads for the room angrily. This is a lady out to even a 
               score.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

               As Debbie opens the door, her father walks by with Desiree 
               on his arm. Neither sees the other. Debbie enters the room. 
               She is surprised by the masses of humanity rubbing shoulders 
               with one another in the room.

               O'Neill looks over from the other side of the room and spots 
               her. He isn't fooled for a minute by her wig and mini skirt. 
               He runs over to Rick.

                                     O'NEILL
                         Guess who's here? Another surprise 
                         guest.

                                     RICK
                         Who?

                                     O'NEILL
                         Debbie.

                                     RICK
                         My Debbie?

                                     O'NEILL
                         What's with her costume?

               O'Neill points and Rick sees Debbie. She doesn't see them.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         I don't know... Go up to her, make 
                         like you don't know her and send her 
                         into the other bedroom.

                                     O'NEILL
                         You got it.

               O'Neill crosses to Debbie.

                                     O'NEILL
                              (continuing)
                         Hi, baby. You're new here. I don't 
                         think the groom's had you yet, has 
                         he?

               PUSH IN ON Debbie. She's pissed.

                                     DEBBIE
                         No, not yet. Where is he?

               INT. BEDROOM

               Rick opens the door from the bathroom. The lights are turned 
               off and from the flashing illumination of a neon sign outside 
               the window we can MAKE OUT the outline of Debbie's body on 
               the bed.

                                     RICK
                         I can't see anything.

               Debbie, in a disguised Southern accent, speaks out.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Don't turn on the lights, sugar.
                              (seductively)
                         I'll lead you around.

                                     RICK
                         How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.

                                     DEBBIE
                         Why don't you get undressed.

               Rick starts to undress. While undressing, he takes on the 
               persona of Mr. Rodgers. He sings Rodgers' opening theme in 
               that same sappy, child-like manner of his.

                                     RICK
                              (singing)
                         It's a lovely day in the neighborhood. 
                         It's a lovely day, it's a beauty, 
                         would you be mine, could you be mine.
                              (he's now stripped 
                              down to his underwear)
                         ...Please won't you be my neighbor.
                              (as Mr. Rodgers)
                         Hi... Hi there... Today we're going 
                         to learn about anatomy...

               He jumps on top of her and starts mauling her passionately. 
               Debbie snaps on the lights. She throws off her wig and she 
               and Rick come face to face.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         Debbie... you're a hooker! I can't 
                         believe it!

               She all but jumps out of bed.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I can't trust you!

                                     RICK
                         C'mon, I knew it was you.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (holding back tears)
                         Rick, you're lying!

               As Rick protests, she throws on her blouse and runs out of 
               the room. Rick charges after her.

               INT. HOTEL SUITE - MAIN ROOM

               The place is wall to wall people.

               ANGLE - DEBBIE

               She tries to make her way to the exit, but her path is slowed 
               by all the happy revelers.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (yelling over the 
                              din; furious)
                         Let go of me!

                                     RICK
                              (yelling back)
                         Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do 
                         anything, hardly.

                                     DEBBIE
                         The marriage is off. Now you can 
                         screw around with your friends for 
                         the rest of your life.

                                     RICK
                         I don't want that. I want to be with 
                         you.

                                     DEBBIE
                         And I want to be with someone who 
                         understands the meaning of the word 
                         commitment.

                                     RICK
                         I am committed. I love you.

               Just then Desiree and Mr. Thomerson cross THROUGH FRAME. 
               She's leading him around by the silver chain, which is now 
               attached to his neck. She's also carrying a leather whip.

                                     DEBBIE
                         I don't believe you.

                                     RICK
                         You don't believe me? Okay, fine.

               Rick gets up on the sofa and yells loudly over the din.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         People! Can I have your attention... 
                         people!

               Everyone stops what they're doing and looks up.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         I want to ask you all a question. 
                         Have I had sex with anybody in this 
                         room tonight?

               There's a negative response from the crowd.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         Are you sure?

               Everyone responds positively.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         Thank you.

               All the guests go back to partying. Rick drops off the sofa 
               and faces Debbie.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         See? And these are not just ordinary 
                         party-goers -- there are professionals 
                         in this crowd -- I didn't want any 
                         of them. You... You're what I want. 
                         Understand?

                                     DEBBIE
                              (melted)
                         Yes...

                                     RICK
                         Great. Now, what do you want to do 
                         about it?

                                     DEBBIE
                              (sexy)
                         Let's get naked.

                                     RICK
                         You're on.

               She takes him by the hand and crosses into the other bedroom.

               INT. OTHER BEDROOM

               Rick and Debbie enter. To their surprise they find a man 
               wearing a leather mask tied to the bed and happily licking 
               Desiree's boots, which she dangles in front of him. She also 
               holds a whip over his head. Despite the mask, there is 
               something very familiar about his face, and the white powder 
               encrusted all over his nose.

               Debbie picks up on this immediately.

                                     DEBBIE
                              (shocked)
                         Daddy?

               Sure enough, Mr. Thomerson looks up and grimaces, knowing 
               he's been caught with his bondage down. He tries to say 
               something, but the boot in his mouth prevents anything 
               intelligent from coming out.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...

                                     RICK
                         Of course, sir. That explains it. 
                         Leather is a very good source of 
                         vitamin E.

               INT. SUITE - MAIN ROOM

               The party has reached fever pitch. Suddenly police SIRENS 
               pierce through the party sounds. Everyone freezes. We HEAR 
               the Hotel Manager BEATING on the DOOR with his fists.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

               The Manager is pounding on the door. By his side are several 
               UNIFORMED POLICE.

                                     MANAGER
                         You're all under arrest. Open up!

               INT. HOTEL SUITE

                                     RICK
                              (to everyone in the 
                              room)
                         Your attention, please. May I be the 
                         first to say, It's a raid!

               Everyone starts to panic and run for the doors.

                                     RICK
                              (continuing)
                         I'm glad no one is panicking.

               He snaps up his clothes from the bedroom.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR

                                     MANAGER
                              (to Police)
                         Break it in, boys!

               The cops rear back for a run at the door. At that moment the 
               hotel door opens up and the cops and the Manager are trampled 
               by Rick, Debbie, Mr. Thomerson, Rick's gang, other guests 
               and assorted hookers. They run down the stairs. The cops 
               pick themselves up and give chase. The Manager looks inside 
               the room and is devastated by what he sees... Hiroshima looked 
               better after the A-bomb.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY

               We SEE the police have collared Bobbie, Phoebe, Mrs. Thomerson 
               and the other ladies of the shower as hooker suspects. Our 
               bachelor party mob now charges down the stairs and out the 
               hotel doors.

               The cops grab Mr. Thomerson as he tries to get out, and they 
               throw him in line with the others. Unfortunately for him, 
               he's standing next to Mrs. Thomerson.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         Ed! What are you doing here?

               Before he can answer, Mrs. Thomerson checks out his shocking 
               leather outfit.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                              (angry)
                         Ed... you're kinky!

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         The phone made me do it!

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                              (shocked)
                         You've been having strange sex...!

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         No, Brett, I...

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         It's all right...
                              (proudly)
                         So have I.

               He is totally blown away by this as the cops lead them out 
               of the room.

                                     MRS. THOMERSON
                         I've seen another man's diddly.

               EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

               Our people pile out of the hotel. Rick, Debbie and all Rick's 
               friends run down the street.

               Suddenly a Porsche pulls up between Rick and Debbie. It's 
               Cole. He reaches over and pulls Debbie into the car with 
               him. She screams.

                                     RICK
                         Cole, what the hell are you doing?

                                     COLE
                         She's mine!

               He drives off.

                                     RICK
                         He's kidnapped her! Everyone into 
                         the bus!

               They all board the bus.

               EXT. CITY STREET

               As Cole rounds a corner, a tire comes loose and rolls off 
               the car -- thanks to Chulo's shoddy workmanship.

               INT. PORSCHE

                                     COLE
                         Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

               He looks to the rear and sees Rick's bus not far behind them. 
               Suddenly he spots something O.S. He grabs Debbie and runs 
               OUT OF FRAME.

               EXT. CITY STREET

               A city maintenance truck is driving slowly down the center 
               of the street. A man in the back of the truck is leisurely 
               placing orange cones in the center line of the road.

               Cole, with Debbie in tow, grabs the truck's DRIVER and hauls 
               him out of his seat. He then places Debbie inside the truck 
               and him at the wheel. He peels out. Our man with the cones 
               in the back is unaware of what has happened. He keeps placing 
               the cones on the street. However, now the truck is hitting 
               speeds in the upper 70's. The man's leisure pace speeds up. 
               He rapidly places cones on the road at break-neck speed.

               INT. RICK'S BUS

               Rick, is plowing into the cones and knocking them all over.

               MAINTENANCE TRUCK

               Our man with the cones is almost completely exhausted.

               EXT. HIGHWAY

               Rick is in pursuit, knocking over cones. He's almost caught 
               up with Cole.

               EXT. STREET

               The vehicles reach the top of the hill. Cole grabs a sharp 
               left and pulls into a movie theater parking lot. The maneuver 
               loses Rick for a second. Rick jams on the brakes and doubles 
               back into the parking lot.

               EXT. MOVIE THEATER PARKING LOT

               Cole pulls up with a SCREECH in front of the theater. He 
               grabs Debbie and jumps out of the truck. He drags her into 
               the theater entrance.

               Rick brings his bus to a stop and he and the gang pour out 
               of the bus.

                                     COLE
                         He and Debbie stand outside the 
                         theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. 
                         Fourteen movie theaters under one 
                         roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: 
                         "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags 
                         Debbie into one of the theaters. The 
                         gang runs up to the theaters.

                                     RICK
                         Fan out and look for them.

               They all go running into various theaters.

               ANGLE - RYKO

               He approaches a theater and sees the title of the movie 
               playing inside.

                                     RYKO
                         Aw, I've seen this one already.

               Rick chooses a theater and goes inside.

               INT. MOVIE THEATER

               The patrons are wearing their 3D glasses, watching the action 
               on the screen. On the movie screen we SEE a man and a woman 
               arguing. Cole and Debbie enter the theater. They run down to 
               the front of the screen, heading for an exit. Rick enters. 
               He gives chase and catches up with Cole.

               He takes a swing at Cole and Cole swings back. Behind them 
               on the screen a man has come to the rescue of the woman.

               A fight starts in the movie, also. The patrons sit calmly 
               watching the action. Miraculously, Rick's fight with Cole is 
               in perfect sync with the actors in the movie. Rick hits Cole 
               with a punch that sends him backwards into several movie 
               patrons. The patrons are impressed by the realism of the 
               film's special effects. Cole throws a punch. Rick ducks. The 
               punch hits a MAN in the front row in the mouth.

                                     MAN
                              (to LADY next to him)
                         Gee, what a realistic effect.

                                     WOMAN
                         Yeah, like you're in the movie with 
                         them.

               Rick climbs over several rows and continues to pummel Cole. 
               Cole grabs a woman's purse and begins to hit Rick with it. 
               Cole runs out of the aisle as Rick climbs over people and 
               dives onto Cole, knocking him to the aisle.

                                     PATRON
                              (to his date)
                         Best 3D I've ever seen.

               As the movie ends, Rick has Cole by the collar and is dragging 
               him out of the theater.

               INT. MALL OUTSIDE THEATER

               Rick exits the theater with Cole. He tosses Cole to Chulo. 
               Debbie comes running behind Rick.

                                     RICK
                              (to Debbie)
                         Are you okay?

                                     DEBBIE
                         Yeah.

                                     RICK
                         This has been quite a night. Here's 
                         a thought. Why don't we go home and 
                         give our private parts a workout?

                                     DEBBIE
                              (hugging him)
                         You're so romantic...

               The Patrons are exiting. All of them are very up and excited 
               by their 3D experience.

                                     WOMAN
                         Absolutely amazing.

               A Man who has taken a punch and has had his jacket ripped to 
               shreds doesn't seem pleased.

                                     MAN
                         I've seen better.

               EXT. BLUFF - DAY

               It's another gorgeous day on the bluff overlooking the ocean. 
               Just right for Rick and Debbie's wedding. We SEE the wedding 
               in progress. The area is adorned with flowers.

               The many guests are seated and taken in the moment. Among 
               these are Tracey, Desiree and Gary's she-man, who waves to 
               Gary as he stands with the other ushers, Chulo, Ryko and 
               Larry. Chulo is choked up and trying to hide his tears. He 
               looks over at Laverne, who smiles to him.

                                     CHULO
                              (to Ryko)
                         Hey, man, don't forget my bachelor 
                         party's next Friday night.

                                     GARY
                         I'll get the hookers.

                                     RYKO
                         No way.

               Nearby stand the maids of honor, Bobbie, Phoebie and Ilene, 
               who blows a kiss to her date, Ray (one of the Japanese 
               businessmen).

               The Thomersons sit in the front row. Neither of them is 
               cherishing this moment.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                              (sotto; to Mrs. 
                              Thomerson)
                         We'll have morons for grandkids.
                              (resigned to the fact)
                         But... at least we'll have grandkids.

               They sort of smile at each other at the thought.

               Father Falwell is almost through with the ceremony. A car 
               pulls up in the b.g. Exiting the car is Stan and a WOMAN. 
               O'Neill, the best man, sees the car. He pokes Rick. He 
               indicates to Rick someone has arrived.

               STAN

               We SEE the man in the car is Stan. He ushers the lady in the 
               car to Larry. He's surprised at who she is: his wife.

                                     LARRY
                         Sue!

                                     SUE
                         Hi, honey.

                                     LARRY
                         How'd you get here?

                                     SUE
                         Rick called me.

               Larry looks to Rick and gives him a warm smile and a wave. 
               Rick acknowledges Larry.

                                     LARRY
                         Why don't we go someplace and talk.

               They walk off.

               FATHER FALWELL

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         Now, before I pronounce you man and 
                         wife, the groom wishes to recite his 
                         vow to Debbie. Richard.

                                     THOMERSONS
                         They fear the worst.

                                     MR. THOMERSON
                         Oh, God Almighty.

               RICK

               He turns to Debbie. He waits a beat and begins.

                                     RICK
                         Cheese. I love you more than cheese. 
                         And I love cheese a lot.

                                     THOMERSONS
                         They hide their faces in their hands. 
                         Off in the distance a storm is coming 
                         in fast over the ocean. The wind 
                         begins to pick up. Undaunted, Rick 
                         continues his soliloquy.

                                     RICK
                         In fact, more than dairy products in 
                         general. I love dairy. My love is 
                         cream. Pour me on the cereal of your 
                         life...

               Now it starts to rain.

               FATHER FALWELL

               He wants this to end. He calls softly to Rick, trying to get 
               his attention.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                         Rick. Rick. Hey...

               People begin to scurry for cover. In the b.g., under a tree, 
               we SEE Larry and his wife huddled in each other's arms. From 
               the way they look, they have worked things out.

               RICK

                                     RICK
                         I think this song pretty much sums 
                         up the way I feel at this moment.

               He begins to sing the theme from "The Flintstones" with all 
               the gusto of Jack Jones.

               Father Falwell has had enough.

                                     FATHER FALWELL
                              (rapid fire)
                         I now pronounce you man and wife. 
                         Goodbye.

               He blesses them lightning fast and springs for his car.

               THE SCENE

               CREDITS ROLL as Rick continues to sing in the driving rain. 
               Debbie joins in on the chorus. She loves her man.

               Everyone has run for the safety of their cars. Everyone but 
               the Thomersons, who sit and look on bewildered.

                                     RICK AND DEBBIE
                         "Flintstones, meet the Flintstones 
                         They're a prehistoric family From

INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly
sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a
foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.

                    ZOE (V.O.)
          I can't believe I didn't get a
          pedicure for this. How
          embarrassing. Look at that...

The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.

                    ZOE (V.O.)(CONT'D)
          What's wrong with me? If I were
          with a real guy doing this, I
          would've gotten a pedicure. And a
          wax. I'm pathetic.

The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.

                    ZOE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Fuck, that one's even worse. And
          when did my toes get so fat? No
          wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed
          animal.

Zoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.

                       DR. HARRIS
          What?

DR. HARRIS (mid-fifties, jovial) looks up from between Zoe's
knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.

                    ZOE
          My toes...sorry.

                    DR. HARRIS
          I'm not looking at your toes.

                     ZOE
          Right.   Duh.

Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.


                       DR. HARRIS
          All done.
                                                           2.


                       ZOE
          That's it?

And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper
gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something,
girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.

                    DR. HARRIS
          I'll elevate your legs for ten
          minutes and then you're good to go.

He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her
legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.

                    ZOE
          This is the first time I've heard
          that ticking clock sound and it
          doesn't freak me out.

                     DR. HARRIS
          Good.   Just relax.

                    ZOE
          I can't, I'm totally freaking out.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Everything's going to be great. I
          have a feeling you and...
              (checks empty syringe)
          Number CRM-101404 are going to make
          beautiful babies together.

Zoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right.

                    BOBBY (V.O.)
          Number CRM-101404? Are you high?


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

TITLE UP: FOUR WEEKS AGO

BOBBY, 39 (but says he's 33,) gay and gorgeous, opens a file
and points to a piece of paper.

                    BOBBY
          Says here he has red hair and
          freckles.

                    ZOE
          And glasses, too.

                    BOBBY
          And why are we picking him?
                                                 3.


                    ZOE
          Because he's honest.

                       BOBBY
          He's ugly.

Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.

                    ZOE
          You think they're all telling the
          truth? If they're so smart and
          good looking, why are they beating
          off into a cup?

                    BOBBY
          Have you ever fucked a guy with red
          hair and freckles?

                    ZOE
          No, and I won't have to.

                     BOBBY
          But what about your kid? No one's
          going to want to fuck your kid.
              (beat)
          That came out wrong.

                    ZOE
          Yeah...it's a good thing you're not
          going to be the father.


INT. WAVERLY INN   - NIGHT

TITLE UP: EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Bobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.

                      BOBBY
          What?    I can't be the father!

                    ZOE
          Come on, we don't have to have sex.

                    BOBBY
          Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think
          about that. Rewind, rewind,
          rewind...

                    ZOE
          You're one of my best friends.
          Don't you want to help me?
                                                           4.


                    BOBBY
          Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll
          walk your dog, tell you when you
          look fat, be honest about your
          eyebrows...

                    ZOE
          Just a few sperm. Big deal. You
          waste billions of them every night.

                    BOBBY
          You know I flee at the slightest
          chance of intimacy. Do you see
          these bags under my eyes? Ricardo
          slept over last night, and he
          wanted to hold me. I actually had
          to fake a seizure.

                       ZOE
          Forget it.     Forget the whole thing.

Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.

                     MONA (V.O.)
          Forget the whole thing.    It's just
          a phase...


INT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

TITLE UP: TWELVE WEEKS AGO.

Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the
kitchen table.

                    MONA
          You don't want kids.    Trust me.

                    ZOE
          Easy for you to say.    You have
          four.

                    MONA
          Yeah, and it's awful.

Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming.
A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          They've ruined my life.

                       ZOE
          Come on...
                                                   5.


                    MONA
          Have you seen my vagina?

Zoe shakes her head.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          Do you want to?

Zoe shakes her head again.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          I would do that for you. To prove
          to you that you don't want to have
          kids, I will show you my vagina.

                    ZOE
          I don't want to see your vagina.    I
          want a baby. My own baby.

                    MONA
          Is it possible you're just a little
          lonely? You know, you haven't met
          the right guy and--

                    ZOE
          It's not about a guy. I don't need
          a guy. I don't even think I want a
          guy at this point. I've dated a
          hundred guys in the last five
          years, and not one of them is even
          close to being the one. How long
          am I supposed to wait?

                    MONA
          You never know. He could be right
          around the corner.

                    ZOE
          Well, then he's late. And I hate
          people who are late. And what if
          he's not right around the corner?
          What if he's miles away?

Zoe shakes her head.   She becomes very serious.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I want to have a baby. And time is
          running out. I hear a clock
          ticking every time I close my eyes.
          I need it to stop.

We hear a loud DING.
                                                            6.


INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

Zoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room.      She looks
at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.

                        ZOE
          Ding.

Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it
away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears.
Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          How the fuck am I supposed to get
          down from here?


INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER

Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly
together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris
passes.

                    DR. HARRIS
          You don't have to walk like that.

                        ZOE
          Oh.   Okay.

Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Should we hug? We might have just
          made a baby together.


INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still
pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her
own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this
exclusive baby club.

                        ZOE
          Hi.

                        PREGNANT WOMEN
          Hi.


INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a
BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...
                                                            7.


                      ZOE
          Hi.

                      WOMAN
          Hi.

The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby
with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.

                    WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You're starting to freak me out.

                      ZOE
          Sorry.

Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look.

                      WOMAN
          Stop it.


EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
their heads.

Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.

A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.

                      ZOE
          Hi!

Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
miraculously, spies a cab.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Taxi!

She runs (little steps) across the street.


INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe closes the door behind her.

                    ZOE
          Hallelujah!
                                                          8.


As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices
someone entering the cab from the other side.

This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --
faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.

                    STAN
          You own it?

                    ZOE
          No, but I'm about to rent it.

                    STAN
          Actually, if we're being technical,
          you kind of stole it.

                    ZOE
          I don't think so.

                    STAN
          If you see someone about to get in
          a cab, you can't just run in from
          the other side and say it's yours.

                    ZOE
          I didn't see you.

                    STAN
          I saw you see me.

                    ZOE
              (to the cabbie)
          Sir, who saw you first?

The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.

                    STAN
          Maybe you're not from around here,
          but there's a code. It's like war,
          even though it's brutal and bloody,
          there are still certain rules we--

                     ZOE
          Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.

Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          But not because you're right, but
          because I am in a terrific mood,
          and you are ruining it.
                                                          9.


                     STAN
          No.   I'll get out.

They each get out.


EXT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the
POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.

                       ZOE
          Now what?

                    STAN
          I don't know. You tell me.

That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.

                     ZOE
          What? Where's he going?!
              (waving her hands, then)
          Come back!

They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Well, that was stupid. Why'd you
          get out, you, stupid-head?

                     STAN
          You said you were in a great mood
          and I was ruining it. I felt bad.
              (then)
          Did you just call me stupid-head?

Zoe storms off with her little steps.


INT. 68TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time.

They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all
the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab
department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above.

                       ZOE
          Oh, man...

                    STAN
          How's your great mood now?
                                                           10.


INT. 6 TRAIN - DAY

A packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed
together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper.

                    STAN
          How `bout now?

                    ZOE
          Please stop talking to me.


INT. UNION SQUARE SUBWAY STATION - DAY

Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each
other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious.

                    STAN
          So, why are you in such a good mood
          anyway?

They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and
the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet
and has a magical quality.

                    ZOE
          Not that it's any of your business,
          but...good things are happening to
          me.

Stan is moved by this.   What a thing to say.

                    STAN
          That's nice. I hope it continues.

                    ZOE
          Thanks. Well, have a nice life.
          Try not to steal any more cabs.

                    STAN
          You do the same.

They nod and separate.


INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY

Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store
filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits.

Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind
legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.
                                                         11.


                    ZOE
          Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?

She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina
hottie, and Bobby run from the back.

                    BOBBY
          Oh, my God, you're glowing.
              (to Jalisa)
          She's glowing, right?

                     JALISA
          Glowing.   Tell us everything.

                    BOBBY
          Everything.

                    ZOE
          There's not much to tell.

                    BOBBY
          You just got shot up with a wad of
          red-headed-freckle sperm. There's
          something to tell.

                    JALISA
          He had red hair and freckles?

                    BOBBY
          I tried to talk her out of it.

                    JALISA
          Why'd you do that, Mami?

                    BOBBY
              (to Jalisa)
          I know, right?

                       JALISA
          Red pubes.     Eek...

                    ZOE
          I'm never going to see his pubes!

                    BOBBY
          You'll see your kid's pubes.

                    ZOE
          I doubt it.

                    BOBBY
          But you'll know they're there.
                                                          12.


                    ZOE
          What is wrong with you?

                    JALISA
          So, what happened?    Come on...

                    ZOE
          I lay down, put my feet up, five
          minutes later it was over. I
          barely felt a thing.

                    BOBBY
          Sounds like Ricardo.

                    JALISA
          Tell me about it, Papi.

Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe.

                    BOBBY
          So...what happens now?

                    ZOE
          Now, we wait.

                    BOBBY
          That's no fun, I want to know if
          I'm going to be a fairy godmother.

                    ZOE
          We'll just have to wait and see.

Zoe smiles and heads for the back.


EXT. HUDSON PETS - NIGHT

The lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe,
Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.

                    BOBBY
          Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can
          have an O'Dhouls or something.

                    JALISA
          We'll go to the piano bar and get
          Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.

                    BOBBY
          Forget it, she's not coming. I can
          tell by the dull look on her face.

                      ZOE
          Love you.
                                                         13.


They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
singing.

                    BOBBY/JALISA
          I saw the sign and it opened up my
          eyes, I saw the sign...

Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears
from the shadows.

                     STAN
          Hi.

                     ZOE
          Aahhh!

Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          You scared the hell out of me!

                     STAN
          Oh, wow.   Is he...okay?

Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets
him upright.

                    ZOE
          What are you doing here?

                    STAN
          I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare
          you. Or hurt your dog. Don't
          worry, I'm not a stalker.

                    ZOE
          How'd you know I worked here?

                    STAN
          I followed you after the subway.
              (thinks, then)
          That sounds a little stalkery, huh?

                     ZOE
          Yeah.

                     STAN
          I just really wanted to see you
          again. Almost like I had to see
          you again. Can I walk you home?
              (then)
          Is it me or does everything I say
          make me sound more like a stalker?
                                                        14.


Zoe allows a small smile.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Can I just give you my card? Here.
          Take my card. I'm not a freak.
          Really. I sell cheese.

This hangs out there for a beat.

                    ZOE
          Cheese?

                    STAN
          Yeah. My family has a goat farm.
          We make cheese. You like cheese?

                    ZOE
          I guess. I've never really thought
          about it.

                     STAN
          Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us
          at the Farmer's market? Come by
          sometime and you can taste my
          cheese.
              (then)
          Okay, I'm going to go. This has
          not gone as planned.

Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.

                    ZOE
          Bye.

Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.


EXT. WEST VILLAGE BROWNSTONE - MORNING

Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and
a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is
beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.
Zoe opens her eyes.

After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts
up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out
as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.
                                                        15.


INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY

Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small,
East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a
child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.

This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL,
40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.

                    CAROL
          Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.

                       EVERYONE
          Hi, Zoe.

                    CAROL
          Welcome to Single Mother's By
          Choice. As the name suggests, we
          are all single mothers by choice.
          Some of us have adopted, some
          conceived with a donor, every story
          is different, but with the same
          common denominator. We wanted to
          have a child, and we didn't need a
          partner to make it happen.

The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense,
somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut,
turns to Zoe.

                    LORI
          Are you a doer or a tryer?

                       ZOE
          Excuse me?

                    LORI
          Are you already a single mother or
          are you trying to become one?

                     ZOE
          Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just
          inseminated a few days ago.
              (then)
          Inseminated...makes me feel like a
          cow or something.

                     CAROL
          Well, when we don't have partners
          with penises, we do what we've got
          to do, right?
              (then)
          So, tell us a little bit about
          yourself.
                                                       16.


                    ZOE
          Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet
          store on Hudson Street. Dogs,
          cats, rabbits...no birds, they
          creep me out. Before that, I
          worked for Google, which I
          completely hated. One day, I
          decided life was too short, and,
          against my accountant's advice, I
          quit Google, cashed out and bought
          the pet store. Now I'm really
          happy on the work front, but I
          still haven't found, you know, the
          one.

                     CAROL
          Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."

                    ZOE
          I always imagined I'd be married
          with kids by now, but it doesn't
          look like it's going to happen that
          way. So, time for Plan B.

                    CAROL
          Society tells us we're supposed to
          find that special person to make us
          happy and complete. But guess
          what...you have to create your own
          happiness. You don't need someone
          to complete you, some...man. You
          already are complete.

                    LORI
          Amen, sister.

                    CAROL
          If you want to have a baby, we here
          at Single Mothers By Choice can be
          your partners. We will be your
          emotional rocks.

Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the
one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an
even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl
covered in tatoos. And several more...

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          From inception to college
          graduation and everything in
          between. We're here for each
          other.

Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.
                                                        17.


                    SARA
          Dakota was actually born right here
          in this very room. Right where
          you're sitting, actually.

                    ZOE
              (uncomfortable)
          Really? Right here?      Imagine that.

                    SARA
          Best day of my life.

                    ZOE
          And how old is she now?

Dakota looks up from the breast.

                       DAKOTA
          I'm three.


INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY

Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of
pastries and a pot of coffee.

                    MONA
          Why did you join a support group of
          unattractive, militant lesbians
          when you have me?

                    ZOE
          Because you're really not that
          supportive.

                       MONA
          Sure I am.

                    ZOE
          You just told me that if I breast-
          feed "my girls" will end up looking
          like empty tube socks.

                    MONA
          I'm just being honest. And don't
          even get me started on what
          childbirth does to your bladder.

                    ZOE
          What does it do to your bladder?

Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly.
                                                      18.


                    MONA
          I just peed a little bit.

                    ZOE
          I don't think I'm pregnant. The
          doctor says it will probably take
          several tries. Something about
          frozen sperm being lazy.

                     MONA
          Good.   Take your time.

Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.

                    ZOE
          So, should I call this guy?   Do you
          think that would be weird?

                    MONA
          Do I think it's weird that you're
          pursuing someone at the exact
          moment in time that you might be
          most unavailable? No. Because
          that's what you do. You sabotage.

                    ZOE
              (ignoring her)
          He works at the Farmer's market.
          And it's right around the corner.
          Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

                    MONA
          I look fat and old?

                      ZOE
          No.

                      MONA
          Then, no.

                    ZOE
          Let's go spy on him. Come on. It
          will be fun. Like high school.

                    MONA
          I can't.
              (checks watch)
          This twenty minute breakfast
          concludes my "me" time for the
          week. More proof that you should
          not have kids.
                                                          19.


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY

The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.

Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She
looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.

                      ZOE
          Oh, well.

She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around.

As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
He's playing banjo.

Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.

                    OLIVIA
          Can I help you?

                    ZOE
              (distracted)
          No, I'm fine.

Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
looking at Stan.

                    OLIVIA
          Tasty, huh?

Zoe nods and takes another berry.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
          Bet you could just eat him up in
          one bite, right?

Zoe now turns, confused.

                      ZOE
          What?

                    OLIVIA
          And don't look now, but he's coming
          this way.
                                                            20.


Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
slung over his shoulder.

                     STAN
          A-ha! I didn't scare you away
          after all.

                     ZOE
               (trying to be casual)
          I was just in the neighborhood. I
          thought I'd come by and get some
          blueberries. I'm going to make a
          pie.

                    STAN
          I love blueberry pie.

Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.

                    ZOE
          I'm confused. I thought you made
          cheese or something.

                    STAN
          What makes you think I don't?

                    ZOE
          I don't know, you're over there
          playing the banjo.

                    STAN
          Can't someone do both?

                    ZOE
          Honestly, I didn't know anyone did
          either.

Olivia returns.

                    OLIVIA
          Aren't you going to introduce me to
          your new friend?

                    STAN
          Nope.
              (to Zoe)
          Come on. Let me show you around.

Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away.   Olivia
watches them go with her arms crossed.
                                                        21.


EXT. THE LITTLE GOAT CHEESE STAND - LATER

Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.

                    STAN
          This is our basic chevre, probably
          our best seller. The cheese that
          started it all, as they say. Then
          over here we have our surface-
          ripened cheeses. These are the
          aged/raw milk cheeses.
              (realizing)
          This is really boring, huh?

                    ZOE
          No, not at all.

                    STAN
          It's like you're in a foreign
          country and the only thing to watch
          on tv is a documentary on cheese.
          You don't want to watch it, but
          somehow you can't stop...

                    ZOE
              (laughing)
          I think it's interesting.    Really.

                    STAN
          All right, you asked for it...
              (boring voice)
          The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
          from raw milk and then aged for
          four to six months. Sometimes
          more. Sometimes less. Usually
          more. Depends on the cheese.

                     FRED
          Stop.   You're killing me.

FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks
up from behind the counter.

                     STAN
          Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.
              (then)
          She's the one I followed from the
          subway the other day like a total
          psychopath.

                    FRED
          Right...I heard about you.
                                                       22.


                    ZOE
          I don't know whether to be
          flattered or terrified.

                       FRED
          Be afraid.

                    STAN
          Don't scare her away.   I'm trying
          to redeem myself.

                    FRED
          Then you should put down the banjo.
          You look like a doofus.

                    STAN
          Doofus?
              (then, to Zoe)
          Do you think I look like a doofus?

                    ZOE
          I don't really know what a doofus
          looks like.

Fred points to Stan.

                    STAN
          Okay. If I put the banjo down, can
          I take you to lunch or something?

                    ZOE
          I should really get back to work.

                    STAN
          Come on, say the word and we can
          have a six-course tasting menu at
          Union Square Cafe. I know the
          chef.

                    ZOE
          That sounds nice, but, I should
          probably go.

                    STAN
          Well, can I call you?

Zoe smiles.


INT. HUDSON PETS - DAY

Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As
soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost
her.
                                     23.


          BOBBY
Okay, spill it.

          JALISA
Who is he? What does he do?    How
do we know him?

          ZOE
What are you talking about?

          JALISA
Stan from the Farmer's Market?
He's called twice already.

           ZOE
Really?

          BOBBY
Is he a farmer? Because that's not
okay.

           ZOE
No.   He makes cheese.

          BOBBY
He's a pilgrim?

           ZOE
I don't know what he is. He's cute
and different and plays the banjo.
    (then)
I think I like him.

          BOBBY
What about the, you know, bun in
the oven?

          ZOE
I really doubt I'm pregnant.

          JALISA
You want to be pregnant. You don't
want to be pregnant. I'm confused.

           ZOE
I want to be pregnant. Of course I
want to be pregnant. I mean, I put
a lot of thought into this, right?
    (then)
So what did Stan say?

          BOBBY
He says to name any restaurant you
want to go to.
          (MORE)
                                                        24.

                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
          He'll be there with bells on.
              (then)
          He didn't say the "bells on" part.
          I added that. Sounds a little too
          gay, though, so I take it back.


EXT. 8TH STREET - NIGHT

Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.


INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - NIGHT

Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs
in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.

                    STAN
          We could have gone anywhere.

                    ZOE
          Just take a bite.   You'll see.

                    STAN
          Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...

                    ZOE
          Gray's Papaya.   Cheers.

She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Good, right?

Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          You've lived here your whole life
          and never been to Gray's Papaya.
          What's wrong with you?

                    STAN
          I actually haven't lived here my
          whole life. We moved out of the
          city when my parents bought the
          farm....not died, but actually
          bought a farm and moved upstate.

                    ZOE
          That must have been a nice place to
          grow up. On a farm.
                                                         25.


                    STAN
          What about your family?

                     ZOE
          It's just me and my grandmother.
          She lives in a retirement community
          in Queens.
              (an awkward beat)
          My parents died when I was young.

                    STAN
          I'm so sorry.

There is a long silence.   They both stare at the hot dogs.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I don't know what to say now.    I've
          made it all awkward and sad.

                     ZOE
          It's okay.
              (then)
          My dad was kind of a bad guy,
          anyway.

                     STAN
          Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          No, come on, we'll get all this
          stuff out of the way so we never
          have to talk about it again. Let's
          ask all the awkward, get-to-know-
          you questions right now.

                     STAN
          Okay.   Good idea.

                    ZOE
          Let's see...are you religious?

                     STAN
          Nope.   What about you?

                     ZOE
          No.

                    STAN
          Have you ever been married?

                     ZOE
          No.
                                                         26.


                      STAN
            Aren't you sick of going to
            weddings?

                      ZOE
            If I have to listen to one more
            couple write their own vows...

                      STAN
            I hate when they write their own
            vows!

They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a
connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay
together, feeling the charge between them.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            What about kids?

Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks.   Like everyone there
must now be looking at her.

                      ZOE
            What about them?

                      STAN
            Well, do you want them?

                       ZOE
            Yeah.   I want kids.

She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real.
She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
            Do you?

                       STAN
            Yeah.   Absolutely.

Zoe nods.   Slowly, she starts to breathe again.


EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT

They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.

                      ZOE
            Okay, first kiss...

                      STAN
            Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She
            wore a head-gear. What about you?
                                                           27.


                    ZOE
          Summer camp. I think his name was--

Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full
of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          That was way better.

                    STAN
          When can I see you again?

Zoe feels her heart jump.    She kisses him again.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her.    The
sun is shining and they are both waking up.

She gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her
nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight
look of concern on her face.


INT. EQUINOX - DAY

Zoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines.
Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all.

                    ZOE
          What if I'm pregnant?

                    MONA
          Then you'll get fat and hormonal
          and I'll say, "I told you so."

                     ZOE
          But what if this could go somewhere
          with Stan? Like, really go
          somewhere.

                    MONA
          Then it will work out perfectly.

                    ZOE
          What do you mean?

                    MONA
          Because just when you really like
          him, you'll break up because you're
          pregnant and then you never have to
          put yourself out there and possibly
          get hurt. That's your dream.
                                                        28.


                    ZOE
              (thinks, then)
          I'm not pregnant.

She gets off the machine.


INT. EQUINOX STEAM ROOM - DAY

We are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other
WOMEN.

                    MONA
          So, when are you seeing him again?

                     ZOE
          Tonight.

                    MONA
          Well, don't have sex with him.
          That's the last thing we need. You
          get knocked up and we'll have no
          idea who the father is.

A few women look over.

                    MONA (CONT'D)
          And then we'll have to do a
          paternity test. Is it the cheese
          farmer or the red-pubed bandit?

More women look over.

                    ZOE
          I'm not going to have sex with him
          tonight. It's too soon.
              (for the women's benefit)
          I'm not a slut.

                    MONA
          Well, bring condoms, just in case.
              (thinks, then)
          And a pregnancy test.

                    ZOE
          Very funny.

                    MONA
          I'm not joking.

All of the women are now staring at Zoe.

                    ZOE
          I'm really not a slut.
                                                              29.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands.
Nuts is beside her. He looks up at her.

                    ZOE
          There's no way, right?


INT. ZOE'S BATHEROOM - NIGHT

Zoe pees on the stick.   Nuts is beside her, watching with his
head tilted.

                    ZOE
          Stop looking at me like that.   I'm
          not pregnant.

Zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test.   Nothing yet.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Come on, come on, come on...

We hear the doorbell RING.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Shit.

Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing.      We wait and
watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Shit!

A faint PLUS SIGN is forming.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Shitshitshitshit...

The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops.
There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          No, shit.

Zoe stands.   Looks at herself in the mirror.   And then...

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Holy fucking shit!
                                                        30.


INT. TAXI - NIGHT

Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the
Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window.

                      STAN
            Are you feeling okay?

Zoe nods.   Her face looks pale.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            Good, because this should really
            be a culinary adventure. This is
            an underground restaurant that
            moves from apartment to apartment,
            depending on the chef.

Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls
the window all the way down and hangs her head out.

                        STAN (CONT'D)
            And some of the guys from the band
            will be there. So, we might get a
            little jam going. Sounds fun,
            right?
                 (then)
            Zoe?

Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the
wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like
a bad dream.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is
making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of
sweat on her forehead.

                      STAN
            And this looks like a mache salad
            with grapes and feta.

He takes some for each of them.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            And this, oh this must be white
            beans and lamb's tongue. You've
            got to have some of this. Etienne
            is famous for his lamb's tongue.

Olivia approaches.
                                                          31.


                    OLIVIA
          Hey, stranger.

                    STAN
          Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe.

                    OLIVIA
          Right. How'd that blueberry pie
          turn out?

                      ZOE
          What?

                    OLIVIA
          You bought blueberries from me?
          Said you were going to make a pie?

                    ZOE
          Um, can you excuse me for a second?

Zoe hurries off.   Olivia watches her go.   Eyes narrowing.

                    OLIVIA
          No way she knows how to bake a pie.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone.

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                     BOBBY (O.S.)
          What?!   Where are you? I'm on my
          way.

                      ZOE
          Brooklyn.

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          Where's that?

Zoe hangs up the phone.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe is now on the phone with Mona.

                    MONA (O.S.)
          Don't panic. Could be a false
          positive. Take another test.
                                                          32.


                    ZOE
          I can't. I'm at some underground
          foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am
          I gonna--

Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore.


INT. DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

Zoe runs down the aisle and empties one, two, three...what
the fuck, every pregnancy test into her basket.

Her cell phone RINGS.    It's Bobby.   She picks it up.

                    BOBBY (O.S.)
          Okay, I'm looking at a subway map.
          Which way is Brooklyn?

She hangs up again.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag
hidden under her arm. Stan comes up behind her.

                    STAN
          Where have you been?

Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill
out onto the floor. She quickly scoops everything back in.

                     ZOE
          Sorry.   You scared me.

                    STAN
          Did you just go to the store?

                    ZOE
          Yeah, I had a little emergency. I
          have a, a, um...corn, and I needed
          to get those little...corn pads.

                       STAN
          Corn pads?

                    ZOE
          I know, it's gross. Do you know
          where the bathroom is?

Zoe walks off leaving him to ponder.
                                                        33.


                    STAN
          What's a corn pad?


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Zoe pees on eight sticks at once.

                      ZOE
          Corn pad?    What the hell is wrong
          with you?

Someone KNOCKS on the door.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Corn pad.    Jesus Christ.

The knocking turns to an angry BANGING.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Relax! I'll be out in...
              (checks box)
          Three to five minutes.

Zoe holds up the tests. One by one, the little windows all
show PLUS SIGNS and CHECK MARKS and DOUBLE HASH MARKS.


INT. UNDERGROUND RESTAURANT/SMALL APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on
her face. By the bar, she sees a PREGNANT WOMAN sipping a
glass of wine. She rushes over.

                    ZOE
          Excuse me, are you allowed to drink
          when you're...

Zoe makes hand motions at her belly, but can't say the word.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          You know...

More hand gestures.

                    PREGNANT WOMAN
          Pregnant?
              (off Zoe's nod)
          My doctor says one glass is--

Zoe doesn't wait for her to finish. She rushes the bar,
pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling
a beer.
                                                         34.


Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up.


EXT. BACK PATIO - SAME

Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small
crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called
"Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."

                    STAN
          Who makes me forget all the other
          girls I met, sweet, little Miss
          Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me,
          than she really ought to be, sweet
          little Miss Blue Eyes.

Zoe appears at the door to the patio.   Stan smiles at her
while he sings.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Who's gonna start takin' care of my
          heart, she makes me realize. And
          it's lucky for me and I really want
          to be with...
              (winks at Zoe)
          sweet, little Miss--

Stan's POV as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts
for the bathroom, puking.

                       STAN (CONT'D)
          Blue eyes?


INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,
she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.

                       ZOE
          Ohhhhhhhh.

She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that
must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the
answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,
mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her
eyes.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Please, God...

But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.
                                                         35.


                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          Water, water everywhere, but not a
          drop to...

She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's
done, she holds up the test.

CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in
vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Fuck me.


EXT. PERRY STREET - NIGHT

Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is
practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.

                    STAN
          My singing made you vomit.

                      ZOE
          No.    It's not that.

                    STAN
          Sure, we were a little out of tune,
          but...

                    ZOE
          I really don't feel well.

                    STAN
          Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?

ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.
Zoe's face pales.

                       CAROL
          Zoe?

                       ZOE
          Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...

                    CAROL
          Where have you been?    You haven't
          been coming to any--

                    ZOE
              (cutting her off)
          Right. I know. I've been so busy.
          Next one, I'm there. For sure.
              (then, awkward)
          This is my friend, Stan.
                                                         36.


                     STAN
          Hi.

                    CAROL
              (eyeing Stan suspiciously)
          Hello. Are you two--

                     ZOE
          Late. Yes. We are. We really
          are.
               (pushing Stan along)
          I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.

They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.

                    STAN
          An old...boyfriend?

                    ZOE
          Her name is Carol. We're on
          a...committee together.

They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder
to make sure Carol's gone.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          All right. I have to go to bed
          now. I'll call you, okay?

                     STAN
          Okay.
              (then)
          Hey, I was thinking, if you don't
          have any plans this weekend, maybe
          you'd like to come up to the farm
          and get away for a few days.

                    ZOE
          I'll call you tomorrow.
          Something's not agreeing with me.

                    STAN
          Was it the lamb's tongue?

Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands
there for a beat. He calls after her.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Okay, well...this weekend.   Think
          about it.
                                                         37.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe lies in bed. Nuts sleeps beside her. Zoe stares out the
window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear.

                    ZOE
          What the hell have I done?


EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY

Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens.


INT. SHADYBROOK LOBBY - DAY

The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works
behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of
PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada.

Zoe walks by the front desk.   ANNIE, an employee, looks up.

                     ANNIE
          Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic.

                    ZOE
          I don't know how that's possible.

                    ANNIE
          Something's different. Did you get
          highlights or a spray tan? Your
          face looks like it's...

                    ZOE
          Please don't say glowing.

                     ANNIE
          Yes!   Exactly!


EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER

There is a small group of WOMEN speed walking around the
courtyard. They are fully decked out in jogging suits,
visors and nose shields. The ringleader is NANA, 83, fit and
fabulous.

On the sidelines is ARTHUR, 87, with his walker and big grin,
as he watches the ladies exercise.

                    ZOE
          Morning, Arthur.
                                                        38.


                    ARTHUR
          Hello, my dear!

He struggles to get up.

                    ZOE
          No, no, no, don't get up.

                    ARTHUR
          Good, because I can't get up. Came
          to see my lovely fiance? She's
          looking fine today, let me tell
          you. Fine.

Nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically.

                      ZOE
          Hi, Nana.

                    NANA
          One more mile to go. Do you have a
          minute? Talk to Arthur.

Zoe looks at Arthur who's now watching Nana's ass, nodding.

                    ARTHUR
          That's what I'm talking about.
          Work it.

Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana.


EXT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - LATER

Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies. She mimics the
same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action.

                    NANA
          Do you want a nose guard?   I have
          an extra.

                    ZOE
          No, I'm fine.

                    SHIRLEY
          Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck
          just had another carcinoma removed
          from her nose.

                    ZOE
              (to Nana)
          I kind of need to talk to you.
          Alone.
                                                           39.


Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several
paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.

                    NANA
          Don't worry, they can't hear
          anything anyway.

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                    NANA
              (can't hear her)
          What?

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                       NANA
          What?

                    ZOE
          I'm pregnant.

                    NANA
          I can't hear you, darling.

                    SHIRLEY
          Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant.   Turn
          your hearing aide up.

Zoe closes her eyes.    Nightmare.


INT. NANA'S ROOM - LATER

Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea.   Zoe's eyes well with tears.

                    ZOE
          What am I going to do?

                    NANA
          I'm confused. Isn't this what you
          wanted? You bought sperm and were
          inseminated by your doctor. This
          isn't what we would call an
          accident.

                    ZOE
          But now it's all happening so fast.
          Did I really think this through?
                                       40.


          NANA
We talked about it for months. You
said it was what you wanted more
than anything in the world.

          ZOE
But this guy, he's...special.   It's
all going to fall apart now.

          NANA
What makes him so special?

          ZOE
I don't know. He's very...real.
And funny. And different. The
other guys I've been with all had
their briefcases and their five-
year plans and their secretaries
they were fucking. Stan doesn't
have a five-year plan. I don't
even know if he has a plan.

          NANA
What about a secretary?

           ZOE
Some kid named Fred.
    (then)
I like him, Nana.

          NANA
Well, if he's the right one, he'll
stay.

          ZOE
Do you really think so?

          NANA
Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that
would be enough to appease you.

          ZOE
Should I still visit him for the
weekend? Or should I just vanish
and hope he forgets I ever existed.

          NANA
Don't be silly. Go up there for
the weekend. Spend some time with
him and see what he's really like.

           ZOE
Yeah.   You're right.
                                                            41.


                    NANA
          You might find out he's a total
          douchebag and then the whole thing
          is moot.

Zoe looks at Nana.   Douchebag?


INT. CAR - DAY

Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly
and a bit maniacally.

                    ZOE
          Okay, so we'll just hope that he's
          a douchebag. Could happen, right?

WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat.      He's yawning.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up?

Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          My whole life is falling apart and
          you can't keep your bug-eyes open?
              (yawning)
          Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why
          am I so tired? I slept nine hours.
              (thinks, then)
          And I'm starving, too. What the
          hell is going on?

Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.


INT. GAS STATION MINI MART - DAY

Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station
Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a
smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.

                    ZOE
          Am I even allowed to drink coffee?

The trucker looks at her.    She looks at him.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Do you know anything about being
          pregnant?
                                                          42.


EXT. CAR - LATER

Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
middle of nowhere.


INT. CAR - SAME

Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A
small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar
wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is
in her lap.

Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third
ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a
few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the
little coffee cup.

                    ZOE
          Thanks a lot, decaf.

She picks up the phone.

                    STAN (O.S.)
          Where are you?

Zoe looks around.

                    ZOE
          I have no idea.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY

Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.

Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.

                    ZOE
          He's so not a douchebag.


INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

They enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming
carriage house.

                    ZOE
          I can't believe you live here.
          This is ridiculous.
                                                         43.


                    STAN
          I just come on weekends. My
          parents really live here.

                     ZOE
          Oh.   Where are they now?

                    STAN
          In the kitchen.

Zoe stops short.

                    ZOE
          Wait, they're here? Now? Is this
          a "meet the parents" kind of thing?
          I wasn't prepared for this.

                    STAN
          No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll
          meet them, but--

                     ZOE
          When you said come up for the
          weekend, I assumed it was just us.
              (then)
          I think I need to lay down.


INT. STAN'S BEDROM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her
chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.

                    STAN
          Are you hung-over or something?

                    ZOE
          I'm just...not myself. Give me ten
          minutes. A ten-minute power nap
          and I'm good. I need to regroup.

                     STAN
          Are you sure you're okay?
              (then)
          Zoe? Hello?

But she's already out.   Stan gives her a little poke.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look
up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in-
law.
                                                           44.


                     EDWARD
          Oh.   It's just you.

                    STAN
          She's taking a nap.

                     JOAN
          A nap?   Now? She just got here.

                    STAN
          Mom, I need you to not be
          judgemental, okay. I like this
          girl a lot.

                    JOAN
          How can I be judgemental?    We
          haven't even met her yet.

We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          What the heck is that?

The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls
into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.

                     STAN
          Oh.   This is Nuts.

Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and
then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.

                    JOAN
          Who's judging?!


INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER

It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position.
Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.

                    ZOE
          What was that?

We hear the GRUMBLE again.    It's her stomach.   She puts her
hands over it.

                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          Whoa.

Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag
is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.
                                                         45.


INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.

                    ZOE
              (whispering)
          Stan?

No one in sight.   She waits a beat and then whispers louder.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Stan!


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen.   Nuts is with her.

                      ZOE
          Stan?    Hello?

Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her
stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something
smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the
pot. It's beef stew.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Oh, my God.

She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon.
She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs
a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
              (mouth full)
          Oh, my God.

She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands
there. And stands there some more.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Oh, who am I kidding?

She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This
time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Oh.   My.    God.

Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.
                                                              46.


Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.

And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths
bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows
is she's supposed to be open-minded.

                      JOAN
            Would you like a plate?

Zoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing.

                        JOAN (CONT'D)
            A napkin?

Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.

                        JOAN (CONT'D)
            I'm Joan.

Zoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite.

                      JOAN (CONT'D)
            And you must be Zoe.

Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the
best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.


INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper
and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite
the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.

                      EDWARD
            The stew is delicious, honey.

                      STAN
            Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.

                      EDWARD
                (to Zoe)
            Have you ever in your life had stew
            like this? Come on, be honest.

Zoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret.

                        ZOE
            Uh...no.    Never.
                                                       47.


INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

They are having coffee and dessert in the living room.
Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like
she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.

                      JOAN
            So are all the animals in your pet
            store...differently abled?

                       ZOE
            Oh, you can say paralyzed. He
            doesn't mind.
                (then)
            No, our pets are all in great
            shape. Purebreads mostly, but not
            from puppy mills.

                      JOAN
            Those puppy mills are terrible.    I
            read about them in the paper.

                      ZOE
            Well, that's actually how I ended
            up with Nuts. I bought him from
            this pet store near my house. Six
            months later, I had thousands of
            dollars in vet bills and had to put
            him in a wheelchair.

                      EDWARD
            You should have sued that place.

                      ZOE
            I thought about it, but what was
            that really going to do? They were
            still going to sell inbred dogs.
            So...I took the money I made when I
            left Google and just bought the
            place figuring I would do better.

                      STAN
            You worked for Google?

Zoe nods.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            How could I not know that?

                      ZOE
            You never asked.
                                                        48.


                    STAN
          And you made a lot of money and
          then bought a pet store?

Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I love that.

                    ZOE
          It's been fun. Beats brand
          management, that's for sure.

                    JOAN
              (to Edward)
          That sounds like us, honey.

                     EDWARD
          It's true.
              (to Zoe)
          When we bought this farm we just
          wanted to make cheese because we
          couldn't find anything we liked in
          the stores. And now, twenty years
          later, here we are...

                    JOAN
          Sometimes in life you just have to
          take matters into your own hands.
          Make things happen your own way,
          you know?

Zoe forces a smile.   If only they knew.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - NIGHT

The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm.

Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.

                    STAN
          I can't believe that Nuts has an
          off-road wheelchair.

                    ZOE
          He's got one for snow, too.      With
          little skis on the bottom.

Stan smiles and shakes his head.
                                               49.


                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What?

                    STAN
          You're really something.

                    ZOE
          Are you making fun of me?   Do you
          think I spoil him?

                    STAN
          No, I really think you're amazing.
          I mean, that story you told
          tonight. You just quit your whole
          professional life because of this
          little dog? Started your own
          business, just like that?

Zoe shrugs.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          You're very...unique.

                    ZOE
          Well, you're a dime a dozen. I
          can't tell you how many banjo
          playing, cheese makers I've been
          with.

                    STAN
          I keep waiting for the other shoe
          to drop. Like, how can you be so
          perfect? Why are you even still
          single? I can't believe no one's
          snatched you up by now.

                    ZOE
          I drive them all away, I guess.

                    STAN
          Yeah, right.

Stan takes her in his arms.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Look, I know this is all going
          fast...the time we're spending
          together, meeting my parents and
          everything...but, I'm okay with
          that. I want it to go fast.

                    ZOE
          It is going fast.
                                                         50.


                    STAN
          But isn't that okay? Aren't we old
          enough to skip all the bullshit?
          What are we waiting for? I...want
          to be with you.

Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him.    Before this
goes any further, she has to tell him.

                    ZOE
          Stan.

                    STAN
          Come on. There's something I want
          to show you.


INT. CHEESE CAVE - NIGHT

It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese.
Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.

                    ZOE
          What is it?

                    STAN
          It's cheese.

                    ZOE
          I can see that.

                    STAN
          It's a new kind of goat's milk
          we're using. I've been developing
          the recipe, and now it needs to
          age. It'll be ready for market in
          several months.
              (then, excited)
          Want to know what it's called?

                    ZOE
          Okay.

                    STAN
          Zoe.

                    ZOE
          You named a piece of cheese after
          me?

                    STAN
          Not just one piece. The whole
          line. This will forever in history
          be known as the Zoe.
                    (MORE)
                                                        51.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Unless, of course, it tastes like
          shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
              (with a wink)
          But that'll never happen.

                    ZOE
          How do you know?

                    STAN
          Because it's going to be fantastic.
          Sweet and sassy and very complex.
          Why do you think I'm calling it
          Zoe?

                    ZOE
          No one's ever named a piece of
          cheese after me before.

Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.

                    STAN
          You're kind of hard to read right
          now. You're either seriously
          flattered or totally repulsed.

Zoe smiles.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          What?

                    ZOE
          I want to kiss you right now, but
          it really smells like cheese in
          here.


EXT. DAIRY - MOMENTS LATER

The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy.


INT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and
kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.


INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His
body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there,
looking at him before he jumps on top of her.
                                                          52.


                    ZOE
              (under her breath)
          You're such a douchebag.

                     STAN
          What?

Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. STAN'S ROOM - LATER

They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They
look happy and worn out

Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are
all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.

Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...

                    STAN
          That was amazing. I mean, like,
          totally and exceptionally, over-the-
          top, amazing.

Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.

                     ZOE
          Stan.

                     STAN
          Yeah.

                    ZOE
          There's something I really have to
          tell you.

                    STAN
          There's something I have to tell
          you, too.

Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Can I go first? `Cause if we're
          going to say the same thing, I want
          to say it first.

                    ZOE
          We're not going to say the same
          thing.
                                                            53.


                    STAN
          Well, let me go, because this is
          really embarrassing, and I just
          have to say it.

                      ZOE
          Okay.

                     STAN
          I've dated a lot of women. I mean,
          not tons, but a lot. And, the
          thing is, I've never...been in love
          before. I've never even told
          anyone I love them before. Because
          I just never felt it. But from the
          day we met, from the first time our
          backs accidentally touched in the
          subway, I feel this, this...
              (he shakes his head)
          Maybe this is too much to say right
          now, but...I love you, Zoe. I
          really do.

Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares
at him.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          In my mind, you were supposed to
          say, I love you, too.

Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A
beat later, we hear her vomit.


INT. STAN'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan
enters.

                      STAN
          Zoe?

He looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Why are you crying? Everything's
          perfect.

                      ZOE
          It's not.

                    STAN
          Sure it is.
                                                 54.


Zoe takes a deep breath.

                         STAN (CONT'D)
            What?

                      ZOE
            I'm pregnant.

                      STAN
            Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
            happen that fast.

Zoe shakes her head.

                      ZOE
            I just found out.

                      STAN
            Pregnant? As in you're going to
            have a baby?

Zoe nods.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            I don't understand.

                       ZOE
            I know.   It's hard to explain.

                      STAN
            Well, who's it?

                      ZOE
            I don't know.

                         STAN
            What?

                      ZOE
            I don't know who the father is. I
            kind of know him. I just don't
            know his name exactly. It was sort
            of anonymous.

                         STAN
            Anonymous?

                      ZOE
            He's a donor. From a sperm bank.

                      STAN
            Seriously, what the fuck are you
            talking about? Sperm bank? What?
                                                    55.


                    ZOE
          I know, this is so fucked up.

                    STAN
          When did all of this happen?

                    ZOE
          The day we met. That same day.
          And I didn't tell you because I
          didn't think there was any way I
          could be pregnant.

                       STAN
          But...why?

                    ZOE
          Because supposedly with frozen
          sperm it takes a few tries and...

                    STAN
          No, why would you do this?

                    ZOE
          Because I wanted a baby. And I'm
          almost forty, and I never met the
          right guy. I was afraid if I
          waited any longer it would all pass
          me by, and I'd miss my chance.

Stan just looks at her.       Speechless.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I didn't know you. I would have
          never done it if--

                    STAN
          I just told you I loved you.

                    ZOE
          Well....do you not now?

                    STAN
          You're pregnant.

                    ZOE
          Don't say it like that.

                    STAN
          You're pregnant.

                     ZOE
          Yes.   I'm pregnant.      I'm pregnant!
                                                            56.


                    STAN
          I tell you I'm in love with you and
          you tell me your pregnant with some
          stranger's child?

                    ZOE
          Don't say it like that.     You make
          it sound dirty.

                    STAN
          I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I
          don't know what to say. What the
          fuck am I supposed to say?! This
          is great fucking news?
          Congratulations?! Why did you wait
          so long to tell me?

                    ZOE
          Because I'm freaking out, okay! I
          didn't know what to do. I made
          this big decision to do this and
          then I met you--

                    STAN
          Well, what am I supposed to do now?
          This isn't how it was supposed to
          be. This isn't what--

                    ZOE
          I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life
          isn't perfect. It's not all neat
          and tidy like your perfect family
          and your perfect farm and your
          bluegrass band. It's messy. It's
          fucked up. This is real life,
          okay? I'm sorry to break it to
          you.

They both stand there.    After the raised voices, the silence
feels more pronounced.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

                     STAN
          Sorry?   What's sorry going to do?

Stan walks out. Zoe stands there.     And stands there.   And
then she starts to cry.


INT. STAN'S BEDROOM - LATER

Zoe lies in bed awake.    Nuts is beside her.    They are alone.
                                                           57.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY

It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats
from one pasture to another.


INT. GUEST ROOM - MORNING

Stan lies awake in a small guest room.   Joan enters and is
startled to find him in there.

                     JOAN
          Oh, I thought you were in your
          room. Sorry.
              (then)
          Everything okay?

Stan doesn't answer.   Joan sits on the corner of the bed.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          Well, she seems really terrific.
          Dad and I both think so. She's
          smart and poised and...

Next door, we hear Zoe puking again. Joan stops.   Then,
wanting to seem open-minded, continues.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          And warm and gracious...

Another very LOUD HURL.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          And pretty and...

Another HURL.    Joan looks at Stan.

                    JOAN (CONT'D)
          What the hell's going on in there?

                    STAN
          She's pregnant.

                    JOAN
          Oh, dear God.

We hear the toilet FLUSH.


INT. CAR - DAY

Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition.
Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.
                                                          58.


                    ZOE
          I don't know what to say.

Neither does Stan, who says nothing.    He runs his foot back
and forth in the gravel.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          I guess I'd given up on meeting
          someone like you, and I did what I
          thought was best.

Stan still doesn't say anything.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          But, for what it's worth...I love
          you, too.

She puts the car in gear and pulls out.    Stan watches her go.
His hands in his pockets.


EXT. MONA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.   A
beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.

                       MONA
          Come here.

Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for
a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three
kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down
the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at
the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her
morning ritual.

She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach.    For
the first time, we actually see a little bump.


INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She
looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a
perfect pedicure.

Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.
                                                             59.


                    DR. HARRIS
          Congratulations! What luck to get
          pregnant on the first try, huh?
          And with frozen sperm, too. So,
          how are we feeling?

                    ZOE
              (unconvincing)
          Okay.

                    DR. HARRIS
          You sure about that?

                    ZOE
          It's been hard. I don't know if I
          was really prepared for this.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Well, your hormones aren't helping,
          and going through this without a
          partner must be difficult.

Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the
device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.

                    DR. HARRIS (CONT'D)
          Well, the good news is everything
          looks great. You are now eight
          weeks pregnant, which is an
          important milestone. With a little
          luck, we should be able to see a
          heartbeat today.

On the screen we see a small flickering dot.    Dr. Harris
smiles.

                       ZOE
          That's it?     That's...my baby?

Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe.
Tears fill her eyes.

                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          Hi, Baby.
              (then)
          Is it okay? Is it healthy?

                    DR. HARRIS
          Everything's just...
              (makes a face, then)
          Wait, a minute...

                     ZOE
          What?   Wait a minute, what?
                                                         60.


                    DR. HARRIS
          Well...I see another heartbeat.

                    ZOE
              (freaking out)
          It has two hearts?

                    DR. HARRIS
          No...but you have two babies.

Zoe's mouth falls open.


NT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY

We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting
on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her
head in her hands.

                     CAROL
          Twins!   That's fantastic!

Zoe bursts into tears.

                    LORI
          Why are you crying?   That's so
          lucky.

                     ZOE
          Yup.   That's me.   Lucky, lucky, me.

The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.

                    CAROL
          Are you okay? Is it a financial
          concern? There are many programs--

                     ZOE
          No. I'm fairly loaded, actually.
          Used to work for Google.
               (blows nose)
          I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I
          don't know if I can talk about it
          yet.

                     CAROL
          Take your time. When you feel like
          sharing, we're here for you. We're
          all sisters here.
               (then, to the group)
          Let's give Zoe some space. When
          she's ready to talk, we're ready to
          listen. Deep, cleansing breaths,
          Zoe.
                                                        61.


Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.

                    CAROL (CONT'D)
          Now, in the meantime, does anyone
          else have anything they want to
          discuss? Problems? Concerns?

Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.

                    TABITHA
          I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps
          asking why he doesn't have a daddy,
          and I just don't know what--

                    ZOE
              (blurting out)
          There's this guy. His name is
          Stan. And he's fantastic.

                       CAROL
          I knew it!

                    TABITHA
          Uh...wasn't I just speaking?

                    CAROL
          I knew you were with that guy!

                       SARA
          What guy?

                    LORI
          Zoe, this group is called Single
          Mother's By Choice.

                     ZOE
          I know.   I'm sorry--

                    TABITHA
          Um, excuse me. What about Luca?
          He's been really, really sad.

                    ZOE
              (floodgates opening)
          Have you ever met a guy and you get
          butterflies and you think this is
          the kind of man who could take care
          of me forever? The kind of guy who
          makes you re-examine everything?
          Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home
          mom and be barefoot and pregnant.

The women stare blankly at Zoe.
                                                        62.


                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          He actually lives on a farm! Plays
          the banjo! Maybe I could learn to
          sew and take care of the animals.
          Like Laura Ingalls.

Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.


EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LATER

The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very
awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.

                    ZOE
          Carol, thank you. This has been
          really helpful. Just getting it
          all out and being with other women
          who--

                     CAROL
          I'm going to have to ask you not to
          come back.

                     ZOE
          What?   Why?

                     CAROL
          I don't think we can help you, and,
          quite frankly, you're against
          everything we stand for.

                    ZOE
          But, I thought we were all sisters.

                     CAROL
          No.  Not you.
              (then)
          Do you know how long it took me to
          conceive? Five years. I had three
          miscarriages and spent every last
          dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The
          woman with the short hair?

                       ZOE
          Which one?

                    CAROL
          The one with the really short hair?

                     ZOE
          Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it
          down much.
                                                           63.


                        CAROL
            She   just flew to Memphis to watch
            her   baby being born. Seconds after
            the   birth, the birth mother changed
            her   mind and refused to give it up.

Zoe's face changes.     She starts to get it.

                      CAROL (CONT'D)
            So, as you can see, we are really
            dedicated and choosing to be single
            mothers, and you seem to be in a
            slightly different place. You're
            carrying two healthy babies, and
            you have no idea how lucky you are.

                      ZOE
                (after a beat)
            You're right.

                      CAROL
            I like you, Zoe. We all like you.
            But you kind of need to figure out
            where you are.

Zoe nods.


EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT COMMUNITY - DAY

Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe
looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They
complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.

                      NANA
            That man is obsessed with my ass.

                       ZOE
            I know.   It's kind of upsetting.

                      NANA
            He wants to take me on a cruise so
            that we can finally tie the knot.
            But, I don't know. What's the
            hurry?

                      ZOE
            You've been engaged for nine years.

                      NANA
            No reason to rush into anything.

Nana looks over at Zoe.     She sees the bags under her eyes.
                                                           64.


                    NANA (CONT'D)
          You look terrible, dear.

                    ZOE
          Thanks.

                    NANA
          You must really love him, huh?

                    ZOE
          I guess I do.

                    NANA
          Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and
          I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
          you have put him in a really
          awkward position. Having a baby is
          a big adjustment for any couple.
          And you're not married. And he's
          not the father. And you've only
          been together a little while. And
          now you're having twins. And--

                    ZOE
          Please stop.

                    NANA
          I'm just saying, if he actually
          wanted to stay with you right now,
          he'd be the greatest man in the
          world, and, quite frankly, I don't
          think any man is that great.

They complete another lap around the courtyard.   Arthur
smiles at them and then "raises the roof."

                    NANA (CONT'D)
          Arthur's just about the best man I
          know, and look at him. He's a
          fucking idiot.


EXT. LITTLE GOAT FARM - DAY

Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has
the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look
older. Thinner.

Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.

                    JOAN
          You know, people thought we were
          crazy when we bought this farm.
                    (MORE)
                                                            65.

                       JOAN (CONT'D)
             All of our friends in New York,
             they thought we'd lost our minds.

Stan nods.    We get the feeling he's heard this before.

                       JOAN (CONT'D)
             I guess I'm saying that you may
             have envisioned your life going one
             way, but the reality is, it could
             go a totally different direction.
             You just have to be open to it.

Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.      He
shrugs.

                       STAN
             Having a baby with someone I barely
             know, someone else's baby...it's
             just not how I pictured it.

                       JOAN
             I used to work on Wall Street. Now
             I wear boots covered in goat shit.
             This isn't how I pictured it,
             either. But guess what...I'm
             happy.

She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.


INT. STAN'S BEDROM - NIGHT

Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars." There's even
less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over
to try and sleep.

ANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room.
Stan looks at it and can't help but smile.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other
on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears.

Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is
growing. For the first time, we see a smile.


INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - DAY

The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their
usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.
                                                        66.


                    LORI
          Make sure you put your numbers
          down. I want to have everyone's
          number handy in case I go into
          labor early.

Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.

                      ZOE
          Hi, guys.

No one knows what to say.

                      CAROL
          Hi, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          I just wanted to apologize. I'm
          sorry I got into a relationship and
          wasn't honest with you guys, and
          I'm sorry I interrupted you,
          Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing
          better.

                      TABITHA
          Thanks.

                     ZOE
              (to Carol)
          And I've thought a lot about what
          you said, about how lucky I am. I
          got into this whole situation
          because I wanted to have a baby.
          And, somehow, I lost sight of that.
              (then)
          Anyway, I need partners in this,
          and I hope you'll take me back.

Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What's this?

                    LORI
          It's a phone tree. I'm due next
          month, but my midwife thinks I may
          go sooner. I want everyone to be
          there. Are you in?

Zoe smiles.

                      ZOE
          I'm in.
                                                           67.


EXT. HUDSON STREET - DAY

Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as
far as it will go.

A WOMAN with a double stroller approaches.   Zoe smiles.

                    ZOE
          Hi.

                    WOMAN
          Hi.

                    TWIN TODDLERS
          Hi./Hi.

Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and
smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As
she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar
voice.

                    STAN
          Hi.

Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection.     For
a brief second, they look like a family.

Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or
what. They just stand there.

                    ZOE
          Hi.

                    STAN
          Hi.

                    ZOE
          You said that already.

                    STAN
          You...look great.

Zoe touches her belly.    Proud but protective.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          How are you feeling?

                    ZOE
          Okay.

                    STAN
          Good.

A long silence.
                                                        68.


                      ZOE
            You have a beard.

                      STAN
            Yeah, it's awful isn't it.

                      ZOE
            No.

                       STAN
            Don't lie.
                (then)
            Did I tell you how pretty you look?

Zoe nods.   Another silence.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            I miss you.

A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push
up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This
separation makes the moment all the more tense.

                      ZOE
            I miss you, too.

                      STAN
            This whole time we've been apart,
            I've been trying to figure out what
            it is about you that I love so
            much. And I think that it's that a
            lot of people talk about doing
            things, but you actually do them.
            You're really kind of daring. How
            you quit your job and took over a
            pet store all because some asshole
            sold you a lame dog. You came and
            found me at the Farmer's Market
            even though the night before I
            acted like a total stalker...

Zoe smiles at the memory.      Stan continues.

                      STAN (CONT'D)
            And now you're pregnant. Because
            you wanted to have a baby and
            didn't think you could wait any
            longer. Well, that's just the same
            kind of thing. It's...brave. And
            I can't love you for being that way
            but then walk away for the same
            reason.

Stan takes her hands.
                                                          69.


                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I love you. I've been waiting my
          whole life for you. And I can't
          let one little baby get in the way
          of that. I just...can't.

                    ZOE
          There's something I need to tell
          you.

                       STAN
          Okay.

                    ZOE
          It's big. And you're allowed to
          take all of this back when I tell
          you.

                       STAN
          What.

                    ZOE
          It's not just one baby....I'm
          having twins.

Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.

And then, Zoe starts laughing too.   The whole thing is just
so ridiculous.

                    STAN
          This is insane.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to
face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the
little bump, new since he's last been with her.

                    STAN
          Do you feel any kicking?

                       ZOE
          Sometimes.

                    STAN
          What does it feel like?

                    ZOE
          Like butterflies.
                                                                 70.


Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her
belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Are you really sure you want to do
          this?

                       STAN
          Yeah.     I'm really sure.

They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes
her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as
she dozes off.


INT. EXAM - ROOM

CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes
floating head-to-toe.

Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan
doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement.

                    ZOE
          Are you okay?

                    STAN
          They're so...perfect.      They look
          like real babies.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Would you like to know the sexes?

They look at each other.      Zoe smiles.   Stan shrugs.   Zoe
nods. Stan does, too.

                       ZOE
          Yes.     Tell us.

                    DR. HARRIS
          You're having two healthy little
          girls.

Stan gets tears in his eyes.

                       STAN
          Two girls?

                       ZOE
          Two girls.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Congratulations.
                                                         71.


EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW
YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to
meetings, or fighting for cabs.

But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so
often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing.
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the
street.

                       STAN
          Two girls!

A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by.   Stan smiles.
Now he's part of this exclusive club.

                       STAN (CONT'D)
          Hi.

                       WOMAN
          Hi.


INT. UNION SQUARE CAFE - NIGHT

We PAN past several small plates of food on a table.   A chef
tells us what delectable items we are looking at.

                    CHEF
          Here we have a yellowtail sashimi
          with ponzu sauce and pea shoots.
          This is carpaccio with shaved white
          truffles. And, finally, an
          heirloom tomato salad with fresh
          Buratta flown in from Italy this
          morning.

                    STAN
          Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.

Sam tops off their champagne and exits.   Stan picks up his
fork and starts eating. Zoe does not.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Aren't you hungry?

                    ZOE
          I can't eat any of this.

                       STAN
          Why not?
                                                           72.


                    ZOE
              (pointing to each dish)
          Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized.
              (re: champagne)
          Alcohol.

                    STAN
          Let me get Sam back. He'll make
          you anything you want.

                    ZOE
          I don't want to hurt his feelings.
          You go ahead. I'm fine.

                    STAN
          Well, what are you going to eat?


INT. MCDONALD'S - NIGHT

The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order.

                    CASHIER
          Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with
          cheese, four large fries, and a six
          piece chicken McNuggets?

                     ZOE
          Make that an eight, no, ten-piece
          McNuggets.
              (to Stan)
          You'll have some, right?

                    STAN
          No.

                    ZOE
              (back to the cashier)
          Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.

Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to
Expect when You're Expecting."

Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget
in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan
watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion.
                                                        73.


                    ZOE
              (re: book)
          Have you gotten to page 79 yet?

                    STAN
          No. I stopped reading when you
          ripped out one of my pages and used
          it as a napkin.

                    ZOE
          Says here many women in the second
          trimester experience an increased
          sexual appetite.

                     STAN
          Really?

Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget.
She takes a seductive bite.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Are you coming on to me? It's kind
          of hard to tell right now.

                     ZOE
          Yeah.   I'm coming on to you.

Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of
him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss
him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops.

                     ZOE (CONT'D)
          What?

                    STAN
          You have chicken in your hair.


INT. EQUINOX GYM - DAY

Zoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going
very fast, while Mona is barely going at all.

                    MONA
          Why are you even working out? This
          is the one time in your life you're
          allowed to let it go.

                    ZOE
          Because look at me. I just keep
          getting bigger and bigger.
                                                          74.


                    MONA
          Well, yeah. That's kind of how it
          goes.

                    ZOE
          I'm afraid I'm going to scare him
          away. I'm like one of those giant
          bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to
          take over the whole back yard.

                     MONA
          Come on.   He loves you for you.

                    ZOE
          I'm just getting kind of freaked
          out by everything. He asked me to
          go to this wedding with him. What
          kind of first impression am I going
          to make on all of his friends?

                    MONA
          Well, you're knocked up with some
          stranger's twins. So, already
          you're not exactly...

                    ZOE
          Not helping.

                    MONA
          Do you have anything to wear at
          least?


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the
closet.

                    STAN
          Everything okay in there?

A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          Never mind.

He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.

                    ZOE (O.S.)
          This SUCKS!!!

                    STAN
          Honey, whatever you wear is fine.
                                                           75.


                    ZOE (O.S.)
          I don't have anything to wear!
          That's the problem.

Another dress sails through the air.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
          Fuuuuuuck!

                    STAN
          You always look great. I've never
          seen you not look great.

Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black
dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          That's perfect. You look hot.

                      ZOE
          Really?    You think?

Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper
are ten inches apart.

                    STAN
          Do you have a shawl or something?

Zoe bursts into tears.


EXT. PERRY STREET - LATER

A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the
door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While
it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.

                    STAN
          You look smokin'.

                    ZOE
          Thanks, honey.

Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.

                       STAN
          Let's go.     We're super late.

She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight.
Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around,
but again, the dress is too tight.

                       ZOE
          Hmmmm...
                                                           76.


                    STAN
          Why don't you sort of go in...head
          first and then turn around.

Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.

                    ZOE
          Shut up and push me.

                      STAN
          Push you?

                    ZOE
          Just do it.

Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab.


INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board.

                    ZOE
          I hate everyone.

She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she
bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into
tears again.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - LATER

We PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben
and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough (half eaten,) US Weekly,
and The National Enquirer.

Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling.

                    ZOE
          Do you think he's telling everyone
          why I didn't go? I'm too much of a
          fat-ass walrus to go to the
          wedding?

                    BOBBY
          You're not a fat ass walrus.
          You're pregnant.

Zoe eyes well up with tears again.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Why are you crying? So what?   You
          missed a stupid wedding.
                    (MORE)
                                               77.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          You got to have girls' night with
          me. This is way more fun.

                    ZOE
          I don't know. I'm just so
          emotional lately. It's the
          hormones.

                    BOBBY
          You can't help it. Being pregnant
          sucks. You're emotional, and
          irrational, and you get back fat.

                    ZOE
          I have back fat?

                     BOBBY
          No.  I'm just kidding.
              (then)
          Okay, yes. You have back fat.

Zoe feels her back.

                    ZOE
          How's Stan going to stay with me
          through this? I'm disgusting.

                    BOBBY
          We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll
          get some hip maternity clothes...
          whatever that means.

                    ZOE
          Look at me, Bobby.

                      BOBBY
          What?

                    ZOE
              (pinching back fat)
          Look at me. What do you see?

                    BOBBY
          I see the most amazingly wonderful
          person I know.

Zoe smiles.   Tears come to her eyes again.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          With back fat.
                                                        78.


INT. PUCK BUILDING - NIGHT

Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand. He is
watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker,
Fred, on the dance floor. Everyone looks drunk and happy.

Olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne.

                    OLIVIA
          Why aren't you dancing?

                    STAN
          I'm just about to go.    It's late.

                    OLIVIA
          Come on, one dance.

The spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder.
Stan notices. She steps in closer.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          For old time's sake.

                    STAN
          I have a girlfriend, Olivia.

                    OLIVIA
          Never stopped you before.

She tries to kiss him.    Stan steps away.

                    STAN
          It's serious this time.

Olivia pulls back, surprised.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Zoe is asleep in the bed. Her bump looks very cute under the
covers. Stan quietly gets ready for bed. She turns to him,
half asleep.

                    ZOE
          How was it?

                    STAN
          Boring.

                    ZOE
          Good.

Stan gets in bed next to her.   Zoe scoots into him.
                                      79.


          ZOE (CONT'D)
I miss my old ass.

             STAN
Excuse me?

          ZOE
It was one of my best features.

          STAN
You know what's weird?   I never
knew your old ass.

          ZOE
It's kind of like this ass but way
hotter.

          STAN
I also don't know what you really
like to eat and what's just a
craving, or when you start laughing
hysterically and then crying and
you say, this isn't me, if that's
true because I don't really know
the real you. All I know is the
pregnant you.

          ZOE
That is weird.

          STAN
Or like how you're horny all the
time? Is that you? Or is that
pregnant you?

           ZOE
    (lying)
That's me.

          STAN
When all of this is over, who will
you be?

          ZOE
Hopefully, myself again.

          STAN
But...who is that?
                                                           80.


INT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - LATER

The clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. Stan is snoring
slightly. Nuts is on the pillow beside him. Zoe's side is
empty.


INT. ZOE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a
box of photographs.

We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As
Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph.

His P.O.V.    It's a picture of a woman's ass.

                       ZOE
             This is my old ass.

Stan blinks a few times.      His eyes adjusting.

                       STAN
             Why do you have a picture of your
             ass?

                       ZOE
             My college boyfriend took it. So,
             I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't
             look exactly like this anymore, but
             it's pretty close. It's held up.

                       STAN
             It's a nice ass.

                       ZOE
             You said you don't know the real
             me, so I thought I'd show you.

She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at
twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and
acne.

                       ZOE (CONT'D)
             This is me in seventh grade.

Stan props himself up in one elbow.

                       STAN
             Wow.

                       ZOE
             I know.
                                                        81.


                    STAN
          You look like Anthony Michael Hall.

                     ZOE
          This period, as horrible as it was,
          made me who I am. I think every
          person should go through a
          hideously ugly phase. It builds
          character.
              (then)
          It also taught me that I should
          never, under any circumstances,
          have short hair and a perm again.

She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and
Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around Nana.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          This   is one of my favorites because
          look   how happy I am. I don't even
          know   what place yellow is, but I'm
          sure   it's not good.

                    STAN
          Fifth place.

                    ZOE
          But I still look super happy,
          right? That's all because of Nana.
          Whatever I did, she thought it was
          the best.

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe.
Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
regular clothes.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          These are my best friends, Bobby
          and Mona. Mona and I met in high
          school and Bobby passed out on my
          couch in college and never left.
          You haven't met them yet because
          they might scare you away.

                    STAN
          Why are you dressed like that?

                    ZOE
          Halloween. We were supposed to be
          a traffic light but Mona bagged out
          at the last minute and so Bobby and
          I just look like idiots. That's
          typical Mona, by the way.
                                                        82.


Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman
in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          This is my mom.

Stan takes the picture and studies it.

                    STAN
          You look just like her.

                    ZOE
          This is the last picture of her
          that I have. She lived for a few
          more years, but we never took any
          pictures because she didn't want us
          to remember her like that. I was
          eight when she died.

                    STAN
          I...can't imagine.

                    ZOE
          She had a great laugh. And really
          soft hands. She used to rub my
          back before I went to sleep.

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up
next to her clock.

                    STAN
          Do you have any pictures of your
          dad?

Zoe doesn't say anything.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. If you don't want to
          talk about it...

                    ZOE
          My mother was in a coma for two
          years before the end. That's when
          my dad left her.

                      STAN
          Oh.

                    ZOE
          So...that's when he died.    To us,
          anyway.

                      STAN
          God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.
                                                         83.


                    ZOE
              (after a beat)
          It's okay. It was an important
          lesson. That's when I realized
          that nothing lasts forever.

This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          So, that's my story. That's the
          real me.

                    STAN
          Things can last forever, you know.

                    ZOE
          Not for me they can't.

Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while.
Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room.
Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          That's weird.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.

                    STAN
          I'm confused. Why did you say you
          would come witness this birth in
          the first place?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. Seemed like a good
          idea at the time. I was trying to
          get back in their good graces. Go
          home. I'll meet you there. I
          don't want them to see you anyway.

                    STAN
          It's four in the morning. I'm not
          letting you walk home alone.

                    ZOE
          Fine. I'll just pop in, show my
          face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.
                                                          84.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks.
Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.

Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and
rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.

                      CAROL
            Zoe, it's so nice of you to come,
            especially at this crazy hour.

                      LORI
            You're really one of us now.

                      ZOE
            Are you sure you're in labor?
            You're so calm.

                      LORI
            Oh, I'm sure.

                      ZOE
            Well, I just wanted to come and say
            a quick hi and good luck.

                      LORI
            You're not staying?

                      CAROL
            You have to stay. Lori wants us
            all to be together for this.

                      ZOE
            Well, I really want to be here
            but...um, the truth is...actually
            I've been wanting to tell you guys
            for a while but, the truth is...

Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant
MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.

                      CAROL
                (whispering)
            She's having a contraction.

Zoe nods.   This is weird.   Lori breathes through it.

                       LORI
            Okay.   What was it you were saying?

                      ZOE
            I'm back with Stan.
                                                          85.


                      LORI
          Stan who?

                    CAROL
          The farmer?

                    ZOE
          Actually, he makes cheese. He
          named a cheese after me. Isn't
          that romantic? Sort of?
              (off their blank stares)
          Well, anyway, I'm not technically a
          single mother by choice anymore.
          So, if you want me to leave right
          now, I totally understand. I'll
          just walk out the door and--

                    LORI
          No, I really want you to stay.

                      ZOE
                (bummed)
          Oh.

                    CAROL
          Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're
          happy. We'd love to meet him.
          Bring him to group any time.

                    ZOE
          Well, actually, he's downstairs, so
          I should probably get back to--

                     LORI
          Great.   Invite him up.

                    ZOE
          Oh, no, no, no...

                    LORI
          I'm not shy. I've been through
          this before. It's quite beautiful,
          really.

Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse.
After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT BUILDING LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been
reading to pass the time.
                                                       86.


                       STAN
          Excuse me?

                    ZOE
          Just a few minutes.

                    STAN
          I don't know, Zoe.

                    ZOE
          You have to come up. They begged
          me. And truthfully, I'm kind of
          scared of them. Please?


INT. LORI'S APARTMENT - LATER

Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat
brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them
nursing Dakota.

                    STAN
          This is weird.

                    ZOE
          Good brownies, though. This one
          has peanut butter in it.

Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs
rhythmically.

                    CAROL
          Come on everybody, it's time.
          She's getting into the water.

                       STAN
          The what?

                    CAROL
          Oh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe
          tell you?

Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.

                    STAN
          What's a water birth?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. But just so we're
          clear, this...
              (re. the whole scene)
          Is not the real me.
                                                          87.


                    STAN
          I'll wait here.

Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is
an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who
is now naked and pushing.

Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol
is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.

                    CAROL
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

                    ZOE
              (eyes wide)
          Wow. Wow. Wow.

                    CAROL
          I know. It's amazing how the body
          can open up like that.

Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw
up. She stumbles for the door.

                    ZOE
          I'm just going to get some air.
          I'm feeling a little...

                    LORI
          Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal
          point.

Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.

                    MIDWIFE
          Push, Lori. Push.

While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol
chases after, still beating the drum.

                    CAROL
          You can't leave.   You're her focal
          point.

                    ZOE
          Can't she use someone else?
                                                            88.


                    CAROL
          She's in labor. You want to argue
          with her now?

                                               DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single
Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.

                    CAROL
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her
legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.

                     ZOE
          Oh, Jesus.
              (then)
          What is...that?

                    CAROL
          Sssshh. It's perfectly natural.
          Sometimes the bowels just let go.
              (then, back to chanting)
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe
turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.

                    LORI
              (yelling)
          Don't move, Zoe, I need you!
          You're my focal point.

                    ZOE
          What does that even mean?

Zoe turns back.   Her face white as a sheet.   Lori lets out
another WAIL.

                    LORI
          I need to turn over.    Please!

                    JESSIE
          Do it, Lori. We're here for you.
          We're all here for you.

Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The
midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a
loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.
                                                         89.


                    CAROL
              (excited)
          Here comes the head.

Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.

                    JESSIE
          We can see the head, Lori.

                    CAROL
          There's so much hair!

                    ZOE
              (woozy, afraid)
          I don't think that's the baby's
          hair.

                    LORI
          I want to see the head. Get me a
          mirror. It's in the bedroom.

                    ZOE
          I'll get it.

Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room.

                    LORI
          GOD DAMN IT ZOE, DON'T MOVE!!!!


INT. LORI'S FOYER - SAME

Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed.   Next to him is Dakota,
who is crying.

Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the
living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.

                    CAROL (O.S.)
          Stan, get the mirror!


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.

                       STAN
          Excuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan.
          Excuse me.     Hi. I'm Stan.

Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts
her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.
                                                           90.


                    LORI
          Look at all that wet, curly hair.

Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.

                    STAN
              (freaking out)
          Let's get the hell out of here.

                     ZOE
          I can't.   I'm her focal point.

                    STAN
          What does that mean?

                    ZOE
          I don't know.

Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.

Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
plop into the water.

CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
umbilical cord.

CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.

Zoe's eyes roll back and we:

                                              FADE TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No
chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.


INT. LORI'S LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face.    She opens her eyes.   Blinks a
few times.

                    STAN
          Are you okay?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. Why am I wet?

WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool.
Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation
becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What is that?
                                                         91.


                    STAN
              (afraid)
          I think it's the placenta.

Zoe's eyes roll back again and we...

                                             FADE TO BLACK.


EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY

14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to
unload their wares.

Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like
soldiers back from battle.

                   ZOE
          Wow. We really shouldn't have seen
          that.

                    STAN
          No.

                    ZOE
          I did mention that I barely know
          those people, right?

                    STAN
          Like forty times.

                    ZOE
          I feel the need to say it again.

They turn into the Farmer's Market.

ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little
Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.

                    STAN
          It won't be like that for us.

                    ZOE
          How do you know?

                    STAN
          Well, for starters, you wax.

ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.

                    OLIVIA
          Oh, hi.
                                                         92.


                       STAN
          Hi.
              (awkward beat, then)
          You remember Zoe.

                       OLIVIA
          Right, hi.

And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.

                       OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Wow.
                 (then, to Stan)
          Wow.

At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It
says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

                    ZOE
          What is that supposed to mean?

                    OLIVIA
          It's nothing.

Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
              (re. Zoe's pregnant belly)
          I had no idea it was that serious.

                    STAN
          I told you it was serious.

                    ZOE
              (interrupting)
          What the hell does, "sorry about
          last night" mean?

                    OLIVIA
          It's stupid. I was drunk and...

                    STAN
          It was nothing.

                    ZOE
          What was nothing?

Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.

                    OLIVIA
          You're having a baby? I didn't
          know you'd been together that long.
                                                        93.


                    STAN
          Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,
          we're having a baby. Two actually.

On Zoe's look of shock we...

                                                  CUT TO:


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - MOMENTS LATER

The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe
runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.

                    STAN
          Nothing happened.

                    ZOE
          Get away from me.

Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.

                    STAN
          Nothing happened!

                    ZOE
          You said, "they're not mine."

                    STAN
          I didn't mean to say it.

                    ZOE
          How could you say that?

                    STAN
          I don't know. I was flustered.

                       ZOE
          Flustered?

                    STAN
          I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking
          straight. I've been up all night
          watching Orca give birth!

                    ZOE
              (incredulous)
          "They're not mine?"

                     STAN
               (at a loss )
          Well, I mean...technically, they're
          not.
                                                          94.


The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.
Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.

                    ZOE
          You know, all this time you're
          trying to figure out who the real
          me is, but who the fuck are you?

                     STAN
          Zoe.

She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She
runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over
and stands beside her.


INT. LE PAIN QUOTIDIEN - DAY

Zoe and Mona are at their usual table.    Zoe looks like she
hasn't slept.

                    MONA
          Do you really think something
          happened with the berry girl?    They
          both said nothing happened.

                    ZOE
          Well, are they going to come out
          and tell me? And that's not even
          the point. He said, the babies
          weren't his. And if he says that,
          he thinks that. And if he thinks
          that, he's not really committed.

                    MONA
          So, now you run?

                    ZOE
          Why should I stick around for the
          end of the story when I know what
          it's going to be?

Mona says nothing.   She looks like she might say something
and then doesn't.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What? If you want to say
          something, say it.
                                                    95.


                    MONA
          Do you know the end of the story?
          Can't you just give him the benefit
          of the doubt? He seems like such a
          good guy.

                    ZOE
          You haven't even met him.

                    MONA
          Yeah, and don't think I don't know
          the reason for that. You were
          never going to see this through,
          Zoe. Never. It was doomed before
          it began. Just like all of your
          relationships. You get out before
          you get hurt.

                    ZOE
          You don't think I'm hurt right now?

                    MONA
          Every man is not your father. When
          are you going to realize that?

                    ZOE
          You don't know what you're talking
          about.

                    MONA
          I've known you for thirty years. I
          know you don't trust people. You
          and your grandmother, both. She's
          been engaged to Arthur for how long
          now?

                    ZOE
          Leave Nana out of this.

                    MONA
          She's never going to marry him.
          Just like you'd never marry Stan.
          No wonder you ended up with a sperm
          donor. He'll never let you down.
          It's your ideal boyfriend.

Zoe's face changes.    She looks incredibly hurt.

                    ZOE
          I used a donor because I wanted a
          baby.

                       MONA
          I'm sorry.     I went too far.
                                                            96.


                    ZOE
          Because I wanted to have a family.
          Because Nana is the only one I've
          got and she's eighty-four years
          old. And then it will just be me.
          So, yeah, you went a little too
          far.

Zoe leaves Mona at the table.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Zoe and Nuts lie on the pillow together.    Zoe scratches
behind his ears.

                    ZOE
          Guess it's just you and me again.

Nuts licks her face. She gets out of bed and goes to check
her belly in the mirror. It's actually getting kind of huge.


EXT. ZOE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the
sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.

                       ZOE
          What.

                    STAN
          It's Thursday. We have a doctor's
          appointment.

                    ZOE
          There is no "we", Stan.

                    STAN
          Come on, I didn't mean to say it,
          and that's not how I feel.

Zoe shakes her head.

                    ZOE
          I made a mistake trusting you.

                    STAN
          Don't say that.     That's not true.

                    ZOE
          You're not good for me. You made
          me think I needed you, and I don't.
                                                         97.


                    STAN
          So that's it? Because of one
          stupid, asinine thing that I said,
          it's all over? This is how it
          ends?

                     ZOE
          Yes.  This is how it ends.
              (then)
          I don't know why you're so
          surprised. I told you, nothing
          lasts forever.

Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.


INT. DR. HARRIS' OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Harris moves the ultrasound wand over Zoe's belly.   Zoe
holds up her shirt and watches the monitor.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Things look great.

                      ZOE
          Good.

                    DR. HARRIS
          So, I'll see you back in two weeks,
          and we'll start checking to see if
          the babies are dropping.

                    ZOE
          It's hard to believe we're in the
          home stretch.

Dr. Harris helps Zoe sit up.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Now's the time I start discussing a
          birthing plan with my patients. Do
          you want me to wait until next time
          when Stan's here?

                      ZOE
          Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here.

                    DR. HARRIS
          He's out of town or something?

                      ZOE
          No.    He's just...out.
                                                          98.


                     DR. HARRIS
          Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that.

                    ZOE
          It's back to just you and me now.
          We've come full circle.

                    DR. HARRIS
          Well, don't you want anyone with
          you in the delivery room? You
          know, like a birthing partner?


INT. SHADYBROOK COURTYARD - DAY

Zoe and Nana are speed-walking.    Nana stops, excited.

                       NANA
          Me?

                     ZOE
          Yeah.   Is that okay?

                       NANA
          Of course.

                     ZOE
          Good.   `Cause you're all I've got.

                    NANA
          What do I have to do?

                    ZOE
          I don't know. It will be a
          c-section, so, basically, just
          stand there and try not to faint.

                    NANA
          I can do that.

                    ZOE
          Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me
          that you'll be there.

                    NANA
          Are you kidding me? I've been
          waiting my whole life for this.

They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of
leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and
eyes closed.

                    ZOE
          Holy shit, is he dead?
                                                     99.


                       NANA
          Sleeping.

                    ZOE
          How can you tell?

                    NANA
          He's been like that all morning.    I
          wore him out last night.

                     ZOE
          Wow.   I did not need to know that.

                    NANA
          We were celebrating.
              (with a smile)
          We finally set a date.

Zoe stops dead in her tracks.

                       ZOE
          Excuse me?


INT. SHADYBROOK DINING ROOM - DAY

Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.

                    NANA
          So, we'll put the band here and the
          dance floor right here.

                    ZOE
          I can't believe you're getting
          married. What made you change your
          mind?

                    NANA
          All of a sudden it just hit me,
          what am I waiting for? I love him.
          He loves me. What am I so afraid
          of?

                     ZOE
          Wow.   This is...really big news.

                    NANA
          You don't seem happy.

                    ZOE
          No, I am. It's just...it just
          makes my situation seem all the
          more tragic. You're getting
          married and here I am...
                                                        100.


Her voice trails off.

                      NANA
          Zoe.

                    ZOE
          Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really
          happy for you.

                    NANA
          I'm worried about you, honey.

                      ZOE
          I'm fine.

                    NANA
          I just don't want you to make the
          same mistakes I made. I've been
          alone for over thirty years now,
          and that's too long. Sometimes in
          life you have to forgive and move
          on.

                    ZOE
          Are you talking about my father or
          Stan?

                    NANA
          Both, baby.


INT. ZOE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Zoe has her box of photographs.   She pulls out a picture from
the very bottom.

                    NANA (V.O.)
          Because if you don't learn how to
          forgive, you will always be stuck
          in the past.

The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
her, that it can only be her father.

After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to
the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make
up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.

Over this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC.
                                                        101.


INT. CHURCH - DAY

The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana,
lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his
morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have
tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the
sweetest kiss.

ANGLE ON Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a
handkerchief back and forth.


INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER

Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition
of "What a Wonderful World."

Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor.   It's their
first dance as husband and wife.

                    BOBBY
              (singing)
          I see trees of green, red roses
          too. I see them bloom for me and
          you...

Zoe watches, her hands on her belly.   Mona stands beside her.

                    MONA
          This song always makes me cry.

                     ZOE
          Me, too.

                    MONA
          Is it happy or sad? The words are
          happy but the song is so sad.

                    ZOE
          I guess it's both.   Happy and sad.

                    BOBBY
              (singing)
          I see skies of blue and clouds of
          white. The bright blessed day, the
          dark and sacred night...

                    MONA
          I'm sorry about the things I said.

                     ZOE
          I know.
                                                       102.


                    MONA
          It was really shitty of me.

                    ZOE
          It was. Especially because you
          were right.

Mona takes Zoe's hand.

                    BOBBY
              (singing)
          And I think to myself...what a
          wonderful world...

                    ZOE
          I don't want to be alone forever,
          Mona.

                    MONA
          Then don't be.


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - DAY

Stan stares off into space. His beard is back.   A CUSTOMER
surveys the different cheeses on the table.

                    CUSTOMER
          Is this new? The Zoe?

                    STAN
          Yeah. This is the first week it's
          been out.

                    CUSTOMER
          Can I have a sample?     What's it
          like?

                    STAN
          It's...very stubborn, overly
          suspicious and distrustful of men.

The customer looks up at Stan.

                    CUSTOMER
          Huh?


INT. SHADYBROOK REC ROOM - LATER

Bobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor.

                    BOBBY
          Come on, you old maid.
                                                       103.


                       ZOE
          No.

                    BOBBY
          Dance with me. One dance.

                       ZOE
          Forget it.

                    BOBBY
          Fine. But it doesn't mean that I
          won't dance with you.

                       ZOE
          What?

Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake
style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk
away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path
and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his
ass triple-time, like Beyonce.

                       BOBBY
          Haaaaaay.

                    ZOE
          Go away, you freak.

A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping,
thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.

                    BOBBY
          Smack it, Bitch.

Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          You know you love it. Uh-huh.
          That's right. Smack it.

The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new
dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples
smacking each other's asses.

While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face.

Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he
lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he
hits the floor.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          What the hell?

An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.
                                                         104.


                    OLD MAN
          Damn it. Not again.
              (then, checks pants)
          Nope. Not me.

A few other old people look down and check themselves.   At
which point, Zoe looks down and realizes.

                    ZOE
          I think my water just broke.


EXT. SHADYBROOK RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as
Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the
logistics of the trip to the hospital.

                    ZOE
          I'll drive.

                    NANA
          You're in labor.   You can't drive.

                    ARTHUR
          I'll drive.

                     NANA
          You don't have a car or a license.
              (then, to Bobby)
          You drive.

                    BOBBY
          We're in Queens. I don't even know
          what side of the road they drive on
          here.

                    ZOE
          Will someone please just drive me
          to the fucking hospital?

All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.   Mona's at the
wheel. She leans out and waves.

                    MONA
          This was my surprise for after the
          wedding, but let's hit it.

                    BOBBY
          This works.

They all pile in.
                                                       105.


And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST
MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along
behind them.


INT. ROLLS ROYCE - LATER

Things are a bit frantic in the car.

                    NANA
          Are you okay? Remember to breathe.
          Breathe in, breathe out, breathe
          in.

Mona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths.

                    MONA
          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.

                    NANA
              (joining in)
          Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...

                     MONA/NANA
          Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee...

                    ZOE
          Please stop. It's getting really
          breathy in here. I'm fine.

                    BOBBY
          What about me? I have amniotic
          fluid on my Gucci tux.

ANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked.

                    ARTHUR
          Who needs a drink?

Everyone (including Zoe) raises their hands.


INT. LENOX HILL HOSPITAL - DAY

Zoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in
tow. Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand. Nana
grabs the glass and swigs it.

                    NANA
              (whispering)
          Bobby...

                     BOBBY
          What?
                                                         106.


                    NANA
          I don't know if I can do this.

                       BOBBY
          What?!

                    NANA
          I can't go in with her.

                    BOBBY
          Well, I certainly can't do it.   I
          don't do vaginas.

They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his
walker.

                    ARTHUR
          Don't look at me.

Nana starts to hyperventilate.

                    NANA
          Help me, Bobby.

                    BOBBY
          Nana, pull yourself together. This
          is the biggest moment of Zoe's
          life, and you can't let her down.
          I'd slap you right now, but I'm
          afraid your teeth would fly out.


INT. LABOR AND DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

Zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown.

                    ZOE
          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.

 Bobby enters, all sweetness and light.

                       BOBBY
          Hey, girl.     How ya doing?

                       ZOE
          Okay.

                    BOBBY
          Good.
              (smiles, then)
          So, I really don't want you to
          worry, but Nana just passed out at
          the nurse's station and is now down
          in the ER getting stitches.
                                                        107.


                       ZOE
          What???

                    BOBBY
          Everything's under control. Good
          thing we're at the hospital, right?

Zoe jumps out of bed.

                    ZOE
          Where is she?

                    BOBBY
          Get back in bed. All is well.
          Arthur's with her. Now, on to
          bigger and better...who do you want
          to be your birthing partner? Your
          choices are me or Mona.

Zoe starts to cry.

                    BOBBY (CONT'D)
          I know. They're shitty choices.
          Do you want me to call your scary
          lesbian friends from your group?

                    ZOE
          I don't know.

                    BOBBY
          We're going to get through this,
          okay? You just have to really
          think about it. Who do you want
          with you in the delivery room?

Zoe wipes her tears.

                     BOBBY (CONT'D)
          Who is the one person you want by
          your side?


EXT. 77TH STREET - DAY

Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital
gown.

                       ZOE
          Taxi!


INT. TAXI - MOMENTS LATER

Zoe jumps in.   The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror
                                                       108.


                    CABBIE
          You're not an escaped mental
          patient, are you?

                       ZOE
          Kind of.


EXT. 14TH STREET - DAY

Zoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her
like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero.

And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
herself.

                     ZOE
          Ow.   Son of a bitch, that hurts.

                    OLIVIA
          Are you okay?

Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry
on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees
Olivia.

                    OLIVIA (CONT'D)
          Are you in labor?

As soon as the contraction ends...

                       ZOE
          Fuck off.

Zoe takes off again.    Olivia watches her go.


EXT. FARMER'S MARKET - LATER

Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan.

ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading
cheese.

                       ZOE
          Stan!

Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs
bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.

                    FRED
          Whoa. I've had nightmares that
          started like this.
                                                      109.


                      ZOE
          Stan!

Stan turns.

                      STAN
          Zoe?

                      ZOE
          Stan!

                    STAN
          Are you okay? Don't run!

                    ZOE
          I can't help it!

She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her.
They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.

                    STAN
          Are you all right?

                    ZOE
              (panting)
          Great. I'm great.

                    STAN
          Why are you in a hospital gown?

                    ZOE
          I'm in labor.

                     STAN
          What?   What the hell are you doing
          here?

                      ZOE
          It's you.

                      STAN
          What?

                      ZOE
          Nana's my birthing partner, but she
          passed out and needed stitches, and
          Bobby asked me who I most wanted
          with me, and...it's you. It's only
          you.
               (then)
          I don't want to be alone anymore.
          I love you. You don't know how
          much I love you.
                                                          110.


Stan doesn't know what to say.   He's literally speechless.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          More than anything in the world, I
          love you.

                    STAN
          I've been in love with you since
          the moment you stole my cab.

Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction.

                    ZOE
          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
          hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan
laughs and throws his arms around her.

                      ZOE (CONT'D)
          Ow.   Ow.   Ow.

                     STAN
          I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
          love you. I love you so much.
              (then)
          Let's get the hell out of here.

                    ZOE
          Yeah. I think I really need to go
          to the hospital now.

They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other.
Stan has tears in his eyes.

                    STAN
          Let's go have our babies.

People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's
Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
but applaud the big moment.


INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY

Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing...

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling.    She does not
look scared. And she does not look alone.

WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side.
                                                        111.


And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr.
Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one
by one.

We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed
back to Zoe and Stan.

Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other.
They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.


INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

It's night.   Zoe is asleep.

She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she
is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to
her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed.

To the side of the bed are two bassinets.   Each baby sleeping
soundly in a little pink hat.

And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her
forehead.


EXT. 6TH AVENUE - DAY

Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that
says, "I'M A BIG BROTHER."

We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each
with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both
girls have flaming red hair.

A woman pushing a stroller passes by.   She smiles at Zoe and
Stan. They smile back.

                     WOMAN
          Hi.

                     ZOE
          Hi.

                     STAN
          Hi.


INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - DAY

They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.

                    ZOE
          Who knew you were such a romantic.
                                                112.


                     STAN
          Well, it's the anniversary of our
          first date. Where else would I
          take you?
              (then)
          Cheers.

They clink dogs and each take a bite.

                    STAN (CONT'D)
          What a year, huh?

                    ZOE
          Incredible. Wouldn't change a
          thing. Well, except for the part
          where you dumped me.

                    STAN
          And the part where you dumped me.
              (to the babies)
          Girls...Mommy and Daddy were
          stupid.

The babies smile and coo.

                    ZOE
              (baby-talk)
          Yes, we were. Yes, we were.

                    STAN
          The first time we held hands was in
          here. It started out as a high-
          five, but then I strategically
          turned into a hand-hold.

                    ZOE
          How do you remember that?

                    STAN
          We both agreed that we were totally
          sick of weddings and hated when
          people wrote their own vows.

                    ZOE
          That's right. I remember that.

                    STAN
          So...I hope you won't hold it
          against me.

                    ZOE
          What?
                                                         113.


Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at
them, confused.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What are you doing here?

And then Bobby comes through the door.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          Bobby?

And then Mona.

                    ZOE (CONT'D)
          What's happening?

And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori
and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.
And we...

                                                DISSOLVE TO:


INT. GRAY'S PAPAYA HOT DOGS - LATER

Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to
face in front of the guests and the priest.

                    STAN
          I promise to love you even though
          you still eat chicken McNuggets in
          bed. I promise to name cheeses
          after all of our children no matter
          how embarrassed they are by it. I
          promise to always check out your
          ass when you walk away, and I
          promise to love you more tomorrow
          than I do today, which doesn't even
          seem impossible...

And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound
of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in...

And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some
things that really will last forever.

                                           FADE TO BLACK.

    FADE IN:

1   EXT. MIAMI LANDSCAPE - NIGHT                                   1
    The sun might be down, but the city is baking. Waves of
    heat ascend into the sky while an unmarked van navigates
    ACROSS the SCREEN.

2   INT. UNMARKED VAN - IN MOTION - NIGHT                          2
    The driver is EDDIE DOMINGUEZ. And riding in the passen-
    ger seat is a man dressed in black, called FOUCHET. He
    looks to the rear.
                             FOUCHET
               What's taking so long back there?
                                                  CUT TO:

    REAR
    Where the rest of the gang waits.      NOAH, KUNI, FERGUSON,
    and CASPER. All dressed in black      like Fouchet, except
    for ANDY. He stands and shows off      his Miami PD uniform.
    His English is poor, yet he's got     a big, happy-to-be-
    along grin on his face.
                             ANDY
               How do I look? Like the real
               thing, yeah?
                             FOUCHET
               Step back and lemme get a good
               look at you.


    CLOSE SHOT - REAR VIEW MIRROR
    THROUGH which Eddie can watch the action. Andy steps
    further to the rear, almost to the door, facing the
    front.
                             FOUCHET
               Tell me again about your
               assignment, Andrew?
                             ANDY
               I'm the decoy.
                             FOUCHET
               Right you are.
    Over the seat Fouchet reveals a SHOTGUN.     BOOM!

                                                              2.
3    EXT. VAN IN MOTION                                            3
     Andy's body is blown through the rear doors as the van
     turns a corner.

4    INT. VAN - FOUCHET                                            4
     He dials 911 on his cellular phone.     Fouchet sounds
     distressed.
                            FOUCHET
              Please help! I just saw a
              policeman shot! Send help.
              Hurry! I'm at the corner of...


5    EXT. NEAR DOWNTOWN - VAN - NIGHT                              5
     A stream of PD CARS haul past, lights blazing and SIRENS
     on full.

6    EXT. COLONY HOTEL (SOUTH BEACH) - NIGHT                       6
     Crowds moving up and down Ocean Blvd. Beautiful people
     walking. Beautiful people watching. MUSIC BLENDS from
     nightclub to nightclub. A POLICE RADIO, holstered to the
     hip of a street cop. It CRACKLES with:
                            POLICE RADIO (V.O.)
              Report of an officer down. Be
              advised, all units. Corner of
              Lennox and Taylor.
     Slipping by the street cop: Intro MARCUS BURNETT and
     MIKE LOWREY. They shimmy through the hotel doors.


A7   INT. COLONY HOTEL - NIGHT                                     A7
     Where the buffed DESK MANAGER gets off the phone to
     greet the effeminate pair.
                              LOWREY
              Good evening.    I'm Mike --
                            BURNETT
              -- And I'm Marcus.
                            LOWREY
              We're lookin' for a couple of our
              Latin friends who checked in a
              little while ago. You might
              remember them?
                                                  (CONTINUED)

              No chest hair. And packin'.
                             DESK MANAGER
              I'm sorry.   But our guest list is
              private.
                            LOWREY
              Oh, didn't they say? There's
              going to be party! It's
              B.Y.O.B.O. --
                     (leans in close)
              The B.O. stands for baby oil.
                            BURNETT
              Maybe you can come. Get off after
              you get off?
     All three of them laugh.
                            DESK MANAGER
              Well, now that you mention it.
              They were kinda cute. Suite 202.

7    INT. COLONY HOTEL - STAIRWELL - NIGHT                       7
     Lowrey and Burnett clip on their shields and unholster
     their guns. The posing is over. This is business.

A8   INT. COLONY HOTEL - SUITE 202 - NIGHT                       A8
     On the table are two briefcases. Each opened. One
     containing cocaine. The other, cash. A pistol next
     to each.

     REVEAL the dealers. Two young Dominicans seated across
     from the TV, getting high, drinking beer and laughing out
     loud at the Spanish language version of Time Traxx.
     Then --
     BANG! The door's kicked in and Lowrey's first through.
     Burnett on backup.
                             LOWREY
              Police!   On the floor!
     But the dealers split, rolling out of their chairs.   One
     goes left and the other, right.
                                               CUT TO:

                                                           4.
B8   BEDROOM                                                      B8
     Lowrey tackles the first dealer to the floor. A LATINA
     girl screams. Lowrey unfortunately looks and takes a
     hard fist across the ear from the dealer. Angered,
     Lowrey swings his pistol up underneath the perp's jaw

     him to the sink. Meanwhile... Back to:

     Burnett's in trouble. He's still got his gun in hand.
     But the other dealer has him pinned underneath the legs
     of a chair.
                              BURNETT
                Lowrey!
     Burnett stomps the bad guy's instep. The guy buckles.
     Burnett rolls away and stands in front of a window, just
     in time to see the angry Dominican heading straight for
     him.

A9   EXT. COLONY HOTEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION                        A9
     Burnett   and the other dealer come crashing out onto the
     balcony,   then over onto an awning, rolling off onto some
     occupied   cafe tables. Patrons scatter. Uniformed cops
     move in   to assist.

     appears soon after, walking down the hotel steps, leading
     the Latina in his cuffs, and wearing his jacket.

     As the helicopter passes over, he appears  from behind a

     him, all wearing high-tech miner's helmets  with built-in
     radio headsets, and an array of high-tech  tools.

     The team crosses the roof to a huge air conditioning
     unit. They climb inside, carrying a six-foot-long metal
     case and what looks like a black scuba tank.

     Though it's windy and cramped in here, at least it's
     cool. From a prone position, Fouchet puts on his night
     vision goggles and reveals a palm top computer. Quickly
     he scrolls through the labyrinthine schematics loaded
     onto the unit. TILT DOWN to see the various ducts.
     Endless. Bottomless. But clearly, Fouchet's a man who

     OFFICER BILL O'FEE, 50s, reads a magazine and drinks

     different lockers inside the evidence room. We see one
     room with stacks upon stacks of heroin.

     Kuni finds the conduit he's looking for, splices it,
     cuts into it with a Makita battery-powered circular saw,
     then attaches a handheld high-8 video machine and starts
     the video feed. The unit is strapped to the conduit.

     BANG! Another air conditioning vent grate crashes to
     the floor. Their headlights blazing, two men clamber
     into the cavernous room, Fouchet along with Casper. This
     is the special Drug Holding Room: The lock cuts like
     butter and the steel door is yanked open. One hundred
     million dollars in heroin. Each kilo brick is stamped
     with a distinctive octopus logo.

     Sure enough.    As O'Fee stands from his desk --

     Where Ferguson is waiting with an air-powered tranquil-
     izer gun. He cuts loose a silent round that strikes
     O'Fee at the base of the neck. O'Fee stops. But before
     he can think to reach back at what hit him, his knees
     buckle and he drops to the linoleum. Out cold.

     One by one he moves backwards through the various levels

     Noah removes what looks like a flattened bobsled with
     large urethane wheels from the metal case and places it
     inside the air shaft.
     Ferguson attaches the black "scuba tank," labeled
     "NITROUS OXIDE," to a valve. This is connected to a
     metal-cased cable system that is piston-gunned into the
     floor.

     Fouchet and Casper moving the stacks of heroin, placing
     them in the air duct on the bobsled. Once they're done,
     we hear RADIO GARBLE, then the sled is cabled to the con-
     traption. A button is pushed -- and the sled is pulled
     at breakneck speed through the duct.

     Where Lowrey wakes up in a king-sized bed. The pain on
     his face and empty, scattered bottles tell us he's
     nursing a world-class hangover. He sits up, carefully,
     holds his aching head. Hearing BREATHING, Lowrey lifts
     the sheet next to him.

     REVEAL THE LATINA
     The one from the Colony Hotel. He drops the sheet back
     over her head, reaches over to his nightstand and grabs
     an industrial-sized bottle of Excedrin. Empty. He opens
     the nightstand drawer, extracts another bottle. Empty.

     All marble and brass. Lowrey opens up his medicine
     cabinet. Locating a new bottle of aspirin... he suddenly
     realizes that the SHOWER is RUNNING. Confused, he pulls
     open the shower curtain slightly. From the back, it's an
     incredible body, then she turns around and it's --
     THE LATINA
     Yes.   The very same as the one he just saw in bed.    What?
                               LATINA TWIN
               'Morning.
     Lowrey closes the curtain on her. Frowns at this
     impossibility. He steps back into the doorway and peers
     over at his bed. Yep, same face. Twins?

                      (shaking his head)

     Burnett and his young wife, THERESA, are jarred awake by
     the CLOCK RADIO BLARING on the night stand. Theresa
     gropes for RADIO, shuts it OFF. Burnett playfully gropes
     for her.
                             THERESA
               Marcus, what are you doing?

               We're always saying we should
               spend more quality time together.
               Well, I got the time... and you
               got the quality...
     She laughs.   He kisses her.
                             BURNETT
               I can remember when we used to
               do it every morning.

               That was how we got a three
               bedroom house filled with little
               Burnetts.

     Pandemonium. There's the two-and-a-half-year-old,
     MEGAN, who's taking bites of food and spitting it back
     out, looking at it, then putting it back in. Six-year-
     old JILL, who is playing refrigerator magnet games on the
     fridge. And Marcus in the middle of it all, deftly side-
     stepping his eight-year-old boy, QUINCY, who appears on
     roller blades whizzing through with a hockey stick and
     ball. He body-checks Jill against the ice box.
                            JILL
              Mom, Quincy pushed me.
                            QUINCY
              Uncle Mike showed me that move.

                            THERESA
              Quincy, never-you-mind. And take
              those things off in the house!
              Jill, stop with the book and eat
              your breakfast.
                     (then, exasperated)
              Marcus, why do I always have to
              discipline the kids? You play
              bad cop for a second.
     Alongside the kitchen screen door we see Lowrey's PORSCHE
     ROAR to a stop in the driveway.
                            BURNETT
              Kids, knock it off... or your
              momma's gonna whoop your butts!
     Theresa laughs in spite of herself as the kids continue
     to fight. Into this craziness enters Mike Lowrey...
                            LOWREY
              Ah, family life. Reminds me
              why I stay single.

              Hiya, kids.   Mornin', Theresa.
     Lowrey pecks Theresa on the cheek.   She recoils.

              Don't kiss me, Lowrey. I don't

               Oh, baby.   Damn.
      Lowrey shakes his head.

               talk about special effects.
                             BURNETT
               What special effects?

40   INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY                                  40
     Burnett and Lowrey know there's big problems when, at the
     bottom of the stairwell, the first thing they see is a
     yellow police tape and fingerprint team dusting a torched
     lock. Problem is, the building is nothing but cops and
     it looks as if the entire department is stomping all over
     the evidence room.

                            RUIZ
              Could it be... Dopey?
     Both laugh hysterically, while:

              If it ain't the leftovers from
              Miami Vice. Fashion casualties,
              lost somewhere in the eighties.
                            BURNETT
              And the women really go for that.
              Really, they do.
     As Burnett and Lowrey duck the tape, they note a very
     groggy O'Fee over in the corner being attended by a
     paramedic team. He's still out cold. An oh shit look
     passes between the two partners.

41   INT. HEROIN LOCKER - DAY                                   41
     Another torched lock noted as Burnett and Lowrey enter
     with Sanchez an Ruiz behind them. The room is emptied.
     Captain HOWARD appears. He's short, has a military
     haircut, and has a minor Napoleon complex and a major in
     paranoia.
                            HOWARD
              Nice of you to roll in. And
              nothing particular is going on
              around here except, maybe, your
              dope is gone. That's right. The
              biggest dope bust in the history
              of this department up and walked
              out of this locker, along with
              maybe my job and the two of yours
              if we don't get the shit back.
                            BURNETT
              This can't be happening.

              So here's what we're gonna do.
              Since it was originally your
              case, you two guys are on point.
              Sanchez and Ruiz, you back them
              up with whatever they need.
     Groans all around.
                            LOWREY
              So I guess we should start with
              the C.I.s and the perps from the
              original case. But hell if I
              know any dope dealers with the
              balls to pull this off. They're
              either dead or in the lock-up
              pending trial.
                               BURNETT
              How's O'Fee?
                            SINCLAIR (O.S.)
              Oh, he'll be just fine.
     From the side appears a cigar-chewing Internal Affairs
     suit named SINCLAIR. He circles close to Burnett and
     Lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks.
                            HOWARD
              Name's Sinclair. Internal
              Affairs. He's our new proctologist.
                            SINCLAIR
              You see, what's got me confused
              is, why risk leaving a witness?
              Why not kill O'Fee instead?

                            BURNETT
              Because maybe this guy knows if
              you kill a cop the whole
              department'll get up his ass
              hard and fast.
                            SINCLAIR
              And who knows that better than
              anybody else? Cops.
                            BURNETT
              You're not sayin' this was an
              inside job. Cops wouldn't pull
              this shit.

              Enough. I.A.'s in it and there's
              nothing we can do about it. If
              any of this leaks, the shit's
              gonna hit our biggest fan.
              Remember him? The mayor? He
              created us and you can bet your
              jobs, boys, he'll rip us into
              little cop pieces. I figure we
              got seventy-two hours to find the
              dope and keep our jobs.

              incentive.

     He walks to the center of the room and kneels to those
     four bolt holes in the floor. He fingers the paraffin
     filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.

                            BURNETT
              What about the air conditioning?
                            HOWARD

     stalling the oscillating fan with his cuffs and crawling
     through. The first thing Burnett notices are the track
     marks from the bobsled cutting through a coating of dust.
                             LOWREY
              Anything?

              Yeah. I got some weird track
              marks in here.
     Then Burnett notes a manufacturing stamp at the joint.
     It reads: ORONA AIR CONTITIONING SYSTEMS, INC.

              Who's Max's friend?
                             BURNETT
              A cop.
                              BLACK WOMAN
              Oooh.    I love cops.
     The other girls are suddenly interested, too.   Burnett
     swallows and...
                            BURNETT
              You know? I'm a cop. I shot
              somebody just last week. Didn't
              kill him, just shot him in the
              ass.
     Stone cold looks from them all. They walk away with
     Burnett giving a "what did I say" look. Lowrey appears.
                            LOWREY
              You know, that was really smooth.
              Think you could do that again?
                     (as they start
                      walking)
              Ohh. I'll tell you, when the wife
              gets meaner, the grass gets greener.
                            BURNETT
              Green ain't the color I was
              thinkin' of. More of a coco puff.
              Just real shiny, thick...

     As they head toward their car, Burnett's BEEPER SOUNDS.
     He switches it OFF.
                            BURNETT
              Damn! The woman's got fuckin'
              radar on my ass. Sensed me
              lookin' at another woman. Bet
              she wants me to pick up Huggies
              'stead of those baby Garanimals
              that they wear.
                            LOWREY
              I don't think anybody could be
              that married.

50   INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR - IN MOTION - DAY                 50
     Burnett drives cautiously while both he and Lowrey bob
     to Ice-T's "COP KILLER." They get a kick out of the
     song.
                            LOWREY
                     (complies)
              Miami's the perfect town for you,
              Burnett. You drive like a one-
              hundred-seven-year-old lady with
              her turn signal on.
                            BURNETT
              And I plan on living to be old
              just like 'em. Rubbin' Ben Gay
              on my joints and everythin'.

     An old guy passes them even though his car is pulling
     an Airstream camper behind it. Lowrey can't believe it.
                            LOWREY
              You gonna let every old
              motherfucker pass you? Or just
              the ones with big-ass trailers
              draggin' behind? A-c-c-el-er-ate.
                            BURNETT
              I don't have a death wish like
              you. I  got a family that counts
              on me.  A mortgage to pay. And
              I'm not sayin' it's me, but most
              of the guys in the station think
              you're some rich kid playin' cop.
                            LOWREY
              Who said that?

     Burnett mumbles an answer.
                            LOWREY
              If somebody's talking about me, I
              wanna know... Man, I'm so sick of
              this. I don't apologize for
              nothing I do. I get up early and
              take it to the max every day. I'm
              always the first guy through the
              door. And the last guy to leave a
              crime scene. So fuck 'em all. I
              could give a shit what those boot
              lickin', brown-nosin', ass kissin'
              motherfuckers think of Mike Lowrey.
     What can Burnett say to all that, but...

              I love you, man.
     He lets loose a big grin.
                            LOWREY
              Oh, fuck you, Marcus.
     The RADIO CRACKLES.
                            DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                     (over radio)
              Two-one? I got that address for
              you on the air conditioning
              company. Oh, and Theresa called,
              she added something to your grocer
              list: Muppets toothpaste. Bubble
              gum flavor. She says Quincy
              doesn't like mint.
     Lowrey rolls his eyes, glances at Burnett, who's
     embarrassed.
                           LOWREY
              Yeah. Roger that. Gimme the
              address.
                            DISPATCHER (V.O.)
              Orona's been working out of his
              house. He's at...

51   EXT. KEY BISCAYNE ESTATE - ESTABLISHING - DAY             51
     Burnett and Lowrey step from their unmarked car and
     start up the steps to this stony, estate-sized house.

                            LOWREY
              The air conditioning business
              has been good to Orona.
     Lowrey rings the bell.   They wait.   No answer.
                            BURNETT
              Well, we can leave a note or we
              can break and enter --
                            LOWREY
              Wait. Hear that? I thought I
              heard Orona beating his wife.

52   INT. ESTATE - REAR DOOR                                       52
     Lowrey kicks the door in.
                              LOWREY
              Uh oh.    No alarm.
                              BURNETT
              Aw, man.    Did you cut one?
                              LOWREY
              No, man.    Musta been you.
                               BURNETT
              Not me.
     Lowrey and Burnett look at each other and draw guns.

                               LOWREY AND BURNETT
              Dead guy.

53   INT. ORONA'S DEN - DAY                                        53
     The door is unlocked and swings open easily to reveal
     Lowrey and Burnett in an instant, repulsed reaction to
     Orona's body which sits upright in his office chair, the
     body grotesque and bloated.
                               LOWREY
              Now what?
     A sickened Burnett goes over to the body, speaking to
     Orona as if he were alive.
                            BURNETT
              Where are the drugs?
                     (no answer)
              Where... are... the... drugs?
                     (shrugs)
              He ain't sayin' nothin'. He must
              be guilty of somethin'.
     Meanwhile, Lowrey's got   no problem with the dead body.
     He tries opening a desk   drawer, but Orona's rigor mortis-
     stiffened knee is in the   way. So Lowrey gives it a shove
     and the chair swivels.    Orona's dead arm sweeps the lamp
     off the desk.
                            BURNETT
              Whoa. Watch where you're swinging
              them dead arms, Orona. You're
              gonna fuck up your own crime
              scene.

     Lowrey braves the body and gingerly pokes around his
     pockets.
                              BURNETT
                Watch what you touch.   That's
                evidence.
                              BURNETT
                Not touching. Browsing... Mr. Orona.
                You've got the right to remain
                silent. Anything you say'll
                surprise the shit out of us.
                             BURNETT
                Anything?

                              LOWREY
                       (finds small notepad)
                Jai-Alai. Dog track. Lotta
                bookies. Phone numbers.

                conditioning contract for the P.D.
                He'd have the plans.
                              LOWREY
                He trades the plans for his paper
                and gets popped by the perps.
                              BURNETT
                Works for me. Now can we go?
                I'm gonna puke.

      one of those big, model's shoulder bags to the floor and

              It's a favor for a friend. If it

              Yeah, right.     You're in love.
                            MAX
              It's never gonna happen. I'm
              great at turning lovers into
              friends. But turning friends
              into lovers, I can't do.

              Well, I don't date cops. They
              never have enough money and
              they're always too tired to
              screw.
                            MAX
              Well, I've told you before, my
              Mike isn't like that. If I were
              in real trouble, Mike Lowrey is
              the only person I'd call.

     Upon arrival, the door is opened to Max and Julie by
     Eddie Dominguez, instantly recognizeable from the heist.
     Eddie's pouring champagne into a glass.
                             EDDIE
               Max, my little carina. It's
               been a long time. And who's
               your friend?
                              MAX
               Eddie.   Julie.

     Julie sizes him up.    Good taste.   His suit.   Bad taste.
     His personality.
                             EDDIE
               Come on, Julie. Come in, Max.
               Welcome to the Al Capone suite.
     Thev're stepped into a grand, opulent suite. High
     arched ceilings. Magnificent antique furniture. Killer
     view. No party guests.
                             EDDIE
               I'm not kidding. Capone had
               the place fixed up with secret
               passages and hidden stairways.
               Can you dig it? People were
               actually killed within these
               walls.
     He's moved behind them and reveals a concealed staircase
     that rises into darkness.


     CLOSE ON JULIE
     Not happy. Stuck at the Biltmore with a Scarface
     wannabe. She looks over at Max. Let's get outta here.
                              JULIE
               Excuse me?   I need to use the
               bathroom.
     Julie crosses to the bathroom.
                             EDDIE
               Wow, Maxi. I thought you dropped
               off the edge of the earth and died.
               Either that or you moved to
               California.

              So, Eddie. Looks like we're
              way too early. How's about we
              come back later?

              No. Don't go yet. We can
              party. Just us three. Look at
              what Eddie's got to play with.
     From underneath the couch Eddie reveals a single key of
     heroin. Max tries to hide the recognition that she just
     hit paydirt on the very first try.

60   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                      60
     Where she's silently cursing Max for getting her into
     this lame-ass party when she hears MUFFLED VOICES outside
     the bathroom. Instinctively, Julie peers through the
     louvered shades.

61   JULIE'S POV - THROUGH SHADES                               61
     She sees Eddie opening the door to Fouchet.   Casper and
     Noah follow him inside.

     Eddie is instantly nervous in the presence of Fouchet.
                            FOUCHET
              Who's the girl, Eddie?
                            EDDIE
              Just a hooker --

                            MAX
              My name's Max.
                     (outstretched hand)
              I'm just a friend.
                            FOUCHET
              I could use a friend who looks
              like you. Turn around. Lemme
              get a good look.
     Max tries to size this man, then chooses to submit. She
     does her best model's turn. Slowly giving him a view of
     the rear when --
     Fouchet draws a PISTOL -- BAM BAM!!
     Max tumbles forward and CRASHES through a GLASS TABLE.

                                                            27.
63   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                         63
     Instant horror. Julie saw Max killed and retreats to
     the opposite side of the bathroom in total fright.

     Now, Fouchet swings the gun onto Eddie.
                             FOUCHET
               You're a fucking idiot. Hookers
               talk. Now, is that my dope?
                             EDDIE
                      (freaked)
               Our dope... That was the deal,
               yeah? Right. Until we got the
               money --
     BAM!   Fouchet SHOOTS Eddie in the knee.   Eddie screams!
                             EDDIE
               You fucker... fucker fucker
               fucker!!!
                             FOUCHET
               I have four more days until I
               make the deal. When it's done
               you get your money. Now, what
               part don't you understand?
                              EDDIE
               Hey, man.   You need me.
                             FOUCHET
               I don't need anybody. I got three
               little angels looking over my
               shoulder.

     REVERSE SHOT - EDDIE'S CHAIR
     Fouchet UNLOADS THREE MORE SHOTS.    BAM BAM BAM!!!   Blood
     spatters onto Casper.
                            CASPER
               Aw, man. You got blood on my
               new suit.
                             FOUCHET
               Ever hear of dry cleaning? Now,
               shut the fuck up, check for the
               rest of my dope.

65   INT. BATHROOM - JULIE                                      65
     Half-panicked, half-trying to keep her head. There's no
     way out of the bathroom. All she can do is switch off
     the light. And now she sees Casper's shadow as he
     approaches.

     CLOSE ON DOORKNOB
     As it turns. Julie suddenly reaches for it and pulls
     open the door with a surge. Casper stumbles in, his
     face hitting the hard tile with a crunch.

66   INT. CAPONE SUITE - JULIE                                  66

     Making her move, she hauls as fast as she can across the
     room. Aiming for that secret fireplace door.

     FOUCHET
     Wheels with his PISTOL, unloads the clip. BULLETS are
     catching up, ripping up the couch and the rest of the
     suite. Julie dives right into the secret door.

67   INT. SECRET PASSAGEWAY - SAME TIME                         67
     Dark. Twisting. We MOVE WITH Julie as she races through
     it, heart in her throat. She comes upon some old metal
     stairs, a sliver of light at the top, and clambers up...

68   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    68
     High atop the Biltmore, this is where the passageway
     leads out to. A door flies open and Julie appears.
     Panicked. Wind whipping all around her. A bird flies
     by, startling her. Hearing the APPROACHING THUGS, Julie
     sprints as best she can across the Spanish-tiled roof.
     Turns to see --

69   EXT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT                                    69
     Noah and Casper appear in the Bell Tower. Noah scans
     the roof, takes aim and FIRES, but he's too far away --
     and Julie disappears behind a rise in the roof.

70   EXT. BILTMORE - ROOFTOP - JULIE - NIGHT                    70
     She steps towards the edge of the roof. Quickly peers
     over. A huge swimming pool, five stories down.

     She weighs the options.   Jump or die.

     NOAH AND CASPER
     As they try running across the harsh-tiled roof...
                            CASPER
              Now look. My fuckin' shoes.      My
              fuckin' Italian shoes!
     Then Julie prays silently, takes a running start and
     leaps from the roof. SLOW-MOTION as Julie flies through
     the air like some glamorous angel.


71   EXT. BILTMORE POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT                    71
     as Julie breaks the surface with a huge splash. The
     water swirls as her aching body struggles to the surface.

72   EXT. BILTMORE POOL - SURFACE - NIGHT                       72
     Julie breaks water like a dolphin, gasping for breath.
     She's dazed and confused, but alive -- for the moment.

73   INT. AL CAPONE SUITE - NIGHT                               73
     Fouchet reaches down and picks up Max's purse, then
     flicks it across the room to the defeated pair of Casper
     and Noah.
                            FOUCHET
              She's a hooker. Find out who
              she works for. Find out where
              she lives.

74   EXT. BILTMORE HOTEL - HALF-HOUR LATER                      74
     Several police cars, an ambulance and a coroner's van
     are now parked in front, the lobby awash in strobing
     red and blue lights. CAMERA PANS PAST the crime scene
     personnel to find Burnett and Lowrey pulling up to the
     scene. They get out and thread their way through the
     growing chaos.

75   INT. BILTMORE - AL CAPONE SUITE - NIGHT                    75
     The place is a mess. Homicide detectives are already on
     the scene, drawing chalk circles around casings on the
     floor.

     On the far side of the commotion, the two bodies have
     been photographed and are covered. Chief Howard is
     conferring with a technician who's dusting for prints.

     BURNETT AND LOWREY
     enter.
     But Sanchez and Ruiz are already on the scene.
                             RUIZ
               You guys watch where you're walking
               or you'll fuck up the crime scene.

                             BURNETT
               Looks like you're already doing
               that.
     Burnett's quick to point out the trail of bloody foot-
     prints Ruiz just tracked across the carpet.

     CLOSE ON CHAMPAGNE GLASS
     Which Julie left on the fireplace mantel. Lowrey's quick
     to note the two separate shades of lipstick.
                             HOWARD
               Two dead. A hood registered as
               Eddie Dominguez and some Jane
               Doe. But the table over there's
               covered in high-grade dope. Sound
               familiar?
                                LOWREY
               I think we    got us a witness.
               Over here    I got two different
               shades of    lipstick on one
               champagne    glass.
     Meanwhile --

     BURNETT
     He drops the sheet on Eddie's body, then moves over to
     Max's. He doesn't know it's her until --
                               BURNETT
               Jesus, no...
                               LOWREY

     Burnett drops the sheet, turns and puts a protective
     shoulder between Lowrey and the body.
                               LOWREY
              What?     Who is it?
     Lowrey instintively pushes past his partner and kneels
     at the body. He pulls back the sheet. Right now he
     could kill the shooter, then himself. In that order.
     Lowrey's eyes well up.
                            LOWREY
              I shoulda told you to be careful.


76   INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT                          76
     The elevator doors open and out step Burnett and Lowrey
     into a lobby full of cops. Lowrey goes straight to the
     front desk.
                            LOWREY
              Eddie Dominguez. I want his
              phone calls.
     He flashes a badge.
                            HOTEL CLERK
              You pay the bill you can see
              his phone calls.
                               LOWREY
              I'm sorry.     Maybe I wasn't polite
              enough.
     With a flashing right jab, Lowrey pops the snooty Clerk.
     After the Clerk finds his feet, eyes peering over the
     counter...
                            BURNETT
              I wouldn't fuck with him right
              now.

               Three calls to Lois Fields.
               I'm going to stop by her place
               and tell her a bedtime story.
               You can catch a ride with Howard.
     Lowrey jumps in the car.

78   INT. LOIS FIELD'S MANOR - MASTER SUITE - NIGHT               78

     Replete with balcony and billowy curtains, the old-styled
     madame LOIS FIELDS sits up on her bed covered in pillows
     and exotic stuffed animals. She thumbs an old, leather-
     bound looseleaf binder full of modeling photos and
     resumes.
                             LOIS FIELDS
               I'm sorry, Jimmy. But you can't
               have her. Shelly only models and
               that's all... That's right. Like
               I always say, some girls do, some
               girls don't, and the rest you
               can't afford --

     Suddenly, the power is cut.

     Lowrey eases inside the darkness of the doorway. He
     checks the lights, but the power is off. Slipping the
     radio into his coat pocket, he returns with a mini-
     flashlight and begins to clear a path, doorway by
     doorway, then moving up a wide stairwell.

     MOVING THROUGH the doors of the master suite where a light
     breeze blows through balcony of sheer curtains, Lowrey
     turns ever-so-slowly with his flashlight following a beat
     behind. The beam comes to rest on a bludgeoned body
     laying on the bed amongst huge pillows and exotic stuffed
     animals. The telephone cord is wrapped around her neck.

     his handkerchief. No    dial tone. So he drops the
     receiver and heads out   of the room. But just as he
     reaches the doorway --
     Suddenly -- Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS.
     He jumps.    Reaches down to switch it off when --
     From out of those billowing curtains -- Noah!
     Sledgehammer in hand, he swings at Lowrey, who instinc-
     tively blocks and ducks as the hammer misses and crushes
     the bannister railing. It gives under Lowrey's weight,
     who reaches over and traps the sledgehammer, only to find
     one of Noah's hammy fists battering him behind the ear
     until --
     The rail finally gives way.
     Lowrey falls and crashes onto a Craftsman table covered
     in antique picture frames. It collapses underneath him.

                 Luke?!   Where's my other dog?!
                                 BURNETT
                 Fuck the dog!
     Burnett sees the second dog cowering in the corner.       So
     he lunges over, scoops the dog up.

     As the remaining parts are kicked in from the outside.
     It's Casper, Noah and Kuni!

     BURNETT AND JULIE
     Racing through the apartment toward the back door,
     Burnett wheels with the GUN and FIRES just as Kuni rounds
     a corner with the SHOTGUN. The room ERUPTS with plaster
     spray and NOISE. Julie shrieks, and Burnett shoves her
     through the back door, then spins and FIRES. Kuni
     tumbles and dies from multiple hits.

      One DOG starts to BARK.
                             BURNETT
               Fine time to bark. Where were you
               when they were comin' up the walk?
                      (beat)
               Shit. Bet they got a look at my
               license plates. If you saw him
               again, would you remember the guy
               who shot Max?

                             JULIE
               All I remember is one of them had
               really bad hair. Where are we
               going?
                             BURNETT

              Believe me, it's not a new thing.
              Especially when my life is at
              stake. I read the newspaper you
              know, people disappear all the

              So you choose.

101   INT. LOBBY - NIGHT                                          101
      Burnett walks over to CHET, the doorman, a shifty little
      guy who's always got his hand out. He's sitting on a
      folding chair reading Penthouse Forum.
                             CHET
               Detective Burnett... Mr. Lowrey is
               out...
                             BURNETT
               He told me I could use the place
               tonight...

                             CHET
               Didn't mention it to me.
      Chet holds out his hand. Burnett slips him ten. Chet
      sneaks a peek over at the car, sees Julie putting on
      lipstick.
                              CHET
               Say.   How's that Mrs. Burnett?
      Burnett realizes this is going to cost him more. Gives
      him another ten. But for Chet it's still not enough.
                             CHET
               Your children good? Mr. Lowrey
               says you got a regular baby
               factory goin' over there.

               I'm gonna run you in for extortion.

               Now that I think about it, Mr.
               Lowrey did mention something
               about giving you the key.

      The door opens, Burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark
      for the light switch. Finally finds it.

                             BURNETT
               I forgot I had those switches moved.
               Welcome to Casa del Lowrey.
      Julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but
      impressed by the stylish digs.
                             JULIE
               Nice... very nice. All this on a
               cop's salary?
                             BURNETT
               I uh... I invest.
                             JULIE
               Right. What was your last pick?
               A horse in the number two race at
               Pimlico? Or did a bookie give you
               an inside tip.

               You must be tired --

               I'll ask you this only   once, Mike.
               Are you on the take?    And if you
               say no and I discover   you're lying

               Fair enough. I'm not on the take.
               Satisfied? Good. So... why don't
               you make yourself at home? Here's
               the T.V. remote. Watch yourself

               alike.
                      (switches it off)
               Well, gotta run... There's probably
               a couple of good steaks in the
               fridge for the dogs. Help yourself
               to whatever.

               I'll check on you in the morning.

               through that's about this high.
                      (to his armpits)
               And now there's you, so that makes
               it this high.
      To his neck.

               You mean, you're going to leave me

                               BURNETT
               I didn't ask.
                             JULIE

      Julie steps forward and wraps her arms around Burnett.
      It's a one-way hug. Uncomfortable, Burnett doesn't

               know I told you I wouldn't sleep
               with a man I wasn't going to marry.
               But I've been thinking -- and I
               remember when you said thinking was
               a dangerous thing -- so I started
               feeling... well, lonely. Remember
               when you gave me that key --
      Burnett charges over and shuts OFF the MACHINE.

               could watch the door if you like.
               You know. In a chair. I could
               just sit in it. Outside the door
               like cops do when they're guarding
               shit.

               Just keep an eye out.
      Heads for the door.
                             CHET
               Yeah, I was gonna be a cop, you
               know? Just didn't work out. You
               know? Politics.

      Doris slams the door in his face, LOCKS it.

               If you were a real partner, instead
               of some no-backup, hot doggin',
               car chasin', skirt sniffin'
               motherfucker, I would be gettin'
               down to business with my wife
               instead of stuck in this situation.
                              LOWREY
               Yeah.   Thanks for the get-well card.

106   INT. POLICE BASKETBALL GYM                                 106
      Howard is in sweats, awkwardly shooting free throws as
      his morning workout. Parked on either side of the hoop,
      Lowrey and Burnett patiently retrieve each missed ball
      and send it back to him.
                             BURNETT
               Chief. I tried to set   the girl
               up with a sketch artist  but she
               won't. I tried to get   her to come
               in and look at the mug  books and
               she won't come in.
                             HOWARD
               She'll only deal with Mike Lowrey.
      He tosses a brick.
                             BURNETT
               That's right. So let her deal
               with the real Mike Lowrey! Who,
               I might add, shoulda been there to
               take the call instead of runnin'
               off like a hot dog without any
               backup.
      Howard fires another missed shot. He's so bad, it's all
      Burnett and Lowrey can do to keep from spiking the ball.
                             LOWREY
               Hey. I'm not the one who left a
               strange hooker alone in my
               apartment. You know, she's
               probably on the street sellin'
               all my shit as we speak.
                             BURNETT
               I had to stash her somewhere!
               She's scared shitless... just
               like her dogs.

               the whole thing, take her to the

                             HOWARD
               Not a good idea.
                      (brick)
               Until she I.D.s the shotters, he's
               Mike Lowrey. Could take a coupla
               hours. Could take all day. You
               got a computer with a modem?
                               BURNETT
               Big computer.    Expensive --
                             LOWREY
               Yeah, I got a computer and you
               shouldn't touch it. It took me
               weeks to get it set up the way I
               want it and I don't want amateurs
               messing with it.

                      (brick number four)
               Burnett. I'll have Francine give
               you the user code for the computer
               files and you can run pictures for
               the girl on Lowrey's super duper
               computer.
                             BURNETT
               So what about me? I can't    tell my
               wife I'm shacked up with a   female
               witness! Besides, I think    they
               made my car last night... I   gotta
               stay close to home, just in   case.
                            HOWARD
               Easy. Lowrey moves into your
               house. And you're on special
               assignment.
      Another brick.
                              LOWREY
               No way!   I'm not living in that
               zoo.

      Lowrey and Burnett feel hammered by Howard. Upon
      retrieving his final brick, Lowrey passes to Burnett,
      who feeds back Lowrey with a heel kick to the rim.
      And Lowrey slams the ball home. They exit with Howard
      simply staring.

      Burnett's tossing some things into an overnight bag.
      Theresa watches him, concerned.
                             THERESA
               You never had to go to Cleveland
               on police business before.

               Cleveland's where they collared the
               dealer. And that's where I gotta
               go to testify.
                             THERESA
               But what about us? The
               neighborhood's had all break-ins.
               I won't feel safe if you're --

               Honey. I wouldn't go if I didn't

               know to look after my family...

                             BURNETT
               Yes, Lowrey. I trust him with my
               life and, I most certainly trust
               him with yours.
                             THERESA
               Why don't they send him to Cleveland?
                             BURNETT
               Baby. It's a Federal subpoena.
               I'm the witness. I'm the one who
               has to testify. Case closed. I'm

      Burnett throws his bag in the trunk of the Porsche. He
      and Lowrey trade car keys, the Porsche for the Volvo.

                Bye-bye, Theresa. Be good, kids.
      Lowrey joins Theresa on the porch.    Mockingly he puts his
      arm around her and waves.
                              THERESA
                Why's he taking your car?

                mechanic on the way to the
                airport. The engine  needs an
                overhaul... or will by the time
                he gets there.
      The Porsche heads down the block with a GRINDING of
      GEARS. Lowrey winces and heads for the Volvo when
      Theresa gets in his way.
                              THERESA
                Where you think you're going? I

                That's right. Marcus. Not Mike.
                'Cuz Mike's a cop on a case with
                no time to waste.
      Lowrey's in the Volvo and pulling away as fast as he can.

               Okay. Explain it to me, Elliot.

                             ELLIOT
               The cutting agent is highly
               volatile. You can't cook it like
               you would a pizza. I had to gear
               the ovens down to half-speed.

               We already accounted for that,
               Elliot. It's in our fucking
               timetable. So what else?

      Elliot is uncomfortable. He looks back at WALLY, his
      stoned-looking assistant, before forging ahead.

               There's too much moisture down
               here. The pies are taking longer
               to cook than we originally

                             BURNETT
               We find the dope, we find our
               shooter, too.

               There's some powder in there, too.
               Can you hand that to me?

               Mike? I borrowed a T-shirt and
               some boxer shorts until we can
               somehow get back over to my
               place to pick up some clothes.

117   INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            117

      Burnett exits the closet to find Julie   brushing out her
      wet hair, wearing nothing but what she   described, a T-
      shirt and pair of Lowrey's boxers tied   up with a shoe
      string. This ensemble never looked so    good.
                             BURNETT
               Mug shots. We got mug shots to
               look at. 'Scuse me, I gotta hook
               into the P.D. computer.
      He heads out of the bedroom.
                             JULIE
               Hey, Mike. Who's the guy in all
               the pictures?
      Burnett turns. And there behind Julie is a wall full of
      photos that he's never, ever noticed. Nearly all of
      Lowrey. All ego.
                             BURNETT
               That guy? Well, that's Marcus
               Burnett, my partner.
      Burnett gets closer and must look around until he finds
      the singular photo of the two of them. It's in a shitty
      frame, too.
                             BURNETT
               There's the two of us, see?     Me'n'...
                      (gestures to photos)
               ... My partner.
                             JULIE
               Listen, Mike. I've known a lotta
               guys. And I've seen a good number
               of their bedrooms, okay? But I've
               never seen... I mean, look at it.
               It's like a shrine to him.

               Yeah. Okay. Sure, I can see how
               it looks that way... But you see...
               you see... It's uh... a cop thing.
                      (then it comes)
               That's because I've put a picture
               up there for every time Marcus has
               saved my life.

               I save his life. He saves mine. He's
               got the same thing in his house.
               Pictures of me. More, even. Good
               family man, that Marcus.
                             JULIE
               Okay, but Mike. This is like a
               lot of pictures. I mean, this
               isn't something by the bedstand.
               This is a whole wall... And I know
               Max said you were just friends.
               That's why I was thinking,
               maybe... you could be... gay.
      Burnett reacts, then recovers with...
                             BURNETT
               Me? Gay?   Are you outta your

                             JULIE
               I didn't mean to offend you.

                             BURNETT
               It's a good thing that I'm secure
               in my manhood to see that you don't
               mean that. You know how many women
               I've had in that waterbed? Check the
               waves as they go by. Count 'em.

      Burnett and Julie are sitting at the computer looking at
      mug shots dialed in from the police database. She
      fiddles with, but does not eat her salad, while stealing
      sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty,
      bologna sandwich Burnett is eating.

               The shooter said four days until
               he makes the deal. What else
               did he say?
                             JULIE
               Somethin' weird. Sounded like
               three angels... He wasn't worried
               because he had three little angels
               on his shoulders tellin' him
               something. I didn't get the rest.

                No. At least finish it so I

      Burnett doesn't quite know what    to do with the wad of
      dog poop in paper towels still    in his hand. Julie
      snatches it from him and heads    for the bathroom. Burnett

                kids about --
                              THERESA
                Thank you, but I'll tuck the kids
                in. Say good night to Uncle Mike.
                              QUINCY
                But we want to hear the rest of
                the story...
      Theresa silences Quincy with a look.   Sensing his cue,
      Lowrey kisses the kids.

                              LOWREY
                G'night, gang.
                              QUINCY AND JILL
                G'night, Uncle Mike.

      Lowrey is seated on the couch, loading clips and dressing
      his weapon on the coffee table. As he pours a Coke,
      Theresa appears at the bottom of the stairwell.
                             THERESA
               If you were my husband, I'd
               poison that.
                             LOWREY
               If you were my wife I'd drink it.
                             THERESA
               Twelve years I'm married, Michael.
               And I never let Marcus bring his
               work home.

                             LOWREY
               Just a harmless bedtime story.
               Thought the kids deserved to
               know about the hero they have
               for a dad.
                             THERESA
               We don't need any violence in
               this household and we certainly
               don't need any more heroes.
               What we need is a father and
               a husband.
                             LOWREY
               Husband? Theresa. He's your
               personal errand boy. You beep
               the poor S.O.B. every hour on
               the Goddamn hour? And why is
               it always about some useless
               bullshit that can wait until
               later. I mean, the guy's gotta
               job to do.
                             THERESA
               You wanna know why I page him?
               Because until that phone rings,
               I don't know whether he's dead
               or alive. And lemme tell you.
               Those three minutes I'm waiting
               for him to call back? Those are
               the hardest three minutes for a
               cop's wife.
                             LOWREY
                      (toasts with the Coke)
               Touche, Theresa.

       The CAMERA STARTS ON a beautiful SHOT of Julie sleeping
       in the bedroom, then PULLS BACK AND SWIVELS to reveal
       Burnett on the couch. Gun laid across his chest. He
       lays awake while Luke and Duke sniff at his feet.

       Lowrey unhappily pulls into the parking lot driving
       Burnett's dilapidated Volvo. Ruiz and Sanchez, walking
       from the cars, spot him and laugh as he climbs out of
       the wreck.
                               SANCHEZ
                 Ooh, mean machine, Lowrey...

                               LOWREY
                 You should recognize trunk. It's

               I'm tellin' you, I've      had it with
               this witness. I wanna       go home and
               get back to my life as      it was. I
               got married so I could      stop lyin'.

               Oh, please. Big fucking deal.
               You know what I had to do? I
               drove your kids to school this
               morning. Your son forgot his
               homework. So I had to drive him
               all the way back in that junker of
               yours --
                      (as if looking at
                       Burnett for the
                       first time)
               What's that you're wearin'? Is
               that my new silk shirt? Is that
               my shirt?
                             BURNETT
               Yeah. I know, it's a little big
               on me. But cool. I figure, what
               about it? If I'm gonna be Mike,
               might as well dress like Mike!
                      (singing)
               I wanna be, I wanna be like Mike.
               Swish.
      Lowrey's BEEPER SOUNDS.    He checks out the number.
                              LOWREY
               Ugh.   I gotta call the wife.
                                BURNETT
               The wife?
      Lowrey finds the nearest phone and dials.      Burnett is
      thinking Theresa?
                             LOWREY
               Yeah, what's up, baby. Uh-huh.
                      (pulls out notepad)
               Yeah. Okay. What else? You want
               me do what?
      Lowrey glances over at Burnett who's clearly loving the
      fact that it's Lowrey's turn at errand boy. So Lowrey...

                Alright.
       Lowrey turns to block the phone, depressing the switch,
       but acting as if he's still on with Theresa.
                              LOWREY
                Say, why don't you rent a movie or
                somethin'? Uh-huh.

                              LOWREY
                Marcus, this is crazy. We are

                up this asshole and returning

      Approaching are Burnett and Lowrey, but now they're
      dressed in shorts and T-shirts with bright orange vests
      and caps reading "Water and Power." And as Lowrey knocks
      on the door.

      CLOSE ON HEAVY LINK CHAIN
      Wrapped around a pink refrigerator.    It moves.
                             BURNETT
               What do you think the chain's for?
                             LOWREY
               I dunno. Maybe some kind of
               hurricane anchor.
      They knock again.    The chain jerks slightly.
                             BURNETT
               Well, the anchor just moved.
      Both turn and look. And the chain is moving. At first,
      it simply sways back and forth, then it pulls taut and
      the FRIDGE JOLTS! A deep, GUTTURAL NOISE sounds. From
      around the corner, a shadow grows large. Lowrey and
      Burnett instinctively withdraw their guns and aim just as
      a LION rounds the corner, teeth bared, claws tearing at
      the deck.
      The door swings open.
      Burnett pushes Lowrey inside just as the big cat lunges.

               Listen. The cat don't belong to
               me. It belong to my brother. And
               I don't know where he is.
                             BURNETT
               That's too bad. Because his
               lion's tied to your trailer. So
               you gotta move the beast. Or move
               the trailer.

               Well, little kitty's gonna be

               remember where your brother is.

      Lowrey and Burnett pull up in the unmarked police car.
      Chet is there to help with the door.

      Burnett grabs Lowrey and yanks him toward the elevators.

      Keys in the door and Burnett and Lowrey enter the

                             BURNETT
               It's me, Julie...
      Julie enters from the bedroom, dressed in something hot
      with the tag still hanging from a sleeve.
                             JULIE
               I'll be ready in just a minute.
               I thought I'd have you tell --
      She stalls at the sight of Lowrey, a little spark of
      interest passes between them.
                             JULIE
               Hi. I'm Julie. You must be
               Marcus.
                      (hand outstretched)

               It was my babies, Luke and Duke.
               They get nervous in new
               surroundings. I offered to pay
               for the cleaning, but Mike
               wouldn't hear of it --
      Lowrey spots rings from glasses on the table.
                             LOWREY
               And have you ever heard of a new
               invention called the 'coaster'?

               No. It's not my place. My wife.
               She's a designer. She decorated
               the whole place at a discount just
               for Mike. And when she hears about
               how he's been taking care of --

                       at dogs)
               Off the couch!
      Lowrey chases the dogs into the bedroom. One of the dogs
      runs out with a Cole Hahn loafer in his mouth. They both
      follow him into the bedroom.

      Where the lock on the front door turns. The door opens.
      A mysterious WOMAN in an overcoat, sunglasses and spiked
      heels enters.
                                WOMAN
               Mike?
      The Woman strips off the overcoat -- under which she's
      breathtakingly naked, save for a garter belt and
      stockings. She drapes the coat over the nearest chair.
                             WOMAN
               I'm feeling really nasty right
               now.

      Burnett is first to appear from the bedroom -- and his
      expression goes off the charts. Startled, the woman
      shrugs back into her coat.
                             WOMAN
               Who the hell are you?
      Burnett charges her, instantly ushering her to the door.

      mad Spanish. Finally she stomps off down the hall.

       Julie's confused, to say the least.

                        (to Burnett)

       She turns and exits back into the bedroom. Burnett's
       about to follow when Lowrey swings him outside the door-
       way and gets into his face.
                               LOWREY

                lot wanting to ask you some
                questions.

      stares at it a little too intently. Images flash in
      front of her, the sights and sounds of Max's death
      replaying itself in her mind.
      Snapping out of it, determined, she gathers her bag and
      exits.

      He's been watching the  fish in the tank, but turns back
      toward the bar just at  the moment of Burnett's impact.
      The tank cracks on the  bathroom side and water begins
      draining, unbeknownst  to Lowrey.

151   INT. MEN'S ROOM - BURNETT AND CASPER                            151
      Burnett's gun lays amongst the flapping carp and sea-
      weed on the floor. Both Burnett and Casper go sliding
      across the wet floor and into a stall -- both reaching
      for the gun. Burnett's there a second too late.
      Casper's got the gun. He swings it onto Burnett and
      squeezes the trigger. But nothing happens. Burnett
      in turn, grabs Casper's ears and hammers the big guy's
      head into the toilet until he falls unconscious. Burnett
      picks up his gun.

                Now where's my no good, no back-up
                partner?
       Through the busted fishtank, Burnett catches sight of
       Lowrey, standing at the bar and making conversation with
       one of the club beauties.

       Ferguson and Noah split wide and start their move on
       Lowrey.

       heading right for him.

       Lowrey meets Julie halfway. He's got her by the arm and
       is shouting over the loud music.
                              LOWREY

      Julie pulls the gun from her purse, shuts her eyes and
      starts FIRING wildly.
      BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM!
      The gun bucks and each shot goes wildly high.   Noah dives
      for the floor.

      The room clears around Julie. Noah is back on his feet,
      once again with the gun. But...

      LOWREY
      Launches himself off a nearby table, soars over the
      frightened crowd and comes crashing down upon Noah.
      Both Lowrey and Noah tumble to the floor. Noah's gun
      skitters into the crowd. Noah chases for it, but can't
      find it. But --

      FERGUSON'S

      got a clear shot at Julie. He raises his gun, only to
      find Burnett's pistol at his ear.
                              BURNETT
                Don't even think about it.

      Burnett hits the gas, the CAR SCREAMS around in a tight
      circle just as -- SLAM! -- Noah's sedan backs wildly
      across the road and crunches them. Noah throws a SHOTGUN
      over the back seat of his car and FIRES through the rear
      window. BLAM! Everybody ducks. Safety glass flies
      before Noah shifts gears and drives on.

      Burnett does, hauling through the light. Meanwhile,
      Lowrey has the bubble light in hand, reaches out the
      window to stick it on the roof, but it simply slides off.
      He reels it back in the car and hands it off to Julie.

                        again)
                He's slipping away from me, Mike.
                I can feel it.
                              LOWREY
                       (sits next to her)
                Theresa. Listen to me. Nobody's
                slipping away from you. Especially
                not Marcus. You can take my word
                on that... As for the clothes...
       Lowrey pulls a random item out of a box.   It's hideous.
                              LOWREY
                Okay. Just a minor fashion
                faux paux. Those cappuccinos
                at lunch can do that to you...
                See what else we got here.


181    INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - NIGHT                                 181
       Burnett is preparing the couch with a pillow and blanket
       when he sniffs at the air. Something foul. Burnett
       lowers his nose to the cushions. The smell gets worse.

182    INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - BEDROOM - NIGHT                       182
       Burnett crawls into the bed, fully clothed. This is
       awkward. Julie calls out from the bathroom.
                              JULIE (O.S.)
                I'm really sorry about the dog
                pee. They must be traumatized by
                the new surroundings. I'll pay
                for new cushions.

               That's perfectly alright --
      Julie suddenly flops on the bed, wearing a gorgeous
      nightgown.
                              JULIE
               So, Mike.   Can I ask you something?
                             BURNETT
               Sure.
                             JULIE
               Do you always come to bed with your
               clothes on? Or just when there's
               a woman in it?
                             BURNETT
               I'm on protective duty. And I
               want you to feel... protected.
               So I'm dressed and ready. It's
               okay. I've done it before.
                             JULIE
               Really. You think Marcus would
               wear clothes to bed while on
               protective duty?
                             BURNETT
               Sure he would. It's a cop thing.
                             JULIE
               Oh, I definitely have a cop thing,
               too.
                             BURNETT
               You do?
                             JULIE
               Well Marcus. He's very   something
               ... sexy. And the way I   came in
               tonight, he was throwing  everybody
               this way and that and he  took
               control.
                             BURNETT
               Well, I drove.
                              JULIE
               I know.   You drove well.
                             BURNETT
               I shot the gas tank on the car.

               What's her name?

               Theresa.   Why?

               I'll bet Theresa is takin' care of

               You know, relieve his tension. A
               woman'll do anything to keep a man
               like that. You know what I mean?
               Tonight... made me a little bit
               horny, I guess. I think, maybe.
               It was the car chase. Or the guns
               and everything. I've never shot a
               gun before. Maybe it's the steel
               or something. I'm feeling a
               little... funny.
                               BURNETT
               Funny?
                               JULIE
               I don't know.    Do you feel a
               little funny?

                             BURNETT
               Yeah... I feel a little funny.
                             JULIE
               Not that kind of funny.

      Burnett's out of bed like a shot and headed for the
      living room.

               G'night, Uncle Mike.

      Lowrey's at the window. Parked just down the street
      is the same sedan. He goes for the phone and dials.
      Waits for an answer.

      Lowrey climbs under blanket on sofa, the back of which
      faces the window. Exhausted, he turns off light and
      closes his eyes. A beat. Burnett's face pops up
      furtively in window, his nose pressed against the glass,
      looking for evidence of adultery. He can't see Lowrey
      asleep on the couch. His head drops below the window
      frame, only to reappear in another window. Seeing
      nothing, he moves on.

      gun ready. Without warning, Burnett leaps from the
      bushes onto Lowrey's back.

      LOWREY'S GUN
      Tumbles into the flower bed. Lowrey reels with     an elbow,
      dropping Burnett to the lawn. But Burnett rolls     and
      clips Lowrey's legs. Lowrey falls. Crawls for      his gun.
      Gets hold of it, turns and is ready to fire when    --

               This whole deal has turned you

               She's in the car. Got her cuffed
               to the steering wheel.
      Lowrey could kill now. He's on his feet, grabbing
      Burnett by the collar and shoving him up against the

       grass stains on his clothes, mussed hair. And here comes
       Chet.

                        (pulls him aside)
                 I was thinking that... maybe I
                 could see your gun. See, we
                 don't allow guns up in the
                 apartments. Mr. Lowrey usually
                 checks his, here, at the desk
                 with me... You want me to check
                 yours?
       Burnett pulls his gun. But doesn't hand it to Chet.        He
       sticks it in Chet's face.
                                CHET
                 Oh, okay.   It's just an option.

                jobs, so...
                       (prods the guy)
                So?
                              HENCHMAN
                Okay. All I know is his name.
                Foo-shay, I think. Got this
                heavy French accent. The word
                was he offs drug dealers. And
                there was quick cash for whoever
                had the balls enough to hook up
                with him. I swear, man, watchin'
                your house was my first gig for
                the guy.

       Burnett stands over the Henchman and lifts his defeated
       chin to face him. Burnett has it in him to give the guy
       one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised
       face proves punishment enough.
                             BURNETT

209   EXT. UPPER CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD (CORAL GABLES) - NIGHT         209
      Staked out around the corner are Burnett and Lowrey.
      Each is clearly tired of the other. The silence is
      deadly until Julie breaks the silence.
                             JULIE
               So where's the coffee and donuts?
                                BURNETT
               What?
                             JULIE
               I thought that was the usual menu
               when cops were on stakeout. A
               little caffeine for the heart.
               Some sugar-coated dough fried in
               day old grease.
                             LOWREY
               Man. Will you get off this?
               You're making me sick.
                             JULIE
               Oh, I'm sorry, Marcus. All     these
               hours on the case, you must    miss
               Theresa's home cooking.
                      (near Lowrey's ear)
               Bet last night she fixed you    up
               something yummy and left it    in
               the microwave for you.
      Burnett starts to steam.
                              LOWREY
               Yeah.   Somethin' yummy.
                             JULIE
               I imagine there was something
               yummy waiting for you when you
               finally made it to bed --
                             BURNETT
                      (wheels)
               Listen, lady --
      But Burnett's face    ignites with headlights at their
      rear. Doors open.      Lowrey checks the rear-view mirror.
      He sees two private    security cops named DE SOUZA and
      TOWNE. They split     and approach either side of the
      unmarked sedan.
                                LOWREY
               Oh, man.     It's the fuckin' pretend
               police.

               Be nice. After tomorrow we might
               need 'em for a job reference.
      Lowrey rolls down his driver's window in time to hear...
                             TOWNE
               Well, what do we have back here?
               Looks like we got us two pimps
               and a hooker.
                             DE SOUZA
               Hey, fellahs. Maybe if she does
               us both we'll let you leave with
               your pride intact.

                             LOWREY
               Excuse me. One moment.
                      (rolls up the window)
               Let's fuck with these bozos.
      Burnett nods his approval.   Lowrey lowers the window.
                             LOWREY
               Now, where were we?
                             TOWNE
               Outta the car. Hands where we can
               see 'em. Feet spread.
      Both hobby cops open the doors for Lowrey and Burnett
      respectively. Looks pass between them as they step out
      and assume the positions. And Towne starts by frisking
      Burnett's shoulders.
                             BURNETT
               Oh, that's not how you frisk a
               potential lawbreaker. You gotta
               start at the waistband. See if
               he's carrying a piece.
      Towne stalls a beat, then self-consciously goes to
      Burnett's waistband where he feels a --
                             TOWNE
               Gun!
      Both hobby cops instantly withdraw, their own pieces
      drawn and leveled on Burnett and Lowrey.

                      (very slowly)
               You know, it would be very bad
               if you shot and killed two
               helpless pimps and a call girl...
               But it would be even worse if you
               shot two policemen and their
               witness on a stakeout.
      Looks pass between the hobby cops.
                             LOWREY
                      (slowly turns)
               Now I'm reaching slowly for my
               shield... very slowly... here it
               comes... just about got it...
                      (reveals his badge)
               Ooh, look at that. It's a
               detective's shield! All gold and
               shiny. A smart fellah wouldn't
               fuck with somebody who had one of
               these in his pocket. So... Let's
               see. I guess that makes us
               policemen. And you...
                             BURNETT
               Not.
      He shows his shield. Both hobby cops lower their guns,
      unsure about what's next. Burnett moves in.
                             BURNETT
               Now, some rent-a-cops have
               licenses to carry weapons,  where
               others do not. Which might   you
               be? You wouldn't happen to   have
               those permits handy, would  you?
      From the looks on the hobby cops' faces, Julie can see
      that they don't.
                             JULIE
               Guess we know the answer to that
               one.

               Are you kidding, man? Desi was
               the brains behind the whole
               operation. That's why they
               called their company Desilu.
               Desi was first. Lucy second.

      Coral Gables stakeout. Julie's passed out and, once
      again, sleeping in the rear of the car. In the glow of
      the faltering streetlights and the approaching dawn,
      she couldn't look more beautiful. And from his post in
      the driver's seat, he's looking at her with a longing
      that goes well beyond lust. Then Burnett breaks the
      silence.

               In our continuing report on police
               violence, the most recent incident
               involving two Miami P.D. officers
               remains unexplained by department
               spokesmen. This high-speed chase
               was captured two nights ago by
               our Live Copter 9 news team. And
               while the driver was killed, both
               police officers involved in the
               incident seemed to escape without
               injury.

      In a motherly flash, she's got Chet by the ear and she's
      dragging him over to the elevator. He yowls the whole
      way until he sticks his master pass-card in the elevator
      lock. Theresa lets  go.

               Third drawer down.
                      (as doorbell rings)
               Hey, Julie. Do me a favor and see
               who that is.

      BAD BOYS - Rev. 6/22/94                                98.

      Julie looks through the peephole, then opens the door.
      And there's Theresa. Julie's hip.
                             JULIE
               Which one do you want?     The tall
               one or the short one?
                             THERESA
               Oh, I got plenty in me to kill 'em
               both. But it's the short one I'm
               gonna divorce.
      She pushes past.
                                JULIE
               Thought so.
      Julie watches Theresa charge headlong into --

228   INT. CONDO - BEDROOM - DAY                                   228
      Burnett's stripped to his pants and T-shirt. While
      Lowrey's down to his white boxer shorts. He's talking
      and wiping down his gun with a rag.
                             LOWREY
               Man, I can't wait to see the look
               on Howard's face when we tell
               him...
                      (seeing Theresa)
               Holy shit! Hi, Theresa... honey.
                             THERESA
               Save your crap, Mike.

                                LOWREY
               Mike what?     What'd he do?
                                BURNETT
               Theresa.     It's not how it looks.
                             THERESA
               It ain't Cleveland, neither.
                             LOWREY
               Where's Julie?
      Lowrey pushes past Theresa into --

229   INT. CONDO - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               229
      Where Julie is gone!    The front door is wide open.

230   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - ELEVATORS - DAY                       230
      Julie's inside. She hits the close door button.    But
      Lowrey's there to catch it.
                              LOWREY
                Julie. We wanted to tell you...
                I especially wanted to tell you --
                              JULIE
                You think I didn't know? God, you
                are so stupid! And to think I let
                you use me like you did, Max.
                Why?
                             LOWREY
                Julie --

                              JULIE
                Wait. I know why. Because you
                said you needed me. Jesus, who's
                the stupid one now?
                              LOWREY
                We still need you.
      He reaches for her.
                             JULIE
                Fuck you!
      Julie slams a fist into Lowrey's face. The elevator
      doors shut. Then Burnett comes hauling down the
      corridor with Theresa at his heels. He pounds the
      elevator button.
                              THERESA
                You stayed away from home just one
                night too many, Marcus.
                              BURNETT
                Theresa. She's a material witness!
                It was orders!

231   INT. LOWREY'S CONDO - LOBBY - DAY                           231
      The elevator doors open and Julie makes for exit. She
      sees a cab parked outside, slips back on her spiked heel
      and starts to run for it when --

      FOUCHET
      enters, with Casper and Ferguson to either side.

      They sweep into the lobby, stalling just inside the
      doorway when they realize that their target is right
      there in front of them, frozen like a deer caught in the
      proberbial headlights.
      To the right and left, people at the mailboxes. Chet
      on the phone behind the desk. But he's looking at
      Julie. Then...
                             FOUCHET
               Grab her.
      But the doors to the second elevator open.

      Burnett and Lowrey step out in time to see Julie
      looking to them and the bad guys about to make their
      move.

      WIDE SHOT FROM ABOVE
      Fouchet and his henchmen LEFT. Burnett and Lowrey to
      the RIGHT. And Julie in the MIDDLE. Fouchet is the
      first one to draw down.
                                 LOWREY
                  Julie!   Drop now!
      Pandemonium.

      GUNS drawn and BLAZING. All three villains, plus Burnett
      and Lowrey, diving and FIRING.

      PEOPLE IN LOBBY
      Scream and duck for cover.     Smoke and plaster fill the
      air.

      BURNETT
      Pushes Theresa back into the elevator, making her lay on
      the floor as BULLETS CUT above.

      LOWREY
      Slips behind a pillar as BULLETS WHIZ past.


      JULIE
      On floor.    In the middle.   Crawling for cover when --

      FOUCHET
      With balls the size of Pennsylvania. Two GUNS in hand,
      walks forward with barrels fixed and FIRING. Clips out
      on one, tosses the gun aside, then, with his free hand,
      reaches down and grabs Julie by the hair and lifts her
      until she stands.
                                FOUCHET
                  Let's go!

       With a gun in her side, he backs away and shoves her
       through the exit. Casper and Ferguson follow.

       LOWREY
       Swings around the pillar, gun leveled and running after
       them.
                                 LOWREY
                Julie!!!!
       Meanwhile --


232    INT. LOWREY LOBBY - ELEVATOR - BURNETT AND THERESA        232
       Into the open elevator, Burnett slides his gun over to
       her.
                              BURNETT
                Go upstairs. And don't let anybody
                in but me... Do it!
       Burnett presses the close door button. The doors close
       just as Theresa reaches for him, calling --
                              THERESA
                Marcus, I love you.

233    EXT. LOWREY'S CONDO - DAY                                 233
       Fouchet shoves Julie into a waiting car. All three bad
       guys pile in and the CAR PEELS RUBBER just as Lowrey
       makes the doorway. Lowrey doesn't stop. He doesn't
       even wait for traffic. In nothing but his underwear,
       he appears from the building, turns the corner out the
       door, launches into traffic like a shot, spinning off
       bumpers, chasing Fouchet's car on foot.

A234   EXT./INT. FOUCHET'S CAR (INTERSECTION) - DAY              A234
       Fouchet's car slides into the intersection and stalled
       traffic. To the right: a footbridge. The car swings a
       hard right.

234    EXT. FOOTBRIDGE                                           234
       Where a male nurse pushing an old man in a wheelchair are
       in the way. SLAM! The nurse tumbles up and into
       Fouchet's windshield.

      Empty and spinning.

235   EXT. OTHER END OF FOOTBRIDGE                             235
      Metal pylons imbedded in concrete.
                             FOUCHET
               Out of the car!
      The doors fly open and all three are out in the middle
      of the stalled traffic, Julie being drug along with
      them. The gang cuts down an alley.


236   EXT. ALLEY - LOWREY                                      236
      Turns the corner, running up over car roofs and hoods.
      He lowers his gun and tries to draw a bead on Fouchet
      and the gang. They've got Julie and now they're running.

237   EXT. ALLEY - BURNETT                                     237
      Appears behind Lowrey. Lowrey waves him in another
      direction. Burnett hauls one way. Lowrey the other.

238   INT. BEAUTY SALON - DAY                                  238
      MUZAK. Old ladies getting their hair blued and curled
      when -- BANG! Fouchet and the gang enter. Curlers fly.
      Screams!


      LOWREY
      enters. He dives to the floor as Casper stops and FIRES.
      BULLETS RIP through the salon walls and mirrors. Lowrey
      ends up under an old lady's dress.

239   EXT. OCEAN BLVD. (SOUTH BEACH)                           239
      Exiting the beauty salon and stumbling through a
      crowded cafe runs Fouchet and the gang, mauling their
      way through tables and patrons. Lowrey, only moments
      behind, pushing his way through the same path.

                                                            103.
240   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          240
      Fouchet stops right in the middle. Picks the first
      car that's headed for him. Levels a GUN on a taxi cab
      and FIRES two quick rounds -- BAM BAM!! The driver of
      the car instantly slumps. Ferguson's seen this before.
      He's around to the driver's side of the car, pulling the
      dead man out and leaving him on the street. Casper and
      Fouchet shove Julie inside and they're off again.

241   EXT. INTERSECTION                                          241
      But here comes Burnett. Crossing traffic. He's got no
      gun. So he jumps aboard Fouchet's car just as it gets
      into gear. The WHEELS SPIN. The CAR LURCHES ahead.


242   INSIDE CAB                                                 242
      Ferguson aims his pistol upward. He's about to fire
      into the roof when Julie shoves him. GUNSHOTS RING
      out sideways.

243   EXT./INT. CAB                                              243
      BULLETS RIP to either side of Burnett. Then Fouchet
      stomps on the brake and Burnett tumbles forward and
      onto the pavement.

      CLOSE ON BURNETT
      He rolls, makes it to one knee.   But his other leg
      gives way.


      FOUCHET
      He sees his chance and GUNS the ENGINE. The cab barrels
      at Burnett, who's stuck in the middle of the boulevard,
      about to become instant roadkill.
      Then --

244   EXT. STREET                                                244
      From out of nowhere, here comes Lowrey. Dashing out
      across the boulevard and snatching his partner from the
      deadly grille of the cab.

      TAXI CAB
      hauls on by. Leaving Burnett and Lowrey in a heap of
      their own, both trying to catch their breath.
                               LOWREY
                 Don't ever say I wasn't there for
                 you.

245   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - DAY                           245
      TAC teams and uniform cops swarm around their cars.
      All waiting as Burnett and Lowrey arrive in their
      unmarked car. Howard approaches.

                               HOWARD
                 It's about fuckin' time.
                               BURNETT
                 We lost the girl.
                               HOWARD
                 But you found the dope, right?
                 So let's go get it back.
      A bicycle BELL RINGS. Heads turn. And here comes a
      BOY on his bike, serpentining his way through the maze
      of cars and cops until he gets to Lowrey, Burnett, and
      Howard.
                               BOY
                 Which one of you's Lowrey?   I got
                 somethin' for him.
                               LOWREY
                 At least I'm me again.
                        (hand out)
                 I'm Lowrey.
      From his back pocket, the boy extracts a cellular flip
      PHONE. He hands it to Lowrey. He presses the power
      button and, almost instantly, it RINGS.
                                LOWREY
                         (presses send)
                 Yeah.   This is Lowrey.

      Fouchet lifts his PISTOL and FIRES a single shot.   BAM!
      INTERCUT WITH --

      Julie is gagged and sitting on the floor, scared
      shitless.

249   EXT. MIAMI PD - MOTORPOOL - LOWREY                         249
      He's in a vice.    Duty or the girl.   Then --

               He took some horrible pictures of
               me. I don't remember any of it.
               I'd had too much to drink. I
               wondered if he'd drugged me.
               Later... he threatened to show
               them to my boys... my little
               angels. Said he'd pin the
               pictures up on the grade school
               bulletin boards for all their
               classmates to see if I didn't do

      forks where the garbage appears to be expertly lifted and

      tosses down his gloves and hat and begins stomping off    as
      if he's just quit his stinking job. He's headed right     for
      the henchmen, his mouth moving and spewing and moving    and
      spewing. The henchmen look to each other, not knowing
      what to think. Ready for anything when --

      Both Burnett and Lowrey are right behind the henchmen with
      guns at the base of their necks.

279   INT. HANGAR 3 - DAY                                        279
      Just as Casper and Ferguson give a helpless look to
      Fouchet...

                                                            114.
280   INT. HANGAR 3 - ANGLE ACROSS HANGAR - DAY                280
      The garbage truck barrels through the rear wall,
      instantly colliding with the left wing section of
      aircraft. The wheel assembly buckles and the aircraft
      twists onto one wing. Fuel spills.

281   INT. C-123 (HANGAR 3) - ON BUYER                         281
      Tossed from his seat and thrown across throttle.   The
      ENGINE ROARS!

282   INT. HANGAR - ONE CANVAS-BACKED TRUCK                    282
      The tarpaulin rips and a pallet of cash busts open.
      Money swirls inside the hangar.

283   INT./EXT. C-123 - CARGO DOORS                            283
      Open.   Henchmen ready to kill.   Then --

284   FROM EMPTY DUMPSTER                                      284
      Pop up Burnett and Lowrey. MP5-Ks in hand. They BLAZE
      the cargo doors and CUT DOWN the rest of the Buyer's
      henchmen.

      CASPER AND FERGUSON
      charge.   GUNS BLASTING.

      BULLETS

      RIP across the dumpster, moving up into the truck cab.
      Ruiz and Sanchez dive and roll to either side.
      Meanwhile, the sparks ignite the spilled fuel.
                              LOWREY
                Move it or lose it!
      Burnett and Lowrey climb from the dumpster and run.
      Casper and Ferguson have a clear shot. They level and
      aim, but...
      KUH-WHOOM!
      The FUEL TANK on the aircraft EXPLODES. The truck drivers
      dive for cover. Charging for the open hole in the wall.

                                                            115.
285   INT. AIRCRAFT (HANGAR 3)                                     285
      Inside the aircraft the precious dope catches fire.

286   INT. HANGAR 3 - ON CASPER AND FERGUSON                       286
      Looking through the flames. Shielding their eyes.     Ruiz
      and Sanchez appear from behind.
                                SANCHEZ
               Remember us?
      The two bad guys turn with their guns. The flames
      igniting their already battered faces. But they don't
      turn fast enough. Both cops FIRE in unison. Ferguson
      and Casper fall. PULL BACK --


287   INT. HANGAR 3 - WIDE ANGLE                                   287
      One aircraft ENGINE still ROARING. The money swirling
      and burning, falling from the roof like a fiery rain.
      And --

288   INT. HANGAR 3 - LOWREY AND BURNETT                           288
      Easing through the wreckage, ever-so-cautious.
                                LOWREY
               Julie!
                                JULIE (O.S.)
               Michael!
      Her VOICE ECHOES.

                                                CUT TO:

289   INT. HANGAR 3 - FOUCHET                                      289
      He's handcuffed himself to Julie, dragging her deeper
      and deeper into the hangar. The smoke is getting thicker
      and swirling with the burning cash.

290   INT. HANGAR 3 - BURNETT AND LOWREY                           290
      Signals between the two. They split wider.   Moving
      toward those locked doors.

291   INT. HANGAR 3 - BACK ON FOUCHET                              291
      At the locked doors. He shoves against them in a futile
      rage. Julie begins to choke on the fumes.

                                                             116.
292   INT. HANGAR 3 - SEPARATE SHOTS - BURNETT AND LOWREY          292
      Each placing their faces against their own sleeves.    The
      smoke is thicker, swirling in waves.

293   INT. HANGAR - DOORS - FOUCHET                                293
      Shoving the doors.   Pushing and pushing.    Then --

294   FROM HAIL OF SMOKE AND BURNING CASH                          294
      Appear Lowrey and Burnett. Twenty yards apart and
      closing. Guns carefully aimed. Fouchet pulls Julie
      close.

                              FOUCHET
                I was going to fuck her, then
                kill her. Now it looks like I'm
                only going to do the latter.
                              LOWREY
                Either we O.D. on the air or
                the whole place blows. We're
                dying anyway.
                              BURNETT
                Let her go and you'll walk. You
                can keep the dope and the money.
                       (coughs)
                Just the girl and we all get out
                of here.
                              FOUCHET
                What if I don't have the key.
                              JULIE
                He threw it in the --
                              FOUCHET
                       (yanks her)
                Shut up! It's gone. She's dead.
                Unless you move aside.
      Burnett eases further right. Gun carefully aimed. His
      eyes are stinging. Lowrey goes left. But he's lowering
      his gun.

      FOUCHET
      Pulls Julie closer. Gun at her head. Looking to
      Burnett. While Lowrey is nodding to Julie. Nodding
      for her to --
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              117.
294   CONTINUED:                                                  294
                               LOWREY
                Drop, Julie!
      She drops.    Burnett has a clear shot when --

295   HANGAR DOORS                                                295
      Swing wide and way, way open. Blinding light. NOISE.
      HELICOPTERS. And about fifty cops at the ready. Rounds
      chambered. Rifles leveled.

296   QUICK SHOTS                                                 296

      Fouchet, Julie, Lowrey, Burnett. All with the same idea.
      They bolt for daylight as fast as they can go because --

297   HANGAR                                                      297
      EXPLODES in such a concussion it knocks all four of them
      to the dirt. The hangar crumbles.

298   EXT. HANGAR - CLOSE ON BURNETT                              298
      As he looks back on the conflagration.
                              BURNETT
                Sanchez and Ruiz...
      Then --

      FOUCHET WITH JULIE

      He yanks her back up onto her feet, wild-eyed.   He's
      still got the gun on her.
                              LOWREY
                       (hands up for all
                        the cops to see)
                Don't shoot!!! Hold your fire!!!

      FOUCHET
      Twisting Julie for all to see.    The cops' rifle sights,
      all glinting in the sun.
                              FOUCHET
                I'll kill the girl!!!

      Fouchet raises Julie's hand high in the air to show all
      of them the handcuffs when -- KA-POW! -- a SHOT RINGS
      OUT.
      CLOSE ON CUFFS
      The link is snapped in two by the bullet.    Julie falls
      to the ground. While --
      BURNETT AND LOWREY
      UNLOAD their CLIPS in a CRESCENDO of GUNFIRE.    Fouchet
      crumples in a heap.
                                                  CUT TO:


299   EXT. HANGAR - HOWARD                                       299
      The eye behind the smoking sniper rifle.    He reveals a
      pleasured smile.
                               HOWARD
               Swish.
      Then he turns to Sinclair, who stands only feet away.
                             HOWARD
               Investigate that, asshole.

300   EXT. HANGAR - JULIE                                        300
      She finds her feet and runs to Lowrey. Right into his
      arms. He holds her tight, but she winces from a nasty
      cut on her shoulder.

                                JULIE
               Ow.     This shit really hurts.
                             LOWREY
               Stick around. I'll give you a
               bullet to bite.
      Finally --

      SANCHEZ AND RUIZ
      They appear.   Alive and well. Big grins, helping Burnett
      to his feet.   Brushing him off.
                             BURNETT
               Hey, hey...
                      (then with a smile)
               Let's go get our jobs back.

301   EXT. BURNETT HOUSE - DAY                                     301
      The front door opens and all the little Burnetts come
      screaming out...
                              BURNETT KIDS
                Daddy Daddy Daddy the hero!!!
      ... into the arms of their father.     He gathers them all
      into one big hug.
                                BURNETT
                Daddy's home!
      Behind Burnett appear Lowrey and Julie, arm in arm.
      The kids run to...

                              BURNETT KIDS
                Uncle Mike, Uncle Mike.
      Then...
                                BURNETT
                Baby!
      Theresa framed in the front doorway, looking smashing in
      the outfit Lowrey picked out for her. Burnett ambles up
      the walk into her arms. They hug and kiss, Theresa
      tossing a wink Lowrey's way.
                              LOWREY
                Manana, partner. Peace. Okay,
                kids. Pile in. And watch the
                leather and windows this time?
                              JULIE
                You got a real way with kids,
                Lowrey.

                              LOWREY
                You see anybody complaining?
                                BURNETT
                Hey.    Where are the kids goin'?
                              THERESA
                Didn't you know? We got us a new
                babysitter.
      She kisses him.
                                BURNETT
                You mean...
                              THERESA
                It's quality time, Marcus.

       Burnett shuts the door ON the CAMERA.    The screen GOES
       TO BLACK. Then UNDER CREDITS:

                 Uncle Mike.   I did it!

                         FADE IN:

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

          To establish.
          A school marquee with removable plastic letters reads,
          "GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!" A JANITOR opens the glass and
          starts removing the letters.

          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY

          POP! A Champagne cork hits the ceiling.
          TEACHERS who rarely get to drink at work, jockey for
          position, holding out their plastic flutes. (Note:
          female teachers outnumber male teachers 12:1.)
          PRINCIPAL WALLY SNUR, 40s, balding, faces the teachers.
          He has a habit of blinking hard before speaking.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Well, it's been another great year here
          at JAMS. Who can forget Mr. Pinkus'
          haunted classroom? Sandy, thank you.
          SANDY PINKUS, 40s, sporting a ponytail, smiles, clearly
          enjoying the small compliment.

                         SANDY
          I ain't afraid of no ghost.
          The other teachers laugh.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Or the wild success of...

          VOICE (O.C.)
          Wally, can I just say one quick thing?
          Wally turns to AMY SQUIRREL, late 20s, cute and
          wholesome. Any trace of sexuality she might have is
          wiped away by her adult pigtails. She treats students
          and adults alike -- like students.

                         AMY
          Just wanted to remind everyone the school
          day's not over. So let's keep the
          drinking under control, hmm? That's it.
          Back to you, Wally.
          A bunch of teacher roll their eyes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Thanks, Amy,
          (then, back to his notes)
          . Or the wild success of the book drive
          for the women's prison sponsored by Ms.
          Savicki's class?
          A broad-shouldered teacher with spiky hair, MS. SAVICKI, nods.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          But now as the summer is upon us, it's
          time to not only say goodbye to another
          school year, but to also say goodbye to a
          member of our faculty.

                         (BEAT)
          Elizabeth, can you come up here?
          ELIZABETH HALSEY, mid 20s, pretty and petite, walks up to
          the front. She sports an enormous diamond ring and dresses
          slightly more cosmopolitan than the other teachers.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          You've only been with us for one short
          year, but know that you'll always be a
          part of the JAMS family.
          Elizabeth gives Principal Snur an appreciative smile.
          The Teachers lightly applaud.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          And we got you a little something.
          Wally hands Elizabeth an envelope. She opens it and.
          pulls out a gift card: BOSTON MARKET. $37.

                         ELIZABETH
          Almost forty dollars. Thank you!

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Why don't you say a couple words?

                         ELIZABETH
          Okay. Um... I'm not really good at this
          type of thing so I'll make it quick. I
          know I've only been here a year, but
          there's so much I'm going to miss...

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          Elizabeth sits at her desk, cleaning it out. She's tossing
          the few personal effects she has into a banker's box.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          My students, probably most of all.I'm not
          saying they were little angels, butthey
          were all there to learn and that'sthe
          greatest gift a student can give a teacher.
          Elizabeth's class is horsing around, enjoying the last
          days of seventh grade.
          A dim-looking BOY tentatively approaches her desk with
          his yearbook in hand. He hands it to Elizabeth, who
          considers what to write for a beat, then smiles as she
          signs it.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Elizabeth walks down the hall holding her box.
          SIXTH, SEVENTH and EIGHTH graders all race past her,
          running toward their summer vacation.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          And I wish that I had gotten to know all of
          you better, but between four classes and
          planning a wedding, I had my hands full.
          From the little I do know about you, I know
          that our students are in good hands.
          Elizabeth passes Amy's classroom, where she is carefully
          removing inspirational posters from her walls and rolling
          them into cardboard tubes.

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY

          Three middle school BURNOUTS are smoking weed in a
          thicket on the outskirts of the school property.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          And I can't believe it's all over. This
          year flew by. And even though I'll never
          teach again professionally, I've realized
          that I don't need a blackboard and
          classroom to set an example.
          Elizabeth comes up behind them.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Hand it over.
          The Burnouts' eyes all go wide and they freeze. One of
          the burnouts hands her the joint.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Everything.
          The kids look at each other and then pull out a bag with
          a couple of joints. They hand it over to Elizabeth.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          This was a warning. Next time, I don't
          call the principal. I call the cops.

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

          Elizabeth walks to her brand new MERCEDES. She gets in,
          pulls out a joint and lights it. She takes a huge TOKE,
          and then PEELS out of the lot. She tosses her banker's
          box out the window and extends her hand, giving the
          school THE FINGER.

          ELIZABETH (O.S.)
          Woo-hoo!
          A couple students look at her strangely.

                         ANGLE ON
          The dim-looking kid that had Elizabeth sign his yearbook.
          He flips to the faculty section, and by the picture of
          Elizabeth is her message: "YOU ARE ILLITERATE!"

                         DIM-LOOKING KID
          (struggling to read)
          You are... Illit... Illit...
          Elizabeth's car comes barrelling toward him and nearly
          hits him.
          She accelerates into the speed bumps, almost hitting the
          JANITOR from the opening shot, who's changing the plastic
          letters to read, "HAVE A GREAT SUMMER!"

                         JANITOR
          Slow down!

          CHYRON: BAD TEACHER

          EXT. TOWNHOUSE NIGHT

          A Mercedes with the vanity plate "HIS" is parked in the
          driveway of an upscale neighborhood. Elizabeth's matching
          Mercedes pulls into the adjacent spot. Her license plate
          reads "HERS."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT

          A bachelor pad. Top of the line electronics. Lots of
          black leather furniture. Tacky, but expensive.
          Elizabeth pours two glasses of wine and takes a long sip.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (CALLING)
          Baby Doll?

          MARK (O.S.)
          Coming!
          MARK, early 30s, exits the bedroom in his underwear.
          He's shaved his head to avoid signs of early balding and
          is also a full four inches shorter than Elizabeth.
          Thankfully for him, he has money.

                         MARK (CONT'D)

                         (ANXIOUS)
          Hey! That was a quick party.
          Elizabeth kisses Mark on the top of his head and hands
          him a glass.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah. You should have seen it. What a
          joke.
          She raises her glass for a toast. He raises his.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Here's to me never having to work again.
          And I owe it all to you, Lover.
          Elizabeth takes a big sip.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

                         (FLIRTATIOUS)
          So I made a reservation at Ruth's Chris,
          and then I booked us a suite at the
          Drake, and I thought we could finish the
          night in "anal alley." Hmm?
          Something drops in the bedroom. Mark, alarmed, turns
          towards the door. Elizabeth brushes past him into --

          INT. TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Elizabeth enters to find -- NOTHING. Mark follows her in.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Elizabeth looks around -- under the bed, in the closet,
          behind the door.

                         MARK
          See? Nothing.
          Just then, the wooden chest at the foot of the bed SNEEZES.
          Elizabeth opens the latch to find SHEILA, 23, dressed only
          in a thong, scrunched in the fetal position. She stands,
          revealing LARGE FAKE BREASTS, and steps out of the chest.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (TO MARK)
          Motherfucker!

                         ELIZABETH
          How could you do this to me?!
          I'm sorry.

                         ELIZABETH
          You are buying me the biggest pair of
          yellow diamond earrings they make! I'm
          talking serious blood diamonds.
          Sheila SNEEZES again.
          Bless you.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (TO SHEILA)
          Get out of my house, bitch!

                         MARK
          Don't talk to her like that.

                         ELIZABETH
          Excuse me?
          I love her.
          Mark puts his arm around Sheila. Elizabeth eyes Sheila's
          large breasts.

                         ELIZABETH
          You love her? She's a hooker.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MARK SHEILA
          She's not a hooker. I dance.
          Elizabeth takes a deep breath.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

                         (SWEET)
          Listen, Marky, you made a mistake.
          You're human. I'm human. And this time
          it was you. Maybe six months from now,
          you'll walk in on me. I don't know, but
          probably.
          Sheila SNEEZES again.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Shut the fuck up.
          (then, to Mark, sweet)
          And. maybe I'm talking crazy, but I don't
          want to throw away our life together over
          something like this. We're getting
          married! I'm willing to fight for us.

                         MARK
          I'm not. And you know why? Because
          Sheila loves me -- and not just for my
          money.
          Sheila squeezes his shoulder.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm sorry if I care that my future husband
          can support me. We didn't all grow up
          with a silver spoon in our mouths. You
          can't even imagine what it's like going to
          bed hungry, night after night.

                         MARK
          What are you talking about?! Both your
          parents are CPAs.

                         ELIZABETH
          My parents worked their asses off to send
          me to private school. Do you know what
          it's like driving a Pontiac when everyone
          else gets a Beemer the second they
          menstruate? That shit stays with you.

                         MARK
          It's over, Elizabeth.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          For the record, there's a shitload of
          things that I hate about you, but I still,
          would've gotten married.
          (beat, sweet)
          Because I love you.

                         MARK
          (rolls his eyes)
          I'm gonna need the ring back.
          She grabs her bag and heads for the exit. Mark follows.

                         ELIZABETH
          You sad little troll! I hope you and
          your hooker enjoy chlamydia together!

                         MARK
          Elizabeth. The ring.

                         ELIZABETH
          (not turning around)
          I'm not even listening to you anymore.
          She starts to open the door. He closes it.
          The ring!

                         ELIZABETH
          Like I even want your gay-ass ring.
          She tries pulling it off.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          It's not coming off. I'll go to the
          jeweler's tomorrow.
          Mark takes her hand and removes the ring with ease.
          Elizabeth steps out into the night. The door SLAMS
          behind her.

          CHYRON: 3 MONTHS LATER

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

          A red 1994 Grand Am with a cracked windshield peels into
          the half-empty lot and screeches to a halt. The license
          plate reads "HERS."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Elizabeth walks down the empty hall. It's possible a
          person has never looked less happy to be anywhere.
          FAINT SOFT ROCK plays from an open door. Something from
          inside the classroom catches Elizabeth's eye.

                         ELIZABETH
          (under her breath)
          You've gotta be shitting me.

          TURN TO REVEAL

                         AMY'S CLASSROOM
          The room has been decorated to within an inch of its
          life. Every surface is covered with posters like "Noted
          African-Americans," or "Hispanic American Hall of Fame,"
          or "Women Who Dared." A RED DELICIOUS APPLE has been
          placed on each student's desk.
          Amy, dressed casually in cargo shorts and texas, is trying
          to hang a large "INTEGRITY" poster. She looks over, sees
          Elizabeth staring at her, and immediately lights up.

                         AMY
          Elizabeth Halsey, as I live and breathe!

                         ELIZABETH
          Amy Squirrel.

                         AMY
          I know we barely got a chance to get to
          know one another last year -- what with
          you planning the wedding of the century
          and me juggling all my extra-currics --
          but I just want to say that I'm super
          excited to be across-the-hall-mates.

                         ELIZABETH
          Okay.

                         AMY
          And I know you kinda skated by last year,
          doing the bare minimum thing -- you were
          kind of a lone wolf -- but now you're
          back and I just know that you are going
          to rededicate yourself to the task at --
          Amy notices Elizabeth's bare hands.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Where's your beautiful ring?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          My fiance and I broke it off. I found
          him in bed with someone else.
          Oh my gosh!

                         ELIZABETH
          It was another man.

                         AMY

                         (INCREDULOUS)
          Shut the front door!
          (motioning for a hug)
          Somebody needs a hug.

                         ELIZABETH
          Somebody doesn't.

                         AMY
          Hm. Another time then.
          Elizabeth takes an apple from a desk.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (RE APPLE)
          These washed?

                         AMY
          Of course. I'd never serve a student
          unwashed fruit.
          CRUNCH. Elizabeth takes a huge bite out of the apple.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (MOUTHFUL)
          I thought the teachers got the apples.

                         AMY
          Well, I think the students teach me at
          least as'much as I teach them.

                         ELIZABETH
          Stupid.
          Elizabeth tosses the mostly uneaten apple into the trash
          and exits. It hits the rim and lands on the floor.
          Okey-dokey.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          It's like an asylum -- nothing on the walls. Elizabeth
          reads from a stack of US Weekly's and circles pictures of
          CELEBRITY BREASTS. LYNN, late 30s, the kind of woman who
          spends a lot of time on her internet dating profiles, but
          rarely gets emailed, pokes her head in.

                         LYNN
          Oh sorry, am I interrupting?

                         ELIZABETH
          Um -- kinda.

                         LYNN
          Do you want to grab some lunch?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm in the middle of something, Lynn.
          My treat.

                         ELIZABETH
          Fine.

          EXT. KFC - DAY

          Elizabeth and Lynn sit at an outdoor table. Lynn picks at
          a garden salad. Elizabeth is eating a bucket of chicken
          and drinking a large drink. She pulls a bottle of cough
          syrup from her purse and dumps it into her drink.

                         LYNN
          You have that thing going around, huh?

                         ELIZABETH

                         LYNN
          Are you excited for tomorrow?

                         ELIZABETH
          Is tomorrow Saturday?

                         LYNN
          No, it's the first day of school.

                         ELIZABETH
          Wait, I thought I had a week to get my
          class together.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         LYNN
          Yeah, that was last week.

                         ELIZABETH
          (under her breath)
          Fuck my ass.

                         LYNN
          If you hate teaching so much, why don't
          you just get another job?

                         ELIZABETH
          And do what? Sell perfume at the mall?
          Work at a day care center?
          (slurps her big gulp)
          You know, when I first got into teaching,
          I thought I was doing it for all the
          right reasons: short hours, summers off,
          no accountability.

                         LYNN
          I love my summers. Fresh corn. Mmm.

                         ELIZABETH
          From now on, my full-time job will be
          finding a guy who will take care of me --

                         LYNN
          Oh god, I pray for that --

                         ELIZABETH
          And that makes a shit ton of money and
          doesn't ask too many questions.
          (licking her fingers)
          I spent most of my summer hanging out at
          the bars near where the Bulls practice.
          Had some fun, got some cool souvenirs that
          I Ebayed, but those guys aren't looking to
          settle down. And they all wear condoms.
          And then they take the condoms with them.
          That's how paranoid they are that a girl
          will try and get pregnant. Like it's so
          easy to get pregnant from a guy nutting
          into a condom.

                         LYNN
          You're gonna find someone great.

                         ELIZABETH
          I've been thinking about it a lot. I mean,
          I figure I'm like an 8, 8.5. But once I
          get my new tits, I'll probably be a --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         LYNN
          You don't want to do that. You're
          already so pretty.

                         ELIZABETH
          I know I'm hot, Lynn, but I don't stand a
          chance against all those Barbies dolls
          out there. Anna Nicole had it right, may
          she rest in peace.
          Lynn checks her watch.

                         LYNN
          We should finish up. Wally's doing that big
          orientation for teachers in the auditorium.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, I'm not going to that.

                         LYNN
          But it's mandatory.

                         ELIZABETH
          ("I'm so scared")
          Ooohhh...

                         LYNN
          Yeah, I probably won't go either. I
          don't know I might. I'll probably go,
          but just sit in the back. Maybe leave
          early. Maybe stay till the end. Play it
          by ear. Or just stay till the end.
          Lynn takes both their, trays and dumps them.

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          This was fun.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, it was alright. When you said you
          were taking me to lunch, I kinda thought it
          was going to be nicer, but this was okay.

                         LYNN
          Sorry.

                         ELIZABETH
          It's okay. You can get me next time.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Not much character, not many furnishings.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Elizabeth is online looking at a PORN SITE. She stares
          at the SCREEN and compares breasts to the ones in US
          Weekly. She reaches for a bong and pulls a huge hit.
          The front door opens and her roommate, KIRK, early 30s,
          boarish and carrying a tattered backpack and a Big Gulp,
          walks quickly past Elizabeth.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hey, Kirk, what do you think about me
          with Jessica Simpson's tits?
          He stares at her chest intently. She's not bothered by it.
          Go bigger.
          Kirk enters his bedroom and slams the door.

                         ELIZABETH
          Cool, yeah.
          She glances at the clock: 3:14 AM.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           (under her breath)
          Fuck my ass.

           INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Elizabeth is asleep. After a beat, the ALARM goes off.
          She checks the clock: 5.:15. She groans.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          First day of school excitement. The bell RINGS, and like
          rats, the KIDS scurry to their various classes. Before
          long, the hallway is empty.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MORNING

          In one corner, CHASE, clearly at the top of the seventh
          grade food chain, shows off a photo spread of herself
          modelling in a "Western-Style" clothing catalogue.
          GARRETT, 12, wearing grey, stained sweatpants and a grey
          sweatshirt with block letters that read "GYMNASTICS,"
          stares longingly at Chase from a few desks away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         CHASE
          The photographer was, like, sooo nice.
          He made me feel sooo comfortable.

                         (THEN)
          I might get flown to Kansas City for
          their fashion week.

                         GARRETT

                         (RIVETED)
          Oh my.
          Chase and her friends turn to face Garrett, who's as
          surprised as they are that he spoke.

                         CHASE
          Stalk much?
          Garrett quickly turns away. Chase rolls her eyes. An
          angry-looking kid, TRISTAN, wearing a MICHAEL VICK
          JERSEY, turns to Garrett.

                         TRISTAN

                         (FAKE SNEEZING)
          Faggot.

                         GARRETT

                         (EARNEST)
          Bless you.

                         TRISTAN
          What'd you say to me?
          Elizabeth, with large bags under her eyes, enters the
          class. Tristan, on a dime, heads back to his seat.
          The class immediately quiets down. SASHA, 12, dressed
          like a paralegal, walks up to Elizabeth with a large
          Tupperware tray.

                         SASHA
          Hi, I'm Sasha. It's a pleasure to meet
          you.
          (handing over tupperware)
          My mother baked these for you.

                         ELIZABETH
          (not looking up)
          Just leave them on the desk.
          Sasha, confused, gently puts them down and stands there.
          After a moment, Elizabeth looks up.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You need something?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          - Sasha shakes her head and retreats to her desk at the
          front of the class.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Anyone here seen "Stand and Deliver?"
          Show of hands.
          (off their blank stares)
          No one? Edward James Olmos? Wow.
          Elizabeth takes a DVD from her bag. She points to two
          KIDS in the front of the class.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You and you, go grab the TV and roll it
          up front.
          (pointing to Sasha)
          And you, go shut off the lights.
          The two kids, SHAWN and SPENCER, roll the TV over. Sasha
          shuts off the LIGHTS.

                         SASHA
          We're watching a movie on the first day?

                         CHASE

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          I think it's awesome. You rock.

                         GARRETT
          I agree with Chase.
          Elizabeth pops in the DVD. "Stand and Deliver," starring
          Edward James Olmos as a tough-as-nails calculus teacher
          in an inner-city school begins. Elizabeth takes a bite
          of one of Sasha's cookies and immediately spits it out.

                         ELIZABETH
          Ugh. Oatmeal raisin?
          She pushes the Tupperware tray into the trash next to her
          desk. Sasha looks on, sadly.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

          Lunch is in full swing. Each clique has staked its own
          territory. Several TEACHERS, Elizabeth and Amy among
          them, are on lunch duty.

                         ANGLE ON
          GARRETT, sitting alone, writing in a journal. Tristan,
          the bully, tosses a bowl of cole slaw at Garrett.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         TRISTAN
          Incoming!
          Direct hit. The cole slaw nails him in the shoulder.
          Garrett picks some of the cole slaw off his shirt and
          eats it. He continues writing. Amy races over to
          Tristan and writes him up.
          Elizabeth watches, bored, struggling to keep her eyes
          open. Amy heads over to Elizabeth.

                         AMY
          Somebody's got a case of the sleepies.

                         ELIZABETH

                         AMY
          Did you see what just happened?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, that one kid hit the other kid with
          the cole slaw.

                         AMY
          You weren't at the orientation the other
          day, but we're doing something new this
          year. It's very exciting. We're
          splitting the cafeteria into quadrants.
          Elizabeth yawns.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          So, anyways, in order for the quadrant
          system to work, it's vital that each
          teacher maintain order within their
          quadrant. Because it's really tough for
          me as head lunch monitor -- or another
          teacher -- to leave their quadrant to
          discipline a kid in another quadrant. I
          know it's a lot to take in. I'd be happy
          to sit with-you after school and explain
          all of the new guidelines.

                         ELIZABETH
          Tell you what. Why don't you send me a
          memo, and if I have any questions, I'll
          come to you.

                         AMY
          Okay, Elizabeth. Sounds like a plan,
          Stan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         AMY (CONT'D)

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Oh, I meant to ask you. Did I hear that
          you were showing a movie this morning?

                         ELIZABETH
          How do I know what you heard?

                         AMY
          Fair enough. Listen, I don't want to
          tell you how to run your class, but maybe
          it might be fun to do some ice-breakers.
          Like "Telephone Charades" or "The String
          Game." Or start doing practice questions
          for the state test. It's never too soon
          to start.

                         ELIZABETH
          Are we gonna have a problem, me and you?

                         AMY
          Oh, shishkebobs, no. If I gave you that
          impression, I am so sorry. Actually, I
          was really hoping that we could be more
          than across-the-hall-mates.

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't know what you've heard, but I
          don't munch box.

                         AMY
          No, of course not. I don't even know
          what that is. I just meant friends.

                         ELIZABETH
          Like getting manicures and going shopping
          on Sundays? Shit like that?

                         AMY
          Yes! Yes! And helping each other out.
          Looking out for one another.

                         ELIZABETH
          That's cool. Tell you what, friend, I'm
          gonna get going. Cover for me?
          Elizabeth doesn't wait for an answer, walks off.

                         AMY

                         (NERVOUS)
          But you can't leave. Lunch doesn't end
          for another...
          (looks at clock)

                         (MORE)

          Seven minutes. Who's going to watch your
          quadrant?

          INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - LATER

          Empty. Elizabeth looks around and spots the "INTEGRITY"
          poster on the wall. She walks over and studies it.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Elizabeth walks down the hallway with the rolled up
          poster. She. passes a man, obviously lost, looking at a
          map. This is SCOTT, 30. Handsome in a wholesome way.
          Elizabeth walks by as he looks up at her helplessly. She
          turns on her heels. Fresh fish.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (VERY FRIENDLY)
          Hi there. You look a little lost.

                         SCOTT
          Hi. Can you tell me where Room 124 is?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'll do you one better. I'll take you
          there.

                         SCOTT
          Oh, you don't have to do that.

                         ELIZABETH
          Will you stop? It'd be my pleasure.

                         SCOTT
          Thanks! I feel like I've been walking
          around in circles for the last fifteen
          minutes.

                         (EXTENDS HAND)
          Scott Delacorte. I'm the new sub.

                         ELIZABETH
          Elizabeth Halsey, 7th Grade Language
          Arts. Welcome, welcome.
          They shake hands a beat too long. Elizabeth notices
          Scott's VERY EXPENSIVE WATCH.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Helluva watch. What's that -- a Jaeger-
          LeCoultre?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SCOTT
          Good eye!

                         ELIZABETH
          Thanks. I love men's watches. It's kind
          of a hobby.

                         SCOTT
          It's a bummer knowing my watch could feed
          a village for .a year, but my grandfather
          designed it, so...

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh? Your grandfather designs watches?

                         SCOTT
          The family business. My mom's maiden
          name is Jaeger.

                         ELIZABETH
          Shut up!

                         SCOTT
          My parents had a minor meltdown when I
          decided to join the Peace Corps and
          become a teacher. But they've been cool
          about it.
          Elizabeth smiles and they start walking down the hall.

                          SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Integrity.

                         ELIZABETH

                         SCOTT
          (pointing to poster)..
          The poster. "Integrity." What a great
          message for the kids.

                         ELIZABETH
          That's why I got it.
          They turn a corner. Garrett wheels his backpack past them.

                         GARRETT
          Hey, Ms. Halsey!

                         ELIZABETH
          Hey... dude...
          She slaps him five. Scott notices, smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         SCOTT
          Man, I can't wait for the day that I have
          my own classroom.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah... So did you and your wife just
          move to town?

                         SCOTT
          I'm not married.

                         ELIZABETH
          Me neither. I was engaged until I walked
          in on my fiance cheating on me. With his
          brother.

                         SCOTT
          That's horrible!

                         (NOTICING)
          Ooh, 124! This is me.

                         ELIZABETH
          Nice to meet you, Scott Delacourte.
          Hopefully, we'll be seeing a lot of each
          other.

                         SCOTT

                         (HALF-JOKING)
          Only if a teacher gets sick. Great
          meeting you, Elizabeth Halsey.
          He heads into the room. Elizabeth cocks her head,
          checking out his ass as the door closes.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Very nice meeting you.

                         CLOSE ON
          A PAIR OF PERFECT FAKE BREASTS. A hand cups them from
          underneath.
          Pull back to reveal DR. VOGEL, 40s, and his receptionist,
          DANNI, probably in her 40s, with her shirt off. Elizabeth
          watches, rapt.

          DR. VOGEL
          As you can see, the weight is evenly
          distributed and there's minimal scarring.

                         DANNI

                         (TAH DAH)
          Dr. Vogel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          DR. VOGEL
          (holding out his hands)
          "Best Hands in Chicago."

                         ELIZABETH

          DR. VOGEL
          Absolutely. Take them for a spin.
          Elizabeth reaches out, squeezes Danni's breasts.

                         ELIZABETH
          Wow. And the nipples are just... I love
          them. I'll take two.
          They all laugh. Elizabeth notices Dr. Vogel'.s watch.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Maurice Lacroix. That's a great watch.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (CURIOUS)
          And how's that going?

          DR. VOGEL
          She's my rock.

                         (THEN)
          Alright, thanks, Danni.
          Danni puts her bra and blouse back on and exits.

          DR. VOGEL (CONT'D)
          So, Elizabeth, have you given any thought
          to size?

                         ELIZABETH
          I was thinking, you know, maybe a D.

          DR. VOGEL
          IJh huh, uh huh. I ,would say, though,
          with your frame, you might consider
          something smaller. A large B, maybe a C
          cup. You'd be surprised how significant
          those would look.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll go with the D's,
          really turn some heads.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          DR. VOGEL
          You know, Elizabeth, breast enhancement's
          not a cure-all. I just want to make sure
          you have realistic expectations.

                         ELIZABETH
          Doctor, I lost my fiance to a woman with
          monster fake tits. So now I need monster
          fake tits so that I won't lose my next
          fiance. Those are my expectations. Is
          that realistic enough for you?

          DR. VOGEL
          Very good then.

          INT. DR. VOGEL'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - DAY

          Elizabeth leans over the counter and grabs a mint from a
          small bowl. Danni sits behind her desk wearing a headset.

                         DANNI
          So you'll be off your feet for about two
          weeks... what works for you?

                         ELIZABETH
          Let's do December 19th. Start of winter
          break.

                         DANNI
          The 19th it is. So the total is $9300
          for the surgery plus one night stay at
          our facility. How would you like to pay?
          Elizabeth laughs. Danni laughs.

                         ELIZABETH
          That's absurd. What if I don't spend the
          night at your facility?

                         DANNI
          The night's included in the price. Did
          you not read our literature?

                         ELIZABETH
          No.
          A MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR walks by.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          (flirtatious, to doctor)
          Hi...
          (then, back to Danni)
          Listen, I'm a teacher, not a drug dealer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.

                         DANNI
          We accept all major credit cards.

                         ELIZABETH
          My credit situation is complicated.

                         DANNI
          I'm sorry, but if you can't pay, I can't
          schedule the appointment.

                         (LEANING IN)
          You know, there are less expensive
          options. Have you looked into South
          America?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'll be back.
          Elizabeth dramatically scoops a handful of mints from the
          bowl and storms out.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Elizabeth, her cell phone cradled to her ear, pulls a
          LEAN CUISINE out of a freezer STOCKED with them.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ON PHONE)
          Look, I just really need some money.
          It's, for a surgery I need.
          Elizabeth pokes holes in the Lean Cuisine with a knife
          and turns on the microwave.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

                         (ON PHONE)
          Yes, as a matter of fact, it is about my
          breasts, dad.

                         (BEAT)
          Sorry. Happy belated birthday. So, can you
          wire me some money or not?

          EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

          Elizabeth walks up a driveway and looks around.

                         ELIZABETH
          (on phone, whispering)
          So I won't beat around the bush, Grammy.
          She pulls the kitchen knife from her bag and SLASHES the
          back tire of a late-model CAMRY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          (on phone, whispering)
          I'm dying and I need money for surgery.
          Really? Nothing? Don't you get social
          security or something?
          Elizabeth goes around to another tire. Slash.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - LATER

          Elizabeth is still on the phone. CLOSE ON her computer
          screen. Her checking account balance: $45.66.

                         ELIZABETH
          (into phone, losing patience)
          Listen, limpdick, you owe me for breaking
          off the engagement. Do you know how
          embarrassing that was?!

                         (BEAT)
          Lover, I don't want to fight. It's just
          10000 dollars and it would really mean
          the world to me. Lover? You there?
          Elizabeth hurls her phone at the wall. It smashes.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Fucking Troll!
          Kirk pokes his head out of his bedroom.

                         KIRK
          Did you call my name?

                         ELIZABETH
          No. I said 'fucking troll.'

                         KIRK
          Oh, I thought you said Kirk.
          He turns and heads back in to his room.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hey, you got ten grand?

                         KIRK
          Nope.
          Kirk closes his door. After a beat, he opens it.

                         KIRK (CONT'D)
          Also, I might be a little short on the
          rent this month. Like, a lot short.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          He closes his door. The microwave BEEPS. Dinner's ready.

          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY

          Elizabeth and Lynn speak in hushed voices in the corner
          by a vending machine. Amy grades papers on a ratty-
          looking couch. She glances up at Elizabeth and Lynn.

                         LYNN
          I don't know. That's a lot of money.

                         ELIZABETH
          I know. And I hate asking a friend for
          money -- especially as good a friend as you.
          This has its desired effect on Lynn.

                         LYNN
          Maybe I could sell that jewelry my
          grandmother gave me?

                         ELIZABETH
          That turquoise crap? Blech. No one's
          buying that.
          (then, catching herself)
          But it looks great on you.

                         LYNN
          Thanks. What about Mark?

                         ELIZABETH
          What type of person do you think I am?!
          That assbag cheated on me. Did I ever
          tell you that he has a mole on the tip of
          his dick?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm just trying to better myself. I
          don't think that's asking for so much.
          Amy walks over.

                         AMY
          'Scuse,me. Just gonna scooch in here.
          She drops quarters into the vending machine, but doesn't
          bother selecting an item. This was clearly her "in."
          She turns to Elizabeth and Lynn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Sooo... I know it's none of my business,
          but I couldn't help but overhear your
          conversation and I just want to say, that
          you shouldn't change a thing. You should
          be happy with the way you are.
          That's true.

                         ELIZABETH
          Huh. Well, do you think mental retards
          should be happy with the way they are?
          Amy stammers.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Lynn, you teach them. What do you think?

                         LYNN

                         (CONSIDERING)
          I've never asked them.

                         AMY
          I would never --

                         ELIZABETH
          We don't all have your tits, Squirrel.
          So maybe you should think before you
          interrupt a private conversation.

                         AMY
          I guess that's what you get for trying to
          help...
          Amy pushes the coin release on the vending machine and
          takes back her change without getting a drink. Amy heads
          back to the couch.

                         ELIZABETH
          That's right. Walk away.
          (then, noticing)-
          There he is!
          Scott enters. All of the female teachers light up.
          There he is!

                         AMY
          Well, look what the cat dragged in!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         SCOTT
          I wish it was under better circumstances.
          Stu Riley's car was vandalized last
          night. Right in his driveway.

                         AMY
          Gang members, probably.

                         SCOTT

                         (QUIET RESIGNATION)
          The public school system failed them.
          Elizabeth and Amy nod vigorously.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          An empty hallway.

          JOE CLARK (V.0.)
          So forget about the way it used to be.
          This is not a damn democracy! We are in
          a state of emergency and my word is law!
          There's only one boss around here, and
          that's me. The HNIC.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          The class is watching "Lean on Me," with Morgan Freeman as
          a tough-as-nails principal in an inner-city school. Amy's
          "Integrity" Poster now hangs above the TV.

          MR. O'MALLEY (ON TV)

          HNIC?

          MS. LEVIAS (ON TV)
          Head Nigger In Charge.
          The bell RINGS.

                         ELIZABETH
          We'll pick this up again tomorrow.
          The students shuffle out. Garrett hustles after Chase.

                         GARRETT
          Quite a film, huh?
          Chase gives him a weird look and then exits with her friends.
          Sasha lingers by Elizabeth's desk.

                         ELIZABETH
          (without looking up)
          What.

                         SASHA
          I'm a student leader for the D.C. trip --

                         ELIZABETH
          Shocker.

                         SASHA
          And we're having our car wash this
          weekend. If you're around, maybe we
          could wash your car.

                         ELIZABETH
          I've got some Mexicans who already do it
          for nothing.

                         SASHA
          It's for a good cause. This year, we're
          trying to get some extra money so that we
          can go on a Duck Tour!
          She hands Elizabeth a flyer. Elizabeth glances at it.

                         SASHA (CONT'D)

                         (SHRUGS)
          Last year's seventh grade raised $6000.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (SUDDENLY INTERESTED)

          $6000?

          INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY

          Elizabeth walks past the SCHOOL SECRETARY toward the
          Principal's office.

                         SCHOOL SECRETARY
          You can't go in there. He's with a
          student.
          Elizabeth ignores her, adjusts her blouse, and enters.

          INT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY

          The office is decorated with a DOLPHIN motif. Figurines,
          a picture of Principal Snur kissing a dolphin. Dolphin
          calendars. This guy loves dolphins.
          Principal Snur sits next to ARKADY, a small pale kid.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          If you don't like to get wet, Arkady, you
          could try using deodorant, anti-.
          perspirant, maybe some cologne. I know a
          lot of the older boys are wearing the
          body spray.

                         ARKADY

                         (BROKEN ENGLISH)
          Bodish spray.
          Elizabeth enters and immediately recoils from the smell.

                         ELIZABETH
          Blugh!
          Arkady and Principal Snur both look up. He holds up his
          finger -- "one minute." Elizabeth notices his cheap
          dolphin watch.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          So why don't you think about that and
          I'll let your teachers know that you're
          working on it?
          Arkady nods and quickly exits.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sorry, I didn't realize you were in with
          anyone.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          We were just finishing up. Elizabeth, I
          actually meant to talk to you. Did I
          hear that you were showing movies all
          last week?

                         ELIZABETH
          Um... some clips, maybe. I think in a lot,
          of ways, movies are the new books.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Huh.
          Elizabeth tries a different tact. She picks up a dolphin-
          shaped clock from the desk.

                         ELIZABETH
          Is this new? I love it! I think
          dolphins are smarter than humans.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Me too! And if you like that, you'll
          love this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.
          Principal Snur pulls out an "Adopt-A-Dolphin"
          certificate.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT`D)
          He lives in the Cayman Islands.

                         ELIZABETH
          What a great story.
          Principal Snur visibly relaxes. He's sitting across from
          a kindred spirit.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          So what else is new?

                         ELIZABETH
          Actually, I was thinking that I want to
          get more involved.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          What a nice surprise.

                         ELIZABETH
          Specifically, I thought I could supervise
          the car wash.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Amy's been running it the last two years...

                         ELIZABETH
          She just does so much. It might be nice
          to give her a little rest. Especially
          that early on a Saturday.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          I'm so happy that you're dedicating
          yourself and becoming a real member of
          the JAMS family.

                         ELIZABETH
          It just feels so good to help.

          MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. J.A.M.S. - PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - DAY

          Amy stands in the door where Elizabeth was just standing.
          Principal Snur is behind his desk.

                         AMY
          Elizabeth?! For the seventh grade
          carwash? That's bonkers!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Amy immediately regrets saying "bonkers."

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry. I didn't mean to blow my stack.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          I just thought it was nice to see some
          other teachers step up.

                         AMY
          We raised over $6000 last year. That's a
          record. Is this really the best time to
          start experimenting?

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Amy, I see you taking on a.lot of
          responsibility, what with directing
          "Annie" and all your work with D.A.R.E.
          I'd just hate to see you get overwhelmed
          like you did in 2004.
          She stares at him -- clearly, this is a touchy subject.

                         AMY
          Of course. Well, I should skedaddle.
          Looks like someone needs to plan a
          Saturday morning bike ride.
          She turns on her heels and walks out.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN

          Elizabeth is asleep. Her ALARM goes off. It's 5:45 AM.
          She opens her eyes, sees the time, considers for a beat,
          then hits SNOOZE. She closes her eyes. - After a beat,
          the ALARM goes off again. She hits SNOOZE.
          Quick Cuts. Elizabeth hits the snooze button EVERY NINE
          MINUTES until 8:45. She stares at the clock.

          EXT. TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - MORNING

          Garrett stands at the school entrance, holding a giant
          cardboard sign that reads "CAR WASH" as a few CARS pull in.
          Chase, and the other popular girls, are dressed in
          seventh-grade sexy -- they've tied off their shirts.
          The BOYS run around spraying each other, but mostly
          spraying Garrett. Garrett laughs, mistakenly thinking
          that he's part of the fun.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GARRETT
          Oh, I'm gonna get you guys!
          A couple of PARENT CHAPERONES stand in small clusters.
          Tristan, the bully, cocks his arm and aims a soapy sponge
          at Garrett.

                         TRISTAN

                         (NOTICING SOMETHING)
          Whoa.
          The CAMERA FOLLOWS Tristan's gaze. ELIZABETH steps out
          of her car. She's wearing HIGH HEELS, DAISY DUKES and a
          BIKINI TOP. She looks both spectacular and ridiculous.
          A couple of PARENTS look over at Elizabeth, in shock.

                         ELIZABETH
          (calling to Parents)
          Sorry I'm late.

                         MOTHER
          (to other PARENTS)
          I'm going to say something about her
          outfit.
          The MOTHERS vigorously nod in agreement. A DAD pipes in.

                         DAD
          (staring hard at Elizabeth)
          Well, if it helps raise money...
          The other DADS vigorously nod in agreement.

          BEGIN CAR WASH MONTAGE:
          --Elizabeth holds the "Carwash" sign. A LINE of CARS
          forms. An OLDER MAN in an immaculately clean CADILLAC,
          rolls down his window and hands her money.
          --Elizabeth washes in SLO MO, shakes out her hair as she
          gets WET. The BOYS and their FATHERS stare at her.
          --The GIRLS try to mimic Elizabeth's seductive behavior.
          Their MOTHERS run over and pull them away.
          --The Older Man in the Cadillac comes back to have his
          car re-washed.

                         END MONTAGE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

          EXT. TEACHER'S PARKING LOT - LATER

          The carwash is wrapping up. Elizabeth counts money at a
          makeshift table and puts the earnings into a metal
          lockbox. She glances around and then shoves a large
          clump of cash into her DAISY DUKES.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          What are you doing?
          Elizabeth looks up and sees Sasha hiding behind a TRUCK,
          clearly spying.

                         ELIZABETH
          Nothing. Get out of here, Dummy.

                         SASHA
          Are you stealing our money?

                         ELIZABETH
          How dare you?! I'm here early on a
          Saturday for you guys. And for the
          record, nobody likes a tattle tale.

                         SASHA
          I haven't tattled. Yet.

                         ELIZABETH
          Good. Cause if you do, I'll deny it and
          flunk your ass. How will that look on
          your resume?

                         SASHA

                         (TEARS UP)
          I didn't say I would say anything.

                         ELIZABETH
          Alright then. Now beat it. I've gotta
          finish counting this money.
          Sasha walks off. Elizabeth picks up a hose and sprays her.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          See you Monday!
          Elizabeth waves to SASHA'S MOTHER, who eagerly waves
          back.

                         ANGLE ON
          ANY, across the street, watching through binoculars.
          She's straddling her bike and is wearing a helmet and a
          sheen of recently-applied suntan lotion. She takes a sip
          from her Camelbak, and pedals away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON a fish bowl with a crude sign that reads "New
          Tits." Elizabeth drops in fistfuls of crumpled cash and
          then writes in a notebook: $1300.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Amy walks down the hall. She sees Principal Snur slip
          into the bathroom. Amy walks up to the MEN'S FACULTY
          BATHROOM door and waits. The BELL RINGS.

                         AMY
          Shishkebobs.
          She hesitates a beat and then enters.

          INT. J.A.M.S. - MEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY

          Wally is in a stall reading a brochure for a DOLPHIN TOUR.

                         PRINCIPAL:SNUR

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Amazing.

          AMY (O.S.)
          Wally? Are you in here? It's Amy
          Squirrel.
          He instinctively covers himself with the brochure.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Amy? What are you doing? Get out!

                         INTERCUT WITH:
          Amy standing inside. She scrunches her nose at the smell.

                         AMY
          This'll just take a sec. I thought you
          might want to know that Elizabeth Halsey
          showed up at the carwash in a bikini top and
          short-shorts. It was pretty racy stuff.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR

                         (THRU STALL)
          Can we talk about this later?

                         AMY
          (quoting some adage)
          "Later we'll all die, said the gator to
          the fly."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Another TEACHER walks past Amy, looking confused. He
          hesitates and then goes into an adjoining stall.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Look, Josh Gershman's dad called and said
          that the carwash was a huge success. And
          Lauren Rissman's dad called and said the
          kids had a great time.

                         AMY
          I don't want to speak out of school, but
          I happened to be pedalling by and saw her
          get.pretty chummy with the money. ,And
          remember, we barely know anything about
          her. She was a real lone wolf last year.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Are you accusing Elizabeth of embezzling
          from the seventh grade car wash?

                         AMY
          Something about this doesn't pass the
          smell test, Wally.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Well, they raised over $7000, so whatever
          she did worked. And next time you accuse
          a fellow teacher of stealing, you better
          be damn sure. We're done here.
          Amy takes a deep breath. Her face is BEET RED.

                         AMY
          Thanks for the pep talk. Have a super
          day, you two.
          Amy exits. Immediately, there is an IMMENSE ERUPTION
          from the other stall, followed by a sigh.

          MALE TEACHER (O.S.)

                         (IN STALL)
          Christ... I thought she was never going
          to leave.

          INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY

          Sandy, the math teacher with the ponytail, sits at the
          table grading papers. Another TEACHER dozes in the corner.

                         ELIZABETH
          (entering, very friendly)
          Hey! Are those new Doc Marten's?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Sandy looks behind him at the dozing teacher. "Is she
          talking to me?"
          Guilty.

                         ELIZABETH
          How's Period 5?

                         SANDY
          Great, thanks for asking. We got a new
          bassist and we finally got a regular gig,
          which is nice because it's earned. It's
          time to show the world that a bunch of
          teachers can really rock out.

                         ELIZABETH
          Awesome!

                         (THEN)
          Hey, would you mind grabbing me my yogurt
          from the fridge?
          Sure thing.
          Sandy goes to the fridge. Elizabeth pulls visine from
          her bag, and as his head goes into the fridge, she
          squirts the entire container into his coffee mug.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          You should come to one of our shows.
          He hands her the yogurt.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, I can't.
          Elizabeth exits. Sandy sadly takes a sip of his coffee.

                         SANDY
          I didn't even tell you the dates.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          Elizabeth's class is seated. They're staring at her,
          waiting for her to begin.

                         CHASE
          Are we starting "School Ties" today?
          Elizabeth holds up her finger while she finishes reading a

          NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          The camera ANGLES to show that she is studying a picture
          of a topless AFRICAN TRIBESWOMAN with large breasts.
          After a beat, Elizabeth looks up.

                         ELIZABETH
          Alright, today, we're starting "School
          Ties." Classic.
          (then, pointing to a Student)
          You, shut off the lights.
          Elizabeth goes to the DVD player. There's a knock at the
          door and the SCHOOL SECRETARY walks in holding a box.
          She hands it to a confused Elizabeth.

                         SCHOOL SECRETARY
          Here it is. Good luck.

                         ELIZABETH
          Here what is?

                         SCHOOL SECRETARY
          It's the pre-test for the state
          standardized test. It was in the memo.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, yes. In the memo.
          The Secretary leaves. Elizabeth stares at the box.
          Tristan and.a couple kids start making farting noises
          with their hands.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Hey. Zip it. Zip your shit.

                         (THEN)
          Alright, look, we all know these tests
          are gay --
          Elizabeth turns to a student who COULD BE GAY.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Hey.
          Elizabeth passes the box to the front of the class, where
          the kids dutifully take Scan-trons and test booklets.

          ELIZABETH.(CONT'D)
          (then, reading)
          According to this memo, I'm supposed to
          give you forty-five minutes per section.
          Blah blah blah. Clear your desks,
          pencils out and -- begin!
          Twenty-five pencils hit paper in unison.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Elizabeth takes the TV and swivels it to face her desk.
          She turns on the movie, turns down the volume (just a
          little bit) and reclines.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

          Chase and another popular girl strut across the
          cafeteria, arm in arm. A THIRD POPULAR GIRL, saving a
          table, waves them over.
          Chase and her friend walk right past the girl like she
          doesn't exist and take a seat with a bunch of other girls.

          ELIZABETH (O.S.)

                         (MARVELLING)
          Little bitches.

          TURN TO REVEAL
          Elizabeth and Lynn on lunch duty.
          The girl at the table starts BAWLING. Amy, also on duty,
          races over to console her.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          What a phony.

                         LYNN
          Major phony. But she also cares a lot, too.

                         (THEN)
          So what's going on with your boobs?

                         ELIZABETH
          Shit. Shit is going on with my boobs. I'm
          never gonna get married. I'm gonna die
          broke. I should just blow my brains out.
          (then, lighting up)
          There he is!
          Scott walks down the ramp and HIGH-FIVES a bunch of kids.
          He gives them a big wave.

                         LYNN
          I love how his eyes sparkle when he smiles.

                         ELIZABETH
          I want to sit on his face.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, guys.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're really making a habit out of this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         SCOTT
          Ha, yeah. Actually, Sandy Pinkus in the Math
          department, I guess he got that stomach bug
          that's been going around and I got the call.

                         LYNN
          I heard he pooped himself in first
          period. A kid had to walk him to the
          nurse.

                         ELIZABETH
          Lynn, would you mind grabbing me a milk?
          Elizabeth gives her a "can you get out of here?" look.

                         LYNN
          Scott, do you want anything?

                         SCOTT
          I'm good, thanks for asking.
          Lynn walks off.

                         ELIZABETH
          So, Scott --
          Lynn comes back.

                         LYNN
          Sorry, what kind of milk do you want?
          Skim? Whole? 2%? Chocolate?

                         ELIZABETH
          I don't know. Surprise me.

                         LYNN
          Okay, I'll get you skim. No, no, 2%.
          Lynn walks off again.

                         ELIZABETH
          She's funny.
          Elizabeth notices Amy looking at her as she continues to
          console the girl. Elizabeth turns back to Scott.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          So, Scott, I was thinking, I would love to
          hear about your experiences in the Peace
          Corps. I love Haiti. Maybe we could go
          grab a drink some night. Maybe tonight.

                         SCOTT
          Isn't it Back-to-School Night?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         ELIZABETH
          (news to her)
          Yeah, Silly, I meant after.

                         SCOTT
          Cool! Let's get a group together.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, definitely! Or just the two of us.
          Scott looks around, then lowers his voice.

                         SCOTT
          Oh. Um, listen, I'm really flattered.
          You're one of the nicest people I've met
          here. But... I'm actually seeing
          someone.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh?

                         SCOTT
          Yeah, we've been keeping it quiet.

                         ELIZABETH
          Because she's ugly?

                         SCOTT
          No. She's beautiful. She's great. She
          really cares about the kids. It's
          just... when you're dating a co-worker...

                         ELIZABETH

                         (REALIZING)
          Squirrel?
          Elizabeth whips around to see Amy, who's now sharing a
          frozen yogurt with the formerly bawling girl. Amy looks
          up, smiles and gives a thumbs up to Elizabeth and Scott,
          signalling that everything's okay with the girl. Elizabeth
          NOTICES Amy's LARGE BREASTS straining against her blouse.
          She quietly seethes.

                         SCOTT
          Anyways, thanks again for asking me out.
          I'm honored. And I'll take a raincheck
          on that group date. See ya!
          Scott crosses through the cafeteria. Lynn returns with a
          four cartons of milk.

                         LYNN
          Here you go. I got you one of each.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          Lynn hands them to Elizabeth, who takes them, drops them
          in the trash and storms off.

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

          At night, under the stars, the SCHOOL looks peaceful, serene.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT

          Elizabeth is up front. She's staring,at the PARENTS.
          They stare right back at her. It's awkwardly silent for
          a beat too long.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hi, my name's Elizabeth Halsey.
          Soooooo... Any questions?
          Sasha's Mother eagerly raises her hand. Elizabeth points
          to her.

                         SASHA'S MOTHER
          Hi, I'm Sasha's mother. We waved to each
          other at the carwash. I'm a little
          concerned with the importance you're
          placing on movies. What about the state
          test?
          Elizabeth points to her sign on the wall -- "Don't
          Question My Authority."

                         ELIZABETH
          That's exactly what I say to my students.
          Listen, I'm a good teacher. And the school
          hired me because I'm good at what I do.
          (as the parents take this in)
          And the reason your son loves my class is
          because I inspire him. Movies are one
          tool that I use. I also use other
          multimedia techniques, which I'm not
          going to get into right now. Look, I
          could take you day by day through my
          entire syllabus, but that's not how I do
          things. I'm not one of these stuffy
          teachers who's totally by the book. I
          talk to the kids like they're little
          adults. It's about mutual respect. So
          that's my spiel, as the Jews say.

                         (THEN)
          Help yourselves to some delicious snacks
          and drinks in the back. Class dismissed.
          They head to the back of the class. ANGLE ON

                         

                         

                         

                         
          A "refreshments" table. A lonely package of OREOS rests
          against a PITCHER OF TAP WATER.
          Elizabeth tries to sneak out the door, but is stopped by
          a sharply dressed PARENT.

                         PARENT #1
          Excuse me, Ms. Halsey.

                         (EXTENDING HAND)
          I'm Chris' dad.
          From Elizabeth's reaction, she clearly has no idea who
          Chris is.

                         ELIZABETH
          Chris... Great kid -- and precocious.
          You must be so proud.

                         CHRIS' DAD
          Oh, what a relief. I just wish his
          grades would reflect it.

                         ELIZABETH
          If I know Chris, he'll get there.

                         CHRIS' DAD
          Listen, I know you have a full plate, but
          if you could keep an eye on Chris, my
          wife and I would really appreciate it.
          Chris' dad shakes her hand. Elizabeth opens her hand,
          sees a tightly folded HUNDRED DOLLAR bill. She looks
          back up at Chris' dad.

          CHRIS' DAD (CONT'D)

                         (WINKING)
          For supplies. Or whatever.

          JUMP CUT TO:

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Elizabeth stands with another set of parents. They're
          eating Oreos and sipping water.

                         ELIZABETH
          You're Chase's parents? Great kid -- and
          precocious. You must be so proud.
          The parents beam.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          A student like that would benefit so much
          from some extra attention.

                         CHASE'S MOM
          You think we should hire a tutor?
          (then, to Chase's Dad)
          I told you.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (CONSPIRATORIAL)
          I'd be happy to do it myself. It's just
          hard in a class of twenty-five.

                         CHASE'S MOM
          Oh, to be a teacher.

                         ELIZABETH
          It's just so hard, on my salary, having to
          pay for my supplies, my fiance cheated on
          me with his twin sister... and, unlike a
          lot of these other teachers, all I truly
          care about is helping your child learn.
          And as their personal tutor, I guarantee a
          full grade higher -- or your money back.
          Chase's mom takes out her check book.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Make it out to "cash."

          JUMP-.CUT TO:

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER

          Parents are leaving the class, ad-libbing "thank.you's."
          Another SET OF PARENTS surreptitiously hand Elizabeth
          some cash.
          A Bohemian mother, MELODY, wearing a beret, lingers behind.

                         MELODY
          Excuse me, Ms. Halsey. I just wanted to
          introduce myself. I'm Melody. Garrett's
          mom.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (EYEING BERET)
          Nice to meet you... Garrett's a great kid
          -- and precocious. You must be so proud.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         MELODY
          Oh, you're referring to his poetry.
          Thank you.

                         ELIZABETH
          You must be so proud.

                         MELODY
          I am. So so so so so proud. So proud.

                         ELIZABETH
          A kid like that, if I could just give some
          more one on one time, he would just blossom.

                         MELODY
          I'm so happy to hear you say that.
          would really benefit from that.

                         ELIZABETH
          Unfortunately, in a class of twenty-
          five...

                         MELODY
          Ugh. Class sizes are ridiculous.

                         ELIZABETH
          And with the amount they pay teachers...

                         MELODY
          Thank god you love what you do.

                         ELIZABETH
          I guess what I'm getting at is, maybe you
          could help out by giving me a little --
          you know -- somethin somethin.
          Elizabeth offers her hand, palm up. Melody stares back
          at her blankly.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          It's just, it's really tough to teach the
          way that I want to teach when there's so
          little money. I mean, look at this place.

                         MELODY
          You know what I'm going to do for you?
          Melody opens her pocketbook. Elizabeth smiles.

                         MELODY (CONT'D)
          I am going to start a letter-writing
          campaign to the school board, to my
          congressman, to the mayor -- and keep
          writing until you get what you deserve.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          She opens her date book and writes herself a note.

                         MELODY (CONT'D)
          And I'm writing myself a reminder!
          Melody pulls Elizabeth into a warm hug.

                         MELODY (CONT'D)
          You are a saint.
          Melody exits. Elizabeth is left in the classroom by
          herself.

                         ELIZABETH
          So long, Crazy.
          As Elizabeth pulls out the CASH she just made, we hear
          the opening beats of COOLIO'S "GANGSTER'S PARADISE."

                         CUT TO:

          INT. J.A.M.S. - ADMINISTRATION BULLPEN - DAY

          The SONG continues. Elizabeth pokes her head in. The
          office is empty. She walks in, grabs the "Lost and
          Found" box and exits.

          INT. THRIFT STORE - DAY

          The SONG continues. Elizabeth stands across from a
          HIPPIE-LOOKING GIRL. The pile of "Lost and Found"
          clothes are laid out on the counter. The Hippie Girl
          hands Elizabeth some cash.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

          The SONG continues as Elizabeth throws more money in her
          "New Tits" jar and enters a new amount into her notebook.
          The new balance: $1473.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          "Gangster's Paradise" CONTINUES and we see that the class
          is now watching "Dangerous Minds" with Michelle Pfeiffer
          as a tough-as-nails teacher in an inner-city school.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - SAME

          The SONG continues as Amy, in her empty classroom, stands
          against the adjoining wall, her ear pressed to it.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - ANOTHER DAY

          The SONG continues. The class is still watching
          "Dangerous Minds." There's some NOISE in the hall.
          Elizabeth PAUSES the movie, STOPPING the song. She leans
          into the hall.

                         ELIZABETH
          Enough with the commotion!
          The hallway goes silent. She comes back in and UNPAUSES
          the movie. The SONG comes back on.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          The SONG continues as the hallway fills with excited
          kids, who race down the hall and talk animatedly with
          friends. Elizabeth pushes through the center.

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

          The SONG continues. Elizabeth sits in her car. She lights
          a joint with the cigarette lighter and deeply inhales.
          KNOCK KNOCK! The SONG abruptly ENDS.
          Elizabeth jumps. She turns to her window, sees Sasha,
          bundled in her winter coat, waving.

                         ELIZABETH
          (through the window)
          What do you want?
          Sasha motions for her to roll down the window. Elizabeth
          doesn't.

                         SASHA
          Is that marijuana?

                         ELIZABETH
          It is. But it's medicinal. Doctor gave
          it to me. Not that it's any of your
          business.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         SASHA
          Oh, okay. Feel better.

                         (THEN)
          My mom and I made you holiday cookies. Here.
          Sasha pulls out a tupperware container.

                         ELIZABETH
          (peering through window)
          Are those oatmeal raisin?

                         SASHA
          Sugar.
          Elizabeth considers, then manually rolls down the window
          a crack. She grabs the container and quickly closes her
          window. Elizabeth starts eating a cookie.

                         ELIZABETH
          You have anything to drink?
          Sasha shakes her head.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Word to the wise: stop dressing like
          you're running for congress.

                         SASHA
          I don't want to run for congress. I want
          to be president.

                         ELIZABETH
          See? That's what I'm talking about.
          Keep saying stuff like that, you're gonna
          get punched. You really want to be
          President or is that what your parents
          tell to be?
          Sasha shrugs.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You don't have to decide right now. Who
          knows? Maybe you wake up one day and
          decide that you love giving massages and
          you want to be a masseuse. Salary plus
          tips. Think about it.

                         SASHA
          If I think about it, will I get extra
          credit?

                         ELIZABETH
          (shakes her head)
          Hopeless. Watch your feet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Elizabeth reverses. Sasha jumps away from the car.
          Elizabeth peels out, passing the school marquee that
          reads, "Happy Holidays, Jammers! See you in '09!"

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

          Elizabeth rolls over. It's 3:40 PM. She yawns and gets
          out of bed.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S APARTMENT - DAY

          QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth opens her refrigerator. Nothing
          except ketchup packets, mustard packets and soy sauce
          packets.
          She reaches for her bong and tries lighting it. Once.
          Twice. She shakes the lighter. No luck.
          She carries the bong to the stove, turns on the stove,
          and tries lighting it from there. No luck.

                         ELIZABETH
          Seriously?

          EXT. LIQUOR STORE - AFTERNOON

          Elizabeth walks up to the door. It's locked. She shakes
          the door.

                         ELIZABETH
          Seriously?
          She sees a HOMELESS GUY leaning against the storefront.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Why's the store closed?
          The Homeless Guy looks at her strangely.

                         HOMELESS GUY
          It's Christmas.

                         ELIZABETH
          Seriously?
          Elizabeth looks around. The streets are empty. Not a
          person in sight.

                         HOMELESS GUY
          Merry Christmas!

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          Whatever.
          (then, stops)
          Hey, you got a lighter?

                         HOMELESS GUY
          I don't smoke. It's bad for you.
          Elizabeth walks back to her car, empty-handed. A MINI-
          VAN passes. Stops. Reverses..
          The window rolls down. It's Garrett and his Mom.

                         GARRETT
          Ms. Halsey! Hey, it's me, Garrett!

                         MELODY
          Merry Christmas, Ms. Halsey!

                         ELIZABETH

                         MELODY
          Having a nice Christmas?

                         ELIZABETH

                         MELODY
          What are you doing the rest of the day?
          Going to see your family?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (UNCONVINCING)
          I'm probably going to meet up with some
          people. We're having a big potluck, so...
          Elizabeth-shuffles her feet.

                         MELODY
          Ms. Halsey.
          (then, extremely maternal)
          Elizabeth. Would you like to have
          Christmas with us?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. GARRETT'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

          Cozy and unpretentious. Filled with crafts. Elizabeth sits
          next to Melody and across from Garrett, who's wearing his
          "Gymnastics" sweatshirt, and his TWO AUNTS, both divorced.
          Elizabeth tears through a plate of Christmas cuisine.

                         MELODY
          This is a real treat for Garrett. He doesn't
          have a lot of friends come by the house.

                         ELIZABETH
          I find that hard to believe.

                         (CHECKS WATCH)
          Listen, I hate to eat and run, but I've
          gotta head over to the shelter.

                         GARRETT
          I thought we could play board games!

                         AUNT #1
          A shelter. That is so inspiring.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, I love helping bums.

                         MELODY
          Oh, but you have to wait for dessert. We
          have a real treat.

                         ELIZABETH
          If it's cheesecake, I'll stay.

                         MELODY
          It's even better than cheesecake!

                         (THEN)
          Garrett, why don't you run and get some
          of your new poetry?

                         GARRETT
          (feigning. embarrassment)
          Oh god, no one wants to hear it. Oh god,
          I'm so embarrassed!

                         MELODY
          Don't be shy, Marbles.
          Garrett runs out of the room.

                         ELIZABETH
          If you're not really serving dessert, I'm
          gonna have to get going.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         MELODY
          One poem? If you like it, maybe you can
          read it to your homeless friends.

          INT. GARRETT'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

          Garrett stands in front of Elizabeth and his family. He
          opens his journal, clears his throat, and begins.

                         GARRETT
          This is called "The Chase," by Garrett
          Tiara.

                         (READING)
          XOXO /My love for you is XOXO/
          Her hair is long and straight / Isn't it
          great? / About her smile / That I would
          walk a mile for / About her personality /
          That makes me see the best in me / And at
          night when we sleep / Our souls locked in
          deep / So that when we sleep / We can
          stop pretending / And embrace our
          beautiful ending.
          Melody applauds. The Aunts join in. Elizabeth claps,
          then gets up to go. Garrett shakes them all off.

                         ELIZABETH
          She sits back down.

                         GARRETT
          We'll dance our dance / We'll revel in
          romance perchance / One glance / One dance
          / Because together we can achieve...
          (really reaching for it)
          Ba-lance... Thank you.
          He closes his journal. Everyone applauds. Melody looks
          to Elizabeth for a reaction.

                         ELIZABETH
          Junior likes to rhyme.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         MELODY
          Patty, Nancy, why don't you give me a
          hand with dessert -- give them a chance
          to talk about the poem.
          The women exit, leaving Garrett and Elizabeth.

                         ELIZABETH
          So your poem's about that girl?

                         GARRETT
          Chase, yeah. You got the subtext.

                         ELIZABETH
          Can I give you some advice?

                         GARRETT
          Please.

                         ELIZABETH
          Number one, stop writing poetry. Two:
          stop reading it. And three: don't set
          your sights so high. I mean, she's
          really hot. If I were you, I'd try for
          that chubby girl that sits up front --
          the one with the teeth?
          Elizabeth puts her hands to show teeth going off in
          different directions.

                         GARRETT
          But I like Chase.

                         ELIZABETH
          Not gonna happen. Look, I was that hot
          girl. Hotter, even. And I never would
          have gone out with a kid like you. And
          I'm not saying that to be mean. I'm
          saying it to be helpful.

                         GARRETT
          What do you know? You don't-even know
          our names.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'll tell you what I know: a kid who
          wears the same "Gymnastics" sweatshirt
          three days a week isn't getting laid
          until he's 26. That's what I know.

                         GARRETT

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          This sweatshirt was my dad's. It's all
          he left when he left.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         ELIZABETH
          Well, there's a reason he didn't pack it.

                         GARRETT
          (quiet, steely)
          Fuck you.
          Elizabeth pats Garrett on the shoulder.

                         ELIZABETH
          Good luck being a loser. Thank your mom
          for dinner.
          Elizabeth heads for the door.

                         GARRETT
          Happy New Year. Are you spending that
          alone, too, or do you want my mom to
          invite you over?
          She gives him the finger over her shoulder and leaves.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          The students, many tanned, many with braids in their hair
          from their winter vacations, silently stare at Elizabeth.
          She looks haggard. She pulls out a bottle of cough syrup
          and takes a long swig.
          The kids look at each other, like "what is she doing?"
          Elizabeth lets out a lame, fake cough.

                         ELIZABETH
          Shut up.

          INT. WOMEN'S FACULTY BATHROOM - DAY

          Elizabeth is-checking her makeup in the mirror. Lynn
          enters. Her blouse has a healthy serving of vomit on it.

                         LYNN
          Hey, welcome back.

                         ELIZABETH
          What is that, vomit?
          Lynn grabs some towels and blots at the stain..

                         LYNN
          Yeah, and a little blood. The kids had
          too much sugar.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          Anyways, a bunch of us are going out
          tonight to see Period 5 play. Do you
          want to come?

                         ELIZABETH
          Ugh. No.
          Elizabeth heads out. Lynn, still blotting, follows her.

          Elizabeth and Lynn bump into Scott.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, guys. Are you coming to 'In
          Cahoots' tonight? My band's doing a few
          songs. Could be fun.

                         ELIZABETH
          Um, yes! That sounds like a party.
          (then, to Lynn)
          Lynn, do you want to come?

                         LYNN
          Yes.

                         SCOTT
          We'll all grab a drink!

                         ELIZABETH
          Great. I need to get drunk. I mean, not
          drunk drunk. But a strong buzz. Still
          be able to drive home.

                         SCOTT
          (high fives her)
          Now we're cooking with grease!

          We hear the familiar riff of Shawn Mullin's "Lullaby."

          Scott, Sandy (with his hair down), a BALDING BASS PLAYER
          with a yarmulke and a HEAVY-SET DRUMMER, are playing
          their hearts out. This is PERIOD 5.

          Amy, and a couple other teachers are front and_center,
          grooving to the music. Amy sways with her eyes closed.

          Scott joins in, harmonizing.

          Elizabeth and Lynn at the bar.

                         LYNN
          Aren't they terrific?
          Elizabeth eye-fucks Scott. She catches his eye and he
          quickly smiles before nervously turning his attention to
          Amy. Elizabeth watches Amy dance in SLO M0, her BREASTS
          bouncing up and down.

                         ELIZABETH
          (staring at Amy's breasts)
          They're perfect.

                         LYNN
          You should hear some of their originals.
          She turns to the bartender.

                         ELIZABETH
          Two more.
          (then, to Lynn)
          You want anything?

                         LYNN
          No thanks... You know, I was thinking
          that if you still need that money, you
          should.try and go for the bonus. Can't
          hurt.

                         ELIZABETH
          What bonus?

                         LYNN
          For the state test.
          (off Elizabeth's look)

                         LYNN (CONT'D)
          Whichever teacher has the highest scoring
          class gets a bonus. We talk about it all
          the time in the faculty meetings.

                         ELIZABETH
          How much?

                         LYNN
          $5700. Could be good, right?

                         (THEN)
          Let's dance!
          Lynn runs out onto the dance floor and joins Amy.

                         DRUMMER

                         (COUNTING OFF)

          1, 2, 3, 4...

                         SANDY

                         (SINGING "SMOOTH")
          Man it's a hot one / like seven inches
          from the midday sun...
          Amy kicks her shoes off, and starts dancing. Lynn
          follows suit.
           Elizabeth throws back her drink and exits.

          Amy listens to NPR as she pulls into the empty parking
          lot. Suddenly, she SLAMS on her brakes.
          ELIZABETH'S CAR is already there. Amy puts her car in
          park and gets out. She walks over to Elizabeth's car and
          feels the hood.

                         AMY
          Cold.

          The clicking of Amy's shoes ECHO through the empty hallway.
          She stops, takes off her shoes. She pitter-patters down
          the hall to Elizabeth's classroom and PEERS in.

          Elizabeth is at the chalkboard, intently writing
          questions. She senses something in her periphery and
          looks over at her window. Nothing.
          Elizabeth goes back to work.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - LATER

          Elizabeth waits in the doorway impatiently as the kids
          filter in. Garrett brings up the rear, rolling his
          backpack into class.

                         (TO GARRETT)
          Let's go, Sylvia Plath.
          Garrett rolls his backpack over Elizabeth's shoe..
          Elizabeth winces and glares at Garrett.
          The rest of the class enters, stops, noticing WORK
          PACKETS on each of their desks.

                         CHASE

                         (LOOKING AROUND)
          Where's the TV?

          Spencer shrugs.

                         ELIZABETH
          Come on, come on. We have a lot to cover
          so sit down.
          The class, still confused, quickly take their seats.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Alright then. Now. Open your To'Kill A
          Mockingbird to page one.
          The kids slowly take out their books. We HEAR the
          distinct sound of twenty-five book spines cracking as
          they're opened for the first time.

          Good. Now, who can tell me why Jem cries
          when the hole in the tree is filled with
          cement? Anyone?

                         GARRETT
          Because she's a cry baby.
          The kids chuckle. Chase looks back at Garrett.

          Garrett clicks up the handle on his bag and heads for the
          door.

          We're here to learn. Anyone else have a

          Okay, now, what is the significance of
          the Mockingbird in the novel? What was
          Harper Lee trying to tell us?
          No one raises their hand.

          This is as close to real teaching as we've seen from
          Elizabeth. Sasha raises her hand. We see that she
          already has two gold star stickers on her forehead.

          Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, you've
          heard the "facts," but come on, you know
          me. I'm Atticus Finch, baby!
          The class laughs.

                         TRISTAN (CONT'D)
          Come on, seriously. You're gonna side
          with Chase and Shawn over me?

                         ELIZABETH
          Use examples from the book.

          It doesn't matter what race the defendant
          is. You've just gotta look at the facts-.
          Elizabeth nods in agreement. The bell RINGS.

                         ELIZABETH
          Good work today. And don't forget to
          leave your closing statements on my desk.

          Oh shit. Hold on.
          Elizabeth turns away from them and starts rebuttoning.
          Sandy tries to sneak a peek. Scott shoots him a dirty
          look. Sandy gives an innocent shrug.

          (grabs yogurt from fridge)
          I've just been such a mess the last few
          days. Working myself to the bone.

          Yeah, it's been quite a change.

          SCOTT.
          Well, I think it's great. Some teachers
          just sail by, doing the bare minimum.
          It's good to know there are still some
          actual educators out there.
          Elizabeth smiles for Scott, like, "You get me."

                         ELIZABETH
          Well, I should get going. Nice seeing
          all of you.
          Amy and Elizabeth smile thinly at one another. Elizabeth
          squeezes Scott's shoulder as she exits. Amy notices.

                         SCOTT

          And no more movies in class?

                         SASHA
          No, we're actually learning. Did you
          know that Animal Farm isn't even really
          about animals --

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          (then, collecting herself)
          I know you're forgetting something. Do you
          want extra credit on your diorama or not?

                         SASHA
          I want it! Let me think... Oh there
          was... never mind.

                         AMY
          What?

                         SASHA
          It was okay. It was medicinal.

                         AMY
          Wait. Hold your horses. What was
          medicinal?

                         SASHA
          Ms. Halsey was smoking in her car, but
          she told me her doctor prescribed it.

                         AMY

                         (TO HERSELF)
          Holy guacamole.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          SLO MO. Two scary-looking GERMAN SHEPHERDS, their teeth
          bared, pull two POLICE OFFICERS down the hall.

                         POLICE OFFICER #1
          (to German Shepherd, coaxing)
          Come on, Axel, what do you smell, boy?
          The Police Officers continue the search. They lead the
          dogs up against lockers and knock on class doors.
          Amy and Principal Snur watch from the end of the hallway.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR

                         (TO AMY)
          You better be right about this -- or I'm
          going to be getting a lot of panicked
          calls from parents.

                         AMY
          Trust me, Wally. My kids in D.A.R.E.
          tell me everything and there are drugs in
          this school. And not just the students.
          Some of the female teachers.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY

          The class is split up into mini-sections of four desks
          each. The students are quietly and dutifully working.
          As Elizabeth reads papers and grades them, we HEAR the
          various student's voices.

          TRISTAN (V.0.)
          Atticus Finch is a good lawer because
          he's a good person whose a layer.
          Elizabeth looks at Tristan. As she writes, we HEAR --

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          Proofread.

          JUMP CUT TO:
          QUICK CUTS. Elizabeth grades another paper. She's
          growing more agitated and is now feverishly writing.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Wrong!!!

          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Is this English?

          ELIZABETH (V.0.) (CONT'D)
          Are you fucking kidding me?
          Elizabeth crosses out with one line, so it's
          clearly visible beneath. From out in the hallway, we
          HEAR the loud, aggressive BARKING of the DOGS. Tristan
          runs to the door and peeks out.

                         SPENCER
          Whoa. Drug dogs. Cool.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sit down.
          Elizabeth races to the window.

                         ELIZABETH'S POV
          The Police officers and the dogs enter the classroom next
          to hers. Elizabeth glances back at her pocketbook.

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
           (under her breath)
          Balls.
          She races back to her desk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D
          Keep reading.
          Elizabeth takes her seat and leans under her desk,
          obscuring her from her class. She opens her pocketbook
          and pulls out a CIGARETTE CASE. She pops it open and we
          SEE three neatly rolled JOINTS.
          Without hesitation, Elizabeth POPS the first one into her
          mouth and starts chewing vigorously. As she. makes her
          way through the second and then the third, the chewing
          becomes slower and the BARKING becomes louder and louder.
          Elizabeth starts CHOKING as the door opens and the Police
          Officer and the German Shepherd enter, followed by
          Principal Snur and Amy.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Elizabeth, sorry to bother you. This
          will only take a second.
          Elizabeth,. still choking, digs into her purse. She grabs
          her cough syrup and takes a huge swig. Elizabeth wipes
          her mouth, breathes normally.

                         ELIZABETH
          Sorry. I had something caught in my
          throat.
          The German Shepherd continues barking.

                         POLICE OFFICER #1
          What is it, Axel? Where is it, boy?
          The Dog comes bounding at Elizabeth. Elizabeth's eyes go
          wide. Amy licks her lips. The Dog sideswipes Elizabeth,
          almost knocking her over, and jumps onto Garrett.

                         GARRETT
          Ahhh!!!
          The'Police Officer starts rummaging through Garrett's bag
          and pulls out an opened bag of CORN CHIPS.

                         POLICE OFFICER #1
          (holding up Corn Chips)
          All clear. Dog must've responded to
          these. Happens.
          Elizabeth glares at Amy -- "I know you were behind this."
          Amy glares back.
          Principal Snur looks at Amy and shakes his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         AMY
          (grasping at straws, to Garrett)
          Even though that wasn't drugs, junk food
          is still contraband. That's detention,
          Buster.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Enough, Amy. I think it's time we call
          off this witch-hunt.

                         ELIZABETH
          (pointedly to Amy)
          Thank you, Principal Snur. Now if you'll
          excuse me, my class has a state test to
          prepare for.
          Principal Snur, Amy and the Police Officer exit.
          Elizabeth slumps down into her chair, and all at once,
          the combination of WEED and COUGH SYRUP HITS HER.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Whoa.

                         CHASE
          Are you okay, Ms. Halsey?
          Elizabeth takes a long beat before answering.

                         ELIZABETH
          Class dismissed.

                         SASHA
          But the bell didn't ring.

                         ELIZABETH
          Get out of my face.
          (then, to Garrett)
          And leave the corn chips.
          The class uncertainly gathers their things and heads out.
          From outside Elizabeth's window, we SEE the SCHOOL BUSSES
          idling curbside. Elizabeth stares at the papers she
          still needs to grade. The papers stare back at her.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          (to no one)
          But first, a nap.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - NIGHT

          Elizabeth is asleep at her desk. She wakes with a jolt.
          A paper is stuck to her face.
          She looks again at the stack of work, then at the pile of
          things she's already corrected. There's FOUR.

                         ELIZABETH
          Balls!
          She knocks the stack of ungraded papers to the ground.
          After a beat, she collects herself, goes to pick the,
          papers off the floor. As she starts tossing them into
          the trash, something catches her eye: a PRACTICE TEST
          MANUAL. And in the corner, an address:

                         54 LAKEVIEW STREET
          Peoria Il, 61602

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Huh.
          Elizabeth tears off the corner and pockets it.

          ELIZABETH (PRE-LAP) (CONT'D)
          Hey, it's Elizabeth Halsey...

          I/E. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY
          Elizabeth is driving down the highway and smoking a joint.

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          Unfortunately, I can't make it in today.
          My grandmother took a turn for the worse
          and it looks like she's dead.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          The kids are laughing and engaged. TURN TO REVEAL SCOTT,
          dressed in overalls and a straw hat with a piece of hay
          in his mouth, animatedly teaching. He's holding a copy
          of "The Adventures of Tom Sawyer."

          ELIZABETH (V.0.)
          Yeah. So I'm off to the funeral. Wish
          me luck.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          EXT. SIGMA NU - MOMENTS LATER

          Elizabeth knocks on the door. A buff, shirtless guy in a
          backwards hat opens it. He likes what he sees.

                         FRAT GUY
          Hi there.

                         ELIZABETH
          Is Tucker here?

                         FRAT GUY

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Yeah, hold on. T-baaaaag! Someone's
          here.
          (then, back to Elizabeth)
          So you coming to our "CEOs and Corporate
          Ho's" party tonight?
          Elizabeth just stares at the Frat Guy. He turns away.
          Tucker, dressed identically to the Frat Guy but twenty
          pounds overweight, hustles down the stairs. He has a
          tattoo of intertwined teabags around his bicep.

                         TUCKER

          INT. SIGMA NU - TUCKER'S BEDROOM - DAY

          Tucker sits on his bed. Elizabeth leans against a desk,
          unwilling to sit down on anything in his disgusting room.
          BOB MARLEY plays softly.

                         TUCKER
          Do you ever talk to my brother?

                         ELIZABETH
          No. He dumped me, remember?

                         TUCKER
          You and my brother always had the
          histrionics.

                         (THEN)
          So, do you want to come to our party
          tonight? "CEOs and Corporate Ho's?"
          We're kinda light on Ho's.

                         ELIZABETH
          Like I told "Frat Guy #1," I'm not
          interested.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         TUCKER
          Then what's up?

                         ELIZABETH
          I need some date rape drugs.

                         TUCKER
          (hurt, defensive)
          Two things. Number one: who do you think
          I am? Yeah, I like to party and yeah,
          I'm in an awesome frat, but that really
          hurts. And two: they're not "date rape"
          drugs. It's called GHB -- and it's for
          weightlifting. It helps build mass,
          okay? Why do you even want it?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (DEADPAN)
          For lifting.

                         (THEN)
          I have money and I'm in a rush.
          She takes out a wad of cash.

                         TUCKER
          That's all you needed to say. No need to
          get all histrionic on me.
          Tucker walks over to a chest, opens it, and takes out a
          small lockbox. He unlocks it and takes out a small
          bottle containing a clear liquid.

                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
          One capful makes you feel really good.
          Two capfuls will knock her out for a
          couple hours. You don't want to take any
          more than two.
          Elizabeth hands him some cash. He hands her the jar and
          then gives her a big, warm hug.

                         TUCKER (CONT'D)
          Listen, I know you and my brother aren't
          together anymore, but I still think of
          you as a sister, okay?

                         ELIZABETH
          Get your hand off my ass.

                         TUCKER
          Sorry, didn't even know I put it down
          there. Good luck with your lifting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CAR - DAY

          As Elizabeth drives, we HEAR a phone RINGING.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          I.S.A.T. How can I direct your call?

          ELIZABETH (O.S.)
          Hi, my name is Marjorie Goodman and I'm
          calling from the Chicago Tribune. Who
          could I speak to regarding allegations of
          racial bias on your standardized tests?
          A beat.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Please hold.

          INT. T.G.I.FRIDAY'S - NIGHT

          A portly, unkempt man in a cheap suit, CARL HALABI,
          nervously walks through the hotel bar. He sees the back
          of a WOMAN with a RED PERM.

                         CARL
          Marjorie?
          "Marjorie" turns and we SEE that it's actually ELIZABETH,
          wearing the "Little Orphan Annie" wig. She's sipping a
          cocktail.

                         ELIZABETH
          You must be Carl.
          His face lights up, excited to be in the company of such
          an attractive woman. Elizabeth stands and extends her
          hand. Carl notices Elizabeth's very short skirt.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Thanks for meeting me on such short
          notice.
          Elizabeth motions for him to sit down.

                         CARL

                         (NERVOUS)
          You find the place alright? Good drive?

                         ELIZABETH
          Great drive. I love downstate Illinois.

                         CARL
          First time to Peoria?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hmm mmm.

                         CARL
          A lot of people don't know this, but it's
          the largest city on the Illinois River.

                         ELIZABETH
          Wow. I did not know that.

                         CARL
          Yup yup. And it was actually founded
          before Chicago.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hello, Jeopardy! Have you ever
          auditioned?

                         CARL
          (enjoying the compliment)
          No. I should, I should. Definitely
          thought about it.

                         ELIZABETH
          Listen, I'd love to sit here and chat
          with you all night.

                         CARL
          Yeah...

                         ELIZABETH
          But I'm sure you're a very busy man, so
          I'll get right down to it.

                         (THEN)
          I've spoken to various, um, black citizens
          who are alleging that your tests are
          biased towards white people and Orientals.

                         CARL
          (shakes head in frustration)
          You can't use my name, okay?

                         ELIZABETH
          No problem.

                         CARL
          Like I told you on the phone, every couple
          of years, we get calls from all over the
          state with these cockamamie charges. You
          should hear what they call me. And I'm
          not a racist. I voted for Obama.
          (motioning for her to write)
          That, you can quote me on.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, right.
          Elizabeth takes out a notebook and pen and starts jotting
          down notes.

                         CARL
          Look, Marjorie, I know my tests aren't
          perfect. But what's the alternative? I'm
          all for free thinking and creativity, but
          how do you formulate an education budget
          without hard numbers from one of my tests?

                         ELIZABETH
          You don't need to convince me. But you
          know what would help, Carl? For me to
          see one of this year's tests.

                         CARL
          No problem at all.
          Elizabeth lights up.

                         CARL (CONT'D)
          I'll send you one the day after the
          schools administer them.

                         ELIZABETH
          I'd really love to see it sooner. I'm on
          a bit of a deadline.

                         CARL
          I wish I could, but unfortunately, you
          need one of these bad boys.
          Carl holds up a lanyard with a STATE ID CARD and some
          keys attached.

                         ELIZABETH
          Ooh, you look like you're CIA. Listen, I
          totally get it. Enough business for one night.

                         (THEN)
          I'm gonna have another drink before I hit
          the road. What's your poison?

                         CARL
          My poison is the white devil. Wine.
          White wine.

                         ELIZABETH
          Fantastic.
          (then, to Bartender)
          One white wine, one tequila sunrise, and
          two shots of tequila.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

          INT. T.G.I.FRIDAY'S - LATER

          Carl is a little tipsy and slurring his words. Elizabeth
          seems to be fine.

                         CARL
          You know, Marjorie, this is the best
          night I've had in a longtime.

                         ELIZABETH
          Well, that makes two of us.
          Elizabeth gives Carl "fuck me" eyes. He nervously sips
          his drink.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          What turns you on, Carl?

                         CARL
          Everything.

                         ELIZABETH
          You know what turns me on, Carl?
          He giggles nervously.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERS)
          Sex in an office. Getting fucked really,
          really hard against a wooden desk.

                         CARL

                         (SWALLOWS)
          Mine's metal.

                         ELIZABETH
          Even better.

          INT. ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - NIGHT

          Carl flips on the fluorescent lights and they flicker on,
          like dominoes across the ceiling. They enter his office
          and Carl awkwardly leans against the metal desk.

                         CARL
          (gesturing, as promised)
          So this is the desk.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you have anything to drink?
          Carl goes to a mini-fridge and pulls out an already
          opened bottle of white wine.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          White wine in the office. You're a bad
          boy.
          Carl pours a glass. Elizabeth swigs from the bottle.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Do you have any music?

                         CARL
          Um... I could put on some internet radio.
          Carl goes to fiddle with his computer. Elizabeth quickly
          reaches into her purse and pulls out the bottle of GHB.
          She pours a little into Carl's wine. And then a little
          bit more. As he turns around, she hands him the glass.

                         ELIZABETH
          A toast. To new friends.

                         CARL
          To new lovers.
          CLINK. Carl downs his glass.

                         CARL (CONT'D)

                         (NERVOUS)
          I'm gonna take off my shoes. Is that okay?

                         ELIZABETH
          Whatever, man. I'm gonna hit the lady's
          room.

                         CARL
          K, first door on your right. Don't be
          long.
          Carl starts carefully clearing everything off of his desk.

          INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Elizabeth waits in the bathroom. Yawns. Checks her watch.

          INT. STANDARDIZED TEST OFFICES - LATER

          She walks back in. Carl looks woozy. The only thing
          keeping him from passing out is the prospect of seeing
          Elizabeth naked.

                         CARL

                         (SLURRING)
          I wanna fug ya agains dis desk.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         ELIZABETH
          Easy, Cowboy.
          Carl stumbles towards her. Elizabeth deftly moves around
          the desk and exits into the bullpen.

                         CARL
          Marblorie!

                         ELIZABETH
          (as to a child)
          Carl, I'm gonna need you to pass the fuck out.
          Carl smiles as he feebly chases after her. He. stops at
          the photocopier, steadies himself momentarily and then
          passes out, STILL STANDING.
          Elizabeth grabs the lanyard from Carl's neck and heads back
          into his office. She goes over to the filing cabinets,
          unlocks it with one of the keys, and starts rifling. She
          pulls out a folder.

          2009 ILLINOIS STANDARDIZED TEST

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          And bingo was his name-o.
          She walks over to the photocopier and pushes Carl over. He
          collapses on the ground -- out cold. She copies the test and
          puts it back and grabs a stack of scantrons from a shelf.
          She takes a post-it, scribbles something and sticks it to
          his forehead. As Elizabeth exits, the camera PUSHES IN:
          "You were AMAZING. Love, Marjorie."

                         CUT TO:

          Elizabeth stares at the clock. 8:59... 8:59.

                         ELIZABETH
          Okay, go.
          The students open their test books and start. Twenty-
          five pencils hit paper in unison.

                         ELIZABETH
          Okay, pencils down.
          A couple of groans. A couple of frantic moves to fill in
          more scantron bubbles.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Come on, come on. It doesn't even
          matter. Bring your tests up.
          The students dutifully place their tests into a neat
          stack on the corner of Elizabeth's desk and exit.
          Elizabeth waits for all the kids to leave and then slides
          all of the exams into the trash. She pulls out a match
          and lights the exams on fire.
          She then reaches into her bag and pulls out a new stack
          of completed exams. She places the new exams into an
          official-looking folder and exits.

          CHYRON: 2 WEEKS LATER
          Principal Snur is on stage. All the teachers sit in the
          first few rows. Amy stands at her seat.

                         AMY
          If anyone has any information regarding
          the whereabouts of the missing "Annie"
          wig, please let me know ASAP. Because if
          that wig isn't found, you can bet your
          bottom dollar the "sun will not come out
          tomorrow." Back to you, Wally.
          Amy sits. Principal Snur addresses the teachers.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Thanks, Amy. Um, okay, I'm sure everyone
          wants to go home, so I'll be quick.

          Scattered laughter. Elizabeth rolls her eyes.

          (holding up file)
          So I have here the results of the state
          exam -- and I'm happy to announce that
          John Adams Middle School had the fifth
          highest scores in the state.
          The Teachers applaud.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          And I want to single out one of our own,
          who showed that with hard work and
          dedication, one person can make a
          difference. She makes me proud to be her
          boss and she's now $5700 richer. With
          the highest scores in the county -- yes,
          you heard me right, in the county ---I
          want everyone to please give a hand to --

                         AMY

          Oh boy, third year in a row. This is

          This is unexpected.
          All of the color drains from Amy's face as Elizabeth
          stands and waves at the crowd.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          Teachers are exiting the auditorium. Scott catches up to
          Elizabeth, who's marvelling at the bonus check.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, if it isn't Professor Smartypants.
          Scott playfully punches her shoulder. Elizabeth
          playfully punches him back.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (FLIRTY)
          Better not mess with me. I'm a lot
          stronger than I look.

                         (LAUGHS)
          So what are you gonna do with your new-
          found riches?

                         ELIZABETH
          Something big. Maybe two big things.
          Amy walks up and gives Elizabeth a big, fake hug.

                         AMY
          Hey! Ism so proud of you. If someone
          told me at the beginning of the year that
          you -- you! -- would get the bonus, I
          would've said to whomever it was, 'you
          must be joshing me.' And now, here we
          are. Here we are.

                         SCOTT
          We should go out and celebrate.
          (joking, to Elizabeth)
          Your treat?

                         AMY
          What a good, fun idea. Unfortunately,
          Scott and I have to go over the itinerary
          for the D.C. trip. We're the chaperones.
          We're going together.
          (then, quiet to Elizabeth)
          We're dating, so it'll also be romantic.
          You're not dating anyone now, right?

                         ELIZABETH
          I've got my eye on someone, but he's
          dating a major cunt.
          (then, to Scott)
          Pardon my French.

                         SCOTT
          No, she sounds terrible.

                         ELIZABETH
          She is.

                         AMY
          Well then. Scott, we should skedaddle.
          Those itineraries won't schedule
          themselves.
          Amy and Scott head off. Scott turns around.

                         SCOTT
          Rain check on those drinks.

          Danni, the receptionist, uncrumples a BALL OF CRUMPLED CASH
          and counts it. Elizabeth taps her fingers impatiently.

                         DANNI
          Almost done. We don't normally deal with
          cash here. At the doctor's office.
          Elizabeth slides the bonus check across the desk.

                         ELIZABETH
          And this is endorsed. And the rest you
          can put on these.
          Elizabeth slides four credit cards across the desk. The
          MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR from earlier walks by.

                         DANNI

                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          And when would you like to come in?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (TO DOCTOR)

                         MIDDLE-AGED DOCTOR
          Hi.
          He goes into his office. Elizabeth turns back to Danni.

                         DANNI
          And when would you like to come in?

                         ELIZABETH
          Today. Tomorrow. As soon as possible.
          Danni checks her calendar.

                         DANNI
          A week from tomorrow, then?

                         ELIZABETH
          Book it.
          Danni slides Elizabeth a packet of literature.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DANNI
          We have a 48 hour cancellation policy.
          Anything after that, you'll be charged
          50% the cost of the surgery -- unless
          there are extenuating circumstances.

                         ELIZABETH
          I wouldn't miss it for the world.
          Elizabeth pulls her shirt away from her body and looks
          down at her breasts.

          So long, suckers.

          EXT. J.A.M.S. - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAWN

          The lot is empty except for Elizabeth's car.

          INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          Elizabeth enters and pulls latex gloves from her bag.
          She snaps them on. She takes a seat at Amy's desk and
          pulls an apple from her bag.
          Then she pulls out POISON IVY. She rubs the apple with
          the poison ivy leaves and then carefully places it in the
          center of the desk. Elizabeth smiles.

          INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - LATER

          Amy's class is seated. Amy enters and heads for her desk.
          She notices the apple and smiles at her class, touched.
          Thank you.
          The class stares back at her blankly.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Who did this?
          No response from the class.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Oh come on. Nobody wants an extra
          sticker on their all-star board?
          Amy presses the apple to her ear.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          (muppet voice, to apple)
          Who brought you to me?
          Amy places the apple up to her ear.

                         AMY (CONT'D)

                         (MUPPET VOICE)
          What's that, Mr. Apple? You want me to
          take a bite? Alrighty-roo.
          Amy takes a bite of the apple and then addresses the class.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Enough horsin' around, let's get started.

          JUMP CUT TO:

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

          A LUXURY BUS idles curbside. Parents see off their kids.
          Scott and Elizabeth are checking kids in. Principal Snur
          walks up.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          All set?

                         SCOTT
          I think we're good.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Elizabeth, thanks again for hopping in
          last minute. You really saved us.

                         ELIZABETH
          Is Amy going to be okay?

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          She'll be fine. But to be honest, I
          think she was scaring some of the kids.

                         ELIZABETH
          I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's
          in my thoughts.

                         ANGLE ON
          Amy watching from outside her car. One side of her face
          is completely blistered, scaly and red from the POISON
          IVY. The kids have every reason to be scared by her.
          She gets into her car and slams the door.

          Fudge! Fudge! Fudge! Fuuuuuck--dge!

          INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY

          Kids sing BUS SONGS. Elizabeth and Scott sit up front.

                         KIDS

                         (SINGING)
          Hey, Sasha!
          Hey, Sasha!

                         SASHA
          I think I hear it again!

                         KIDS
          You're wanted on the telephone!

                         SASHA

                         (POINTING)
          If it's not Chase, then I'm not home!
          Chase rolls her eyes. Up front, Scott and Elizabeth sit
          next to one another and share ipod buds.

                         ELIZABETH
          (nodding to the beat)
          You guys are amazing. Period 5 is
          definitely going to make it.
          Scott smiles wide. Garrett walks up the aisle. He looks
          at Elizabeth, then turns to Scott.

                         GARRETT
          Mr. Delacourte, do you think we could go
          to the poetry museum?

                         SCOTT
          Oh, um, I don't know, Champ, um --
          Scott looks to Elizabeth, like "please help."

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          (to Garrett, supersweet)
          Oh, honey, I bet everyone would just love
          to walk around and look at all the poetry
          on the walls, but unfortunately, the
          itinerary's really tight.

                         GARRETT
          Why are you talking like that?

                         ELIZABETH
          Just go sit down, sweetie.
          Garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to
          his seat. Scott smiles at Elizabeth.

                         SCOTT
          Wow, you are such a natural.

                         ELIZABETH
          When you love what you do, it comes easy.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

          A splotchy-faced Amy trudges down the hallway. She
          passes Elizabeth's room, stops, walks back to the door
          and peers in. She looks down the hallway -- it's empty.

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Amy rifles through Elizabeth's desk. She opens the top
          drawer. Just pens and paper. She tries the bottom
          drawer. Locked.
          Shishkebabs!

          INT. EMPTY HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Amy drags ELIZABETH'S DESK across the hallway into her
          room. It's a slow, difficult and loud process.

          INT. EMPTY HALLWAY - LATER

          Amy, sweating, now drags HER OWN DESK across the.hallway
          into Elizabeth's room. She stops to catch her breath.

          INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY

          Amy watches as the MAINTENANCE GUY sorts through his keys
          and tries to unlocks the desk.

                         AMY
          (nervous, too loud)
          I never lose my keys!

                         MAINTENANCE GUY
          What's wrong with your face?

                         AMY
          What's wrong with your face?!?!

                         MAINTENANCE GUY
          Just making conversation.
          He finds the right key and opens the desk.

                         AMY
          (buying it back)
          Super! Thanks a bunch, Amos!
          The Maintenance Man exits.
          Amy immediately opens the desk and rummages through it.
          She pulls out the "Annie" wig.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Busted.
          She pulls out a test booklet. There's a piece ripped out
          from the front page. Amy's eyes narrow. She runs to the
          floor, where she has neat stacks of what used to be in
          her desk. She finds her test booklet and compares the
          two, clocking the I.S.A.T. address.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Looks like somebody's in big, big
          trouble.

          Amy, her face still covered in the rash, sits across from
          Carl Halabi, the administrator that Elizabeth roofied.
          Carl is staring at a photo of Elizabeth.

                         CARL
          She changed her hair. Is Marjorie in
          some kind of trouble?

          I think you're the one that might be in
          some kind of trouble! Did you or did you
          not give her a copy of the state test?

                         CARL
          What?! No!

                         (THEN)
          All I did was give her a couple of quotes
          ,for her article and that's it.

                         AMY
          What article?

                         CARL
          For the Tribune. She's a reporter there.
          Right?

                         (RE JEFFERSON)
          I'm so conflicted about this man. Did
          you know that he had slaves?
          Elizabeth tries to dislodge a piece of the fruit roll-up
          from the back of her mouth with her tongue.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, everyone knows that.

                         SCOTT
          I just hate slavery so, so much. An
          unquestionable evil. I hate it.
          Elizabeth continues struggling with the fruit.

                         ELIZABETH
          Slavery's the worst.

                         SCOTT
          If I could go back in time and undo
          slavery, I would.
          Elizabeth gives him a sideways glance, like "no shit."

                         ELIZABETH
          You really hate slavery, huh?

                         SCOTT
          I hate it.
          Elizabeth finally dislodges the chunk of fruit roll-up.

          You get it.
          Scott squeezes Elizabeth's shoulder.

                         SCOTT (CONT'D)
          Thanks for listening.

          me about anything. Slavery, the
          Holocaust, relationships.
          Scott smiles. Elizabeth smiles. They lock eyes -- a
          moment.

          And like I said, she stole the wig. I
          think we're dealing with a criminal
          master-mind.

          You know how much we all like her.

          I know. It's a tragedy. But Amy, let's
          keep this between us. The last thing we
          need is a scandal on our hands.

                         AMY
          You betcha.
          (gets up to go, turns)
          You know what scares me the most? This
          is just what we know. This could be the
          tip of the iceberg. Who knows what else
          she's capable of?

          for their shoes and socks.

          Elizabeth tries pulling off her shirt. Scott pulls it
          back down.

                         SCOTT
          Oh my gosh, I'm dry-humping the shit out
          of you.

                         ELIZABETH
          Erg. Dry fuck the fuck out of me.

          Oh my gosh, I'm so close... I'm... pfft.
          Ugh.
          Scott rolls off of Elizabeth and exhales deeply. There's
          a wet spot on his jeans.

                         SCOTT (CONT'D)
          That was a mistake.

                         ELIZABETH
          That was fast.

          I know, I'm sorry. But this isn't me. And I.
          know this isn't you. I'm in love with Amy.

          But we're so good together. We both hate
          slavery, we both love teaching. And call
          me crazy, but I always imagined us
          spending summers at your family's compound
          in Hyannisport.

                         SCOTT
          I know. And you're awesome and you have a
          huge heart and I love your empathy. It's
          just, when I was dry-humping you, I couldn't
          stop thinking about dry-humping Any.

                         ELIZABETH
          It's because of my tits, isn't it? Well,
          I'm getting new ones in, like, two days.
          Don't make a decision until you see them.

                         SCOTT
          Elizabeth, I think you're beautiful just
          the way you are, even with your flat chest.
          And I think Amy's beautiful. But I just
          have to do what's right. I made Amy a
          promise.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          Scott holds up his hand, showing off a PROMISE RING.

                         ELIZABETH
          What're you -- 13?
          Elizabeth angrily gets up and pulls on her socks.

                         SCOTT
          Wait, Elizabeth. Don't go. Spend the night
          here with me. You can sleep on the other bed.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (FAKE EXCITEMENT)
          Ooh, like a slumber party? I'm leaving. And
          for the record, your band sucks, asstard.
          Elizabeth opens the room door and exits. She tries slamming
          the door, but it's on a spring so it closes very, very slowly.

          EXT. LINCOLN MEMORIAL - DAY

          The kids listen to a TOUR GUIDE on the steps of the
          memorial. Garrett sneaks furtive glances at Chase.
          Elizabeth stands away from the group, on her cell.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (ON PHONE)
          Wally. Why would I cheat? If I'm guilty
          of anything, it's teaching too hard.
          Great... I've got nothing to hide.
          She ends the call.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Fuck!
          Scott, wearing a Thomas Jefferson souvenir T-shirt, and
          all of the students look over at Elizabeth.

          ELIZABETH.(CONT'D)
          What?!
          The Tour Guide looks around uncertainly before continuing.

                         TOUR GUIDE
          And does anyone know what Abraham
          Lincoln's nickname was?
          Sasha's hand shoots up.

                         SASHA
          Honest Abe.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         TOUR GUIDE
          "Honest Abe", that's right. Because
          Lincoln always said what was on his mind,
          even if that meant being unpopular.
          Abraham Lincoln always showed great
          courage.
          Garrett takes this in. He looks over at Chase and then,
          after a beat, raises his hand.

          TOUR GUIDE (CONT'D)
          Yes?

                         GARRETT
          I love Chase Streeter-Rossi.
          All eyes turn to Garrett. Chase looks mortified.

                         TOUR GUIDE
          Okay then. Any other questions?

                         GARRETT
          (presses, turns to Chase)
          I love you, Chase. I've always loved
          you. And even though you pretty much
          stopped talking to me in fifth grade, I
          don't care. I remember the Chase that
          wrote me a card when my dad was
          overweight and had to go to the hospital
          because of his heart --

                         SASHA
          That was from the whole class.

                         GARRETT
          Shut up, Sasha, I'm talking about a
          different card.

                         (CONTINUING)
          And then, a year later, when he left my
          mom and moved in with his trainer, you
          wrote me another card. What happened to
          us? Remember when we had a sleepover in
          the second grade and you wet your bed and
          you were so embarrassed and you made me
          promise not to ever tell anyone. Well, I
          never did and I never will. I know we're
          really young, but remember Romeo and
          Juliet were only 13. A lot of people
          don't know that. So there it is. My
          heart on a sleeve.
          (goes into rhyming verse)
          Don't let me leave / Always believe /
          A beat. Chase stares at Garrett.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         CHASE
          Gross.
          Chase's friends all start laughing. The rest of the
          class joins in. Garrett runs down the steps, away from
          everyone.

                         SCOTT
          Alright, guys, let's settle down.
          The Tour Guide looks around, uncertain.

                         TOUR GUIDE

                         (POINTING)
          And these columns here are Doric columns.
          Now let's move inside to see the interior
          murals painted by Jules Guerin.
          The Tour Guide leads the group inside. Elizabeth looks
          back and sees Garrett on the steps, his head in his
          hands. She rolls her eyes and walks down to him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hey, Abe Lincoln, get up. Tour's not
          over.

                         GARRETT

                         (UPSET)
          She just laughed at me. Called me gross.

                         ELIZABETH
          You'll get over it. Get up.

                         GARRETT
          I'm not going back. Leave me alone!

                         ELIZABETH
          Now.

                         GARRETT
          No!
          Garrett runs off.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hey, come back here you little --
          Elizabeth starts running after him in heels. She
          immediately breaks a heel.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)

                         MOTHER --
          She breaks the other heel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Fucker.

          EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

           The students stand by their bus. Scott addresses them.

                         SCOTT
          Who had a good time in D.C.?
          The students let out a cheer.
          SCOTT (cont'd) (CONT'D)
          Who ate too many french fries at lunch?
          The students let out another cheer.
          SCOTT (cont'd) (CONT'D)
          Alright, let's do our final count-off.

                         STUDENT #1

          Wait, wait. Where's 5? Who's 5?
          Everyone looks around.

                         SASHA
          I think it's Garrett Tiara.

                         SCOTT
          Garrett! Garrett!
          Nothing. Scott looks around, stricken.

          Nothing.

          Elizabeth searches for Garrett.

                         ELIZABETH
          Garrett! Garrett!
          Her cell phone RINGS. She checks the caller ID: "HOT
          SCOTT." She puts the phone back in her purse.

          INT. LUXURY BUS - LATER

          The kids are getting restless. A lot of singing. A lot
          of horsing around.

                         (CHANTING)
          Let's go home! Let's go home!
          Scott sits up front by the driver. He's on his cell.

                         SCOTT

                         (FRANTIC )
          I'm freaking out here. They've been
          missing over two hours. I'm just a
          substitute!
          (then, to kids)
          Shut up!!!
          The chanting immediately stops.

                         INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. AMY'S APARTMENT - DAY

          Amy, the phone cradled to her ear, leans back on her
          couch. She's wearing splotches of calamine lotion over
          her rash and her hair is pulled back. A TURTLE plods
          across her kitchen table.

                         AMY

                         (WHEELS SPINNING)
          Oh my gosh. We just might have a Mary
          Kay Letourneau situation on our hands.
          Amy scratches the turtle's neck as it continues across
          the table.

                         SCOTT
          I don't know. You think?

                         AMY
          I know. The woman's a criminal
          mastermind.

                         SCOTT
          This is such a mess.

                         AMY
          What I need from you is to focus and get
          our kids home safe. I'll take care of
          everything here.

                         SCOTT
          Thanks, Amy. You're a lifesaver.

                         AMY
          It's what I do. Love you, Scooter.
          She hangs up the phone and cockily kicks her feet onto
          the table, accidentally knocking the turtle to the floor.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          Oh boy.

          EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT

          We're no longer in the tourist areas. A STRAY DOG walks
          down the middle of the street. SIRENS WAIL. PROSTITUTES
          hail Johns with catcalls. Elizabeth, still in her broken
          heels, walks down the gritty street. -

          She powers her phone off and continues down the street.
          She passes two PROSTITUTES.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Hey, guys. Hi. I'm looking for a young
          kid, about 13. Really annoying, kind of
          a cry baby. Have you seen him?

                         PROSTITUTE #1
          Fuck you.

                         ELIZABETH
          Fantastic.

                         PROSTITUTE #2
          You best step off, bitch, because this is
          my block. This here's Poetry's block.

                         ELIZABETH
          Poetry?

                         PROSTITUTE #1
          Cause that's how she fuck.

                         PROSTITUTE #2
          I fuck like that. Lyrical.
          Something occurs to Elizabeth. She smiles.

                         ELIZABETH
          Thank you, Poetry. And Poetry's friend.
          Elizabeth walks off and sticks out her hand, trying to
          hail a cab. She passes a bunch of HOMELESS MEN warming
          up by a trash can fire.

                         HOMELESS MAN #1
          Won't get a cab in this neighborhood.
          A CAR slows next to Elizabeth. A JOHN rolls down the
          passenger window and leans out.

                         JOHN
          Hey, sweetheart. How much for a titty
          fuck?

                         ELIZABETH
          I need a ride.

                         JOHN
          Oh yeah, I need a ride, too. Right
          through those titties.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         ELIZABETH
          No, I need a ride. Like you driving, and
          me pointing mace at your face. I'll give
          you ten bucks.

                         JOHN

                         (A BEAT)

          MIDNIGHT. PARENTS are waiting. A few console Garrett's
          mom, Melody. A few LOCAL NEWS VANS idle nearby.

                         (TO MELODY)
          He's gonna be alright. The police will
          find him. I'm sure they're back at the
          hotel. Probably just a mix-up.
          The bus pulls up to the curb and stops. Scott steps off
          first, clearly confused by the crowd and TV cameras.
          Immediately, a reporter thrusts a mic into his face.

                         REPORTER
          What can you. tell us about the alleged
          romance between Elizabeth Halsey and a 13
          year old student?

          The students step off and the Parents swarm them.

          Oh baby, are you okay? Did she touch
          you?
          Sasha's parents engulf her in a hug.

          Oh Sasha!
          (then, to Sasha's Dad)
          You expect this stuff to happen in

          Garrett walks up to a drab building where he sees
          Elizabeth on the curb waiting for him. There's a tiny
          sign that reads "Office of the Poet Laureate."

                         ELIZABETH
          It's closed. Won't be open till morning.
          Come on. Let's get back to the hotel.
          I'm sure everyone's mad at you.
          Garrett stands his ground.

                         GARRETT
          I'm not leaving without talking to the
          poet laureate.

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you think that some Shel Silverstein
          wannabe is going to tell you the meaning
          of life?

                         GARRETT
          What do you care?

                         ELIZABETH
          I'm here, right?

                         GARRETT
          You have to be here. You're a teacher.

                         ELIZABETH
          Not for long. I'm getting fired for
          cheating as soon as we get back.
          Garrett takes a seat next to Elizabeth.

                         GARRETT
          So. you came looking for me on your own?

                         ELIZABETH
          Yup.
          (holds up her shoes)
          And you owe me a new pair of
          Nanette Lepores.

                         GARRETT
          I just want to know what to say to Chase
          to get her to like me.

                         ELIZABETH
          You know what you should do?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          What?

                         ELIZABETH
          Just go out and sleep with as many girls,
          as you possibly can. Get her out of your
          head.

                         GARRETT
          They'll probably reject me, too.

                         ELIZABETH
          Yeah, probably. But life's about how you
          deal with rejection. You can either hide
          in a corner and cry or you can get
          stronger every time. And I figure a kid
          like you with not much going for him --
          if he were to choose the latter -- might
          end up becoming a pretty strong man.

                         GARRETT

                         (TOUCHED)
          Thanks.

                         ELIZABETH
          Now come on, let's get out of here. I'm
          freezing and Mr. Delacourte's probably
          shitting a brick.

                         GARRETT
          I can't go back there. All the kids will
          laugh at me.

                         ELIZABETH
          You seriously think they haven't been
          laughing already?

                         GARRETT
          Maybe Chase is wondering where I am.

                         ELIZABETH
          Hate to break it to you, kid, but I don't
          think anyone gives two shits where we are.

          INT. PRINCIPAL SNUR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

          Principal.Snur sits across from Garrett's mother, Melody,
          who is beside herself. She is wearing a beret. A
          DETECTIVE and Amy are standing behind the desk.
          Principal Snur passes her a dolphin-shaped tissue box.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         DETECTIVE
          What else can you tell us about Garrett
          and Ms. Halsey's relationship?

                         MELODY
          It was strictly student/teacher.
          Garrett's a gifted poet and Ms. Halsey
          was trying to bring that out of him.
          Amy snorts.

                         DETECTIVE
          Did they ever spend time outside of the
          classroom?

                         MELODY
          Aside from Christmas at our house?
          Absolutely not.
          The Detective glances at the Principal, like "Oh boy."

                         AMY
          She used to give all the guys that look.
          That sex look. You know --
          Amy gives her version of a sexy look to the Detective.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          She's a monster.

                         DETECTIVE
          Mrs. Tiara, I think we might need to
          consider the possibility that Elizabeth
          Halsey has abducted your son and that the
          two of them are involved in a sexual
          relationship.

                         MELODY

                         (INCONSOLABLE)
          Marbles doesn't even have armpit hair!

                         DETECTIVE
          (quietly, to Principal Snur)
          We should send out an Amber Alert. We
          need to catch this Sicko.

                         REPORTER
          A school official close to the scandal
          confirms that in addition to her alleged
          sexual relationship with the unnamed
          seventh grader, Elizabeth Halsey has been
          investigated for possible drug use,
          standardized testing fraud, and the theft
          of an "Annie" wig from a school
          production.
          The TV Report flashes an unflattering photo of ELIZABETH
          with a BLURRED OUT GARRETT.
          In front of the school, the Reporter turns to Principal Snur.

                         REPORTER (CONT'D)
          Can you comment on any of these allegations?

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          The superintendent will speak to the
          press shortly, but for now, I'd just like
          to say that I hope Ms. Halsey does the
          right thing and brings back our student.

          Elizabeth is reading "In Style" with the overhead light.
          Garrett stirs, rolls the other way and gently places his
          head on Elizabeth's shoulder. She looks at him and then
          shrugs her shoulder to get him off. His head falls back
          on. She leaves it.

                         GARRETT
          Hey, there's a bunch of people outside of
          my house.
          Elizabeth wakes up and looks up to see:
          A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL, including Amy, Scott, Melody, and
          many. of Garrett's classmates; a SEA OF TV CAMERAS; and

          TWO POLICE CARS.

          What the fuck?
          (then, to Garrett)
          Did you steal something?
          The taxi pulls up to the curb and Elizabeth and Garrett .exit.
          CHAOS. They're immediately swarmed by everyone. The
          Cops struggle to push past.

          The Cops get through and smother Garrett in a police
          blanket. A FEMALE COP roughly leads Elizabeth to one of

          You're quite the celebrity.

                         ELIZABETH
          You want an autograph?

                         SERGEANT
          You get one call.
          Elizabeth picks up the phone. The Sergeant gives her
          some space.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (INTO PHONE)

          Silence.
          Elizabeth and her roommate, Kirk, who's now dressed in an
          ill-fitting suit and has his hair combed, sit across from
          Principal Snur and the SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT, a no-
          nonsense woman in her 60s.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          Again, speaking on behalf of the whole
          administration, I just want to apologize
          for what happened. Clearly, there was a
          miscommunication.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, you think?
          Kirk puts his hand up to Elizabeth, like "I'll take care
          of this."

          And she has touched the lives of those

          Elizabeth pulls Kirk into a lawyer/client huddle.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (WHISPERS)
          You kind of sound like a pro.

                         KIRK

                         (WHISPERS)
          Do you think they're going to find out
          that I didn't pass the bar?

                         ELIZABETH

                         (WHISPERS)
          You're doing great.
          They break from their huddle.

                         KIRK
          Your administration jumped to
          conclusions, set off a media fire-storm
          and has humiliated one of its own. As
          Ms. .Halsey's chief counsel, I've advised
          her that we have an extremely strong case
          of libel and that it's certainly within
          her province to sue the district.

                         SUPERINTENDENT
          How do we make this go away?

                         KIRK
          Ms. Halsey is not a litigious woman. She
          wants this whole matter to go away as
          quickly and painlessly as possible.
          Kirk slides a piece of paper across the desk.

                         KIRK (CONT'D)
          This is a list of our demands.
          The Superintendent and Principal Snur scan the list.

          You're kidding me.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't answer right now. Let it marinate.
          Oh, and I should mention that if this
          goes to trial, I can cry on cue.
          Elizabeth starts crying. Everybody looks at her, aghast.
          And as quickly she started, she stops.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Now, if you'll all excuse me, I should be
          heading to fifth period. I hate to be
          tardy.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY

          Elizabeth heads down the empty hallway. From the auditorium,
          the faint sound of "Tomorrow, Tomorrow" from "Annie" can be
          heard.
          Amy steps out of the auditorium, humming along to the song.
          She notices Elizabeth coming to her. Amy debates her options.

                         AMY
          Elizabeth! I was so worried. You gave
          us quite a scare, you did.
          Elizabeth doesn't acknowledge her and continues walking
          toward Amy, only feet away now.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          (attempting some levity)
          Somebody's being a grumple--
          BAM! Elizabeth punches Amy square in the nose. Amy drops
          to her knees and grabs her nose, now squirting blood.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

          QUICK CUTS. It's class photo day. With each FLASH, we
          SEE a different TEACHER with a different CLASS.
          And finally AMY, with a bandage over her nose and two
          black eyes, smiles widely alongside her CLASS.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (V.0.)
          .Or the student/teacher spelling bee.

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY

          Much like the first scene of the movie. The teachers are
          sipping plastic flutes of Champagne. Principal Snur is
          up front. Elizabeth lingers in the back.

                         PRINCIPAL SNUR
          I think that was a huge s-u-c-c-a-s-s.
          Polite laughter.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          But seriously... With summer around the
          corner, it's time to not only say goodbye
          to another school year, but to also say
          goodbye to one of our own.
          Elizabeth smiles.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          Amy Squirrel.
          Amy, her face completely healed, steps forward, with a
          pursed smile.

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          After six short years of outstanding,
          tireless work here, Amy is transferring
          out of the district.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          PRINCIPAL SNUR (CONT'D)
          I know she'll bring her love for learning
          to her new students.
          Sandy, the ponytailed teacher, pipes up.

                         SANDY
          Speech! Speech!

                         AMY
          Although leaving was a difficult
          choice...
          Amy looks over to Elizabeth, who motions for her to
          continue.

                         AMY (CONT'D)
          When the superintendent personally asks
          you to work at one of the worst schools
          in the state, you say yes. I'm looking
          forward to bringing my brand of zany
          energy and lust -- not love, lust -- for
          learning to the underprivileged students
          at Malcolm X High. I welcome the
          challenge.
          The Teachers applaud, Scott the most enthusiastic.
          Elizabeth steps up to Amy, who flinches.

                         ELIZABETH
          Here, I got you this.
          Elizabeth hands Amy a poster tube. She.opens it and
          unravels the "Integrity" poster that Elizabeth stole.

                         ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          And good luck. Somebody's gonna need it.
          Elizabeth heads for the door. Scott catches up to her.

                         SCOTT
          Hey, Stranger.
          (then, whispers)
          Listen, now that Amy's transferring,
          maybe the two of us could go grab a
          drink.

                         ELIZABETH

                         SCOTT

                         

                         

                         

                         
          Elizabeth walks out.

                         CUT TO:

          CHYRON: THREE MONTHS LATER

          EXT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - TEACHER PARKING LOT - DAY

          Elizabeth's 1994 Grand-Am pulls into her spot. And as
           her bare leg steps out of the car, we

          INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

          The hallway is empty. We FOLLOW Elizabeth from behind,
          and as she reaches for the door to her class, we

          INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - DAY

          Quick cuts. From behind, we see Elizabeth place an APPLE
          on each desk, just as Amy did earlier.
          Elizabeth's walls are still bare, except for a framed
          photo of Amy's class picture, with Amy's messed up face,
          from the year before.
          The bell RINGS.
          Elizabeth turns and we now SEE that she has TASTEFUL FAKE

          BREASTS.
          Elizabeth walks to her door and opens it, watching the
          students as they reconnect with friends and share stories
          about summer camp.
          She notices Sasha who is MASSAGING a BOY's shoulders.
          bunch of other EIGHTH GRADE BOYS wait their turn.

          EIGHTH GRADE BOY
          Do me! Do me!
          Sasha clearly enjoys the attention. Elizabeth smiles.
          Garrett walks by, hand in hand with Chase. Trailing both
          of them are identical rolling backpacks. He sees
          Elizabeth and runs over.

                         ELIZABETH
          You and Chase, huh? She likes the
          poetry?

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         GARRETT
          She likes that I'm kind of a celebrity.
          But I'm cool with it. I'm the man around
          here!

                         ELIZABETH
          Easy.

                         GARRETT
          Well, I should get going. See you
          around, Ms. Halsey. Oh, and nice...
          He points at her breasts.

                         ELIZABETH

                         (TOUCHED)
          Thanks! You're the first student to
          notice.
          Garrett smiles and walks off. Lynn walks by. She's
          cleaning another big stain from her shirt.

                         LYNN
          Elizabeth, hey! How was your summer?

                         ELIZABETH
          It was great. I met a doctor! Plastic
          surgeon, actually. He's amazing.

                         LYNN
          He sounds amazing. How'd you meet him?
          The internet?

                         ELIZABETH
          No, in recovery. And I looked like ass,
          so I know it's real.

                         LYNN
          Sounds like a fairy tale.

                         ELIZABETH
          It is. Storybook. Well, not total
          storybook. It's a little messy because
          his wife filed for divorce last week, but
          we're gonna get through that.

                         (THEN)
          So you want to grab lunch later?

                         LYNN
          Sure! My treat.

                         ELIZABETH
          No, you got it last time. We'll split it.

                                            By

                                  Ethan Coen & Joel Coen


								FADE IN:

	ON BARTON FINK

	He is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat 
	bookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, 
	looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a 
	performance.

	In the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a 
	flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a 
	thick rope that hangs from the ceiling.

	The voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen 
	stage:

				ACTOR
		I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for 
		good.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, 
		these four stinkin' walls, the six 
		flights up, the el that roars by at 
		three A.M. like a castiron wind. 
		Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!  
		I'll miss 'em  like hell I will!

				ACTRESS
		Dreaming again!

				ACTOR
		Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now, 
		awake for the first time in years. 
		Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a 
		dream if you've lived with your eyes 
		closed. Well my eyes are open now! I 
		see that choir, and I know they're 
		dressed in rags! But we're part of 
		that choir, both of us  yeah, and 
		you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!

				MAURY
		The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be 
		hawking the fish down on Fulton 
		Street.

				ACTOR
		Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their 
		hearts out.

				MAURY
		That's it, kid. Take that ruined 
		choir.  Make it sing!

				ACTOR
		So long, Maury.

				MAURY
		So long.

	We hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A 
	tall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up 
	valise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:

				MAURY
		We'll hear from that kid. And I don't 
		mean a postcard.

	The actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int 
	he shadows behind Barton.

	An older man in work clothes  not wardrobe  passes in front 
	of Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of 
	the stage and cups his hands to his mouth.

				OLDER MAN
		FISH! FRESH FISH!

	As the man walks back off the screen:

				LILY
		Let's spit on our hands and get to 
		work.  It's late, Maury.

				MAURY
		Not any more Lil...

	Barton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:

				MAURY
		...It's early.

	With this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the 
	rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts 
	of "Bravo!"  

	As the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat 
	muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame 
	toward the stage.

	The stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain 
	back up and unmuting the applause.

	Barton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other 
	men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.

	BARTON'S POV

	Looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as 
	the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take 
	their bows and the cry of "Author, Author" goes up from the 
	crowd.

	The actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.

	BARTON

	He hesitates, unable to take it all in.

	He is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed 
	gentlemen.

	As he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.

	TRACKING SHOT

	Pushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he 
	leads the way through the restaurant.

				MAITRE 'D
		Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink...  
		several members of your party have 
		already arrived...

	REVERSE

	Pulling Barton

				FINK
		Is Garland Stanford here?

				MAITRE 'D
		He called to say he'd be a few minutes 
		late... Ah, here we are...

	TRACKING IN

	Toward a large semi-circular booth. Three guests, two me and 
	a woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton. A 
	fat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw 
	backstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in.

				MAN
		Barton, Barton, so glad you could 
		make it.  You know Richard St. 
		Claire...

	Barton nods and looks at the woman.

				MAN
		...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking 
		champagne, dear boy, in honor of the 
		occasion. Have you seen the Herald?

	Barton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man 
	fills it.

				BARTON
		Not yet.

				MAN
		Well, I don't want to embarrass you 
		but Caven could hardly contain 
		himself. But more important, Richard 
		and Poppy here loved the play.

				POPPY
		Loved it! What power!

				RICHARD
		Yeah, it was a corker.

				BARTON
		Thanks, Richard, but I know for a 
		fact the only fish you've ever seen 
		were tacked to a the wall of the 
		yacht club.

				RICHARD
		Ouch!

				MAN
		Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all 
		devastated.

				POPPY
		Weeping! Copius tears! What did the 
		Herald say?

				MAN
		I happen to have it with me.

				BARTON
		Please Derek 

				POPPY
		Do read it, do!

				DEREK
		"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the 
		Common Man. The star of the Bare 
		Ruined Choirs was not seen on the 
		stage of the Belasco last night  
		though the thespians involved all 
		acquitted themselves admirably. The 
		find of the evening was the author 
		of this drama about simple folk  
		fish mongers, in fact  whose brute 
		struggle for existence cannot quite 
		quell their longing for something 
		higher. The playwright finds nobility 
		in the most squalid corners and poetry 
		in the most callused speech. A tough 
		new voice in the American theater 
		has arrived, and the owner of that 
		voice is named... Barton Fink."

				BARTON
		They'll be wrapping fish in it in 
		the morning so I guess it's not a 
		total waste.

				POPPY
		Cynic!

				DEREK
		Well we can enjoy your success, 
		Barton, even if you can't.

				BARTON
		Don't get me wrong  I'm glad it'll 
		do well for you, Derek.

				DEREK
		Don't worry about me, dear boy  I 
		want you to celebrate.

				BARTON
		All right, but I can't start listening 
		to the critics, and I can't kid myself 
		about my own work. A writer writes 
		from his gut, and his gut tells him 
		what's good and what's... merely 
		adequate.

				POPPY
		Well I don't pretend to be a critic, 
		but Lord, I have a gut, and it tells 
		me it was simply marvelous.

				RICHARD
		And a charming gut it is.

				POPPY
		You dog!

				RICHARD
			(baying)
		Aaa-woooooooo!

	Barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling. 
	We swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the 
	restaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with 
	Barton's name on it.

	TRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR

	A distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes 
	is nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.

	PULLING BARTON

	As he draws near.

				BARTON
		I thought you were going to join us.  
		Jesus, Garland, you left me alone 
		with those people.

				GARLAND
		Don't panic, I'll join you in a 
		minute.  What's you think of Richard 
		and Poppy?

	Barton scowls

				BARTON
		The play was marvelous. She wept, 
		copiously. Millions of dollars and 
		no sense.

	Garland smiles, then draws Barton close.

				GARLAND
		We have to talk a little business. 
		I've just been on the phone to Los 
		Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures 
		wants to put you under contract. 
		They've offered you a thousand dollars 
		a week. I think I can get them to go 
		as high as two.

				BARTON
		To do what?

				GARLAND
		What do you do far a living?

				BARTON
		I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try 
		to make a difference.

				GARLAND
		Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, 
		because I respect you, but let me 
		point out a couple of things. One, 
		here you make a difference to five 
		hundred fifty people a night  if 
		the show sells out.  Eighty five 
		million people go to the pictures 
		every week.

				BARTON
		To see pap.

				GARLAND
		Yes, generally, to see pap. However, 
		point number two: A brief tenure in 
		Hollywood could support you through 
		the writing of any number of plays.

				BARTON
		I don't know, Garland; my place is 
		here right now. I feel I'm on the 
		brink of success-

				GARLAND
		I'd say you're already enjoying some.

	Barton leans earnestly forward.

				BARTON
		No, Garland, don't you see? Not the 
		kind of success where the critics 
		fawn over you or the producers like 
		Derek make a lot of money. No, a 
		real success  the success we've 
		been dreaming about  the creation 
		of a new, living theater of, about, 
		and for the common man! If I ran off 
		to Hollywood now I'd be making money, 
		going to parties, meeting the big 
		shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself 
		off from the wellspring of that 
		success, from the common man.

	He leans back and chuckles ruefully.

				BARTON
		...I guess I'm sprouting off again. 
		But I am certain of this, Garland: 
		I'm capable of more good work. Maybe 
		better work than I did in Choirs. It 
		just doesn't seem to me that Los 
		Angeles is the place to lead the 
		life of mind.

				GARLAND
		Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm 
		just the ten percenter. You decide 
		what you want and I'll make it happen. 
		I'm only asking that your decision 
		be informed by a little realism  if 
		I can use that word and Hollywood in 
		the same breath.

	Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the 
	floor.

	Garland studies him.

				GARLAND
		...Look, they love you, kid  
		everybody does. You see Caven's review 
		in the Herald?

				BARTON
		No, what did it say?

				GARLAND
		Take my copy. You're the toast of 
		Broadway and you have the opportunity 
		to redeem that for a little cash  
		strike that, a lot of cash.

	Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.

				GARLAND
		...The common man'll still be here 
		when you get back. What the hell, 
		they might even have one or two of 
		'em out in Hollywood.

	Absently:

				BARTON
		...That's a rationalization, Garland.

	Garland smiles gently.

				GARLAND
		Barton, it was a joke.

	We hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:

	A GREAT WAVE

	Crushing against the Pacific shore.

	The roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:

	HOTEL LOBBY

	A high wide shot from the front door, looking down across 
	wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty 
	wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.

	Amber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from 
	behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.  

	Barton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops 
	in the middle foreground to look across the lobby.

	We are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is 
	empty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.  

	Barton moves toward the front desk.

	THE REVERSE

	As Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver 
	bell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without 
	losing volume.

	After a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.  
	Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at 
	the floor behind the front desk.

	A TRAP DOOR

	It swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, 
	holding a shoebrush and a shoe  not one of his own  climbs 
	up from the basement.

	He closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his 
	finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting 
	it.

	The lobby is now silent again.

				CLERK
		Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I 
		help you, sir?

				BARTON
		I'm checking in. Barton Fink.

	The clerk flips through cards on the desk.

				CLERK
		F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be 
		you, huh?

				BARTON
		Must be.

				CLERK
		Okay then, everything seems to be in 
		order. Everything seems to be in 
		order.

	He is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.

				CLERK
		...Are you a tranz or a rez?

				BARTON
		Excuse me?

				CLERK
		Transient or resident?

				BARTON
		I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, 
		uh, indefinitely.

				CLERK
		Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a 
		week payable in advance. Checkout 
		time is twelve sharp, only you can 
		forget that on account you're a rez.  
		If you need anything, anything at 
		all, you dial zero on your personal 
		in-room telephone and talk to me. My 
		name is Chet.

				BARTON
		Well, I'm going to be working here, 
		mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do 
		you have room service?

				CLERK
		Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the 
		night clerk. I can always ring out 
		for sandwiches.

	The clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index 
	card.

				CLERK
		...Though we provide privacy for the 
		residential guest, we are also a 
		full service hotel including 
		complimentary shoe shine. My name is 
		Chet.

	He pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index 
	card.

	Barton looks at the card.

	On it: "CHET!" Barton looks back up at the clerk. They regard 
	each other for a beat.

				CLERK
		...Okay

				BARTON
		Huh?

	The clerk.

				CLERK
		Okey-dokey, go ahead.

				BARTON
		What 

				CLERK
		Don't you wanna go to your room?!

	Barton stares at him.

				BARTON
		...What number is it?

	The clerk stares back.

				CLERK
		...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell 
		you.

	As Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags:

				CLERK
		...Those your only bags?

				BARTON
		The others are being sent.

	The clerk leans over the desk to call after him:

				CLERK
		I'll keep an eye out for them. I'll 
		keep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.

	Barton is walking to the elevator.

	ELEVATOR

	Barton enters and sets down his bags.

	An aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon 
	uniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not 
	acknowledge Barton's presence.

	After a beat:

				BARTON
		...Six, please.

	The elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the 
	door closed:

				ELEVATOR MAN
		Next stop: Six.

	SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY

	Barton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the 
	doors.

	The long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained 
	forest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing 
	palm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door 
	midway down the hall.

	HIS ROOM

	As Barton enters.

	The room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy 
	bed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and 
	a wooden luggage stand.

	As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and 
	wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and 
	a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.  

	Barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, 
	jittering.  He shrugs off his jacket.

	Pips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.  

	He walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and 
	struggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it 
	for a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.  

	Barton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary 
	table. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.  

	Next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: 
	"THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME."

	We pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall 
	above the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a 
	cobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as 
	she looks out at a crashing surf.

	The sound of the surf mixes up.

	BARTON

	Looking at the picture

	TRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE

	The surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.

	The sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.

	THE HOUSE PHONE

	On the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings 
	Barton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.

				VOICE
		How d'ya like your room!

				BARTON
		...Who is this?

				VOICE
		Chet!

				BARTON
		...Who?

				VOICE
		Chet! From downstairs!

	Barton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose.

				VOICE
		...How d'ya like your room!

	A PILLOW

	As Barton's head drops down into frame against it.

	He reaches over and turns off the bedside light.

	He lies back and closes his eyes.

	A long beat.

	We hear a faint hum, growing louder.

	Barton opens his eyes.

	HIS POV

	A naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum  a mosquito, perhaps  
	stops.

	BARTON

	His eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he 
	shuts them again.

	After another silent beat, we hear  muffled, probably from 
	am adjacent room  a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and 
	weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob.

	Silence again.

	We hear the rising mosquito hum.

								FADE OUT

	EXECUTIVE OFFICE

	Barton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an 
	obsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit.

	There are mosquito bites on Barton's face.

	REVERSE

	From behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive 
	suit gets to his feet and strides across the room.

				MAN
		Is that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme 
		put my arms around this guy!

	He bear-hugs Barton.

				MAN
		...How the hell are ya? Good trip?

	He separates without waiting for an answer.

				MAN
		My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this 
		dump. You know that  you read the 
		papers.

	Lipnik is lumbering back to his desk.

				MAN
		Lou treating you all right? Got 
		everything you need?  What the hell's 
		the matter with your face? What the 
		hell's the matter with his face, 
		Lou?

				BARTON
		It's not as bad as it looks; just a 
		mosquito in my room 

				LIPNIK
		Place okay?

	To Lou:

				LIPNIK
		...Where did we put him?

				BARTON
		I'm at the Earle.

				LIPNIK
		Never heard of it. Let's move him to 
		the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, 
		he can stay at my place.

				BARTON
		Thanks, but I wanted a place that 
		was less...

				LIPNIK
		Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's 
		not a dirty word. Sat whatever the 
		hell you want. The writer is king 
		here at Capitol Pictures. You don't 
		believe me, take a look at your 
		paycheck at the end of every week  
		that's what we think of the writer.
			(to Lou)
		...so what kind of pictures does he 
		like?

				LOU
		Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, 
		Mr.  Lipnik.

				LIPNIK
		How's about it, Bart?

				BARTON
		To be honest, I don't go to the 
		pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 

				LIPNIK
		That's okay, that's okay, that's 
		okay  that's just fine. You probably 
		just walked in here thinking that 
		was going to be a handicap, thinking 
		we wanted people who knew something 
		about the medium, maybe even thinking 
		there was all kind of technical mumbo-
		jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. 
		We're only interested in one thing: 
		Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you 
		make us laugh, can you make us cry, 
		can you make us wanna break out in 
		joyous song? Is that more than one 
		thing? Okay.  The point is, I run 
		this dump and I don't know the 
		technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run 
		it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.  
		Showmanship. And also, and I hope 
		Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner 
		than any other kike in this town. 
		Did you tell him that, Lou? And I 
		don't mean my dick's bigger than 
		yours, it's not a sexual thing  
		although, you're the writer, you 
		would know more about that. Coffee?

				BARTON
		...Yes, thank you.

				LIPNIK
		Lou.

	Lou immediately rises and leaves. Lipnik's tone becomes 
	confidential:

				LIPNIK
		...He used to have shares in the 
		company.  An ownership interest. Got 
		bought out in the twenties  muscled 
		out according to some. Hell, according 
		to me. So we keep him around, he's 
		got a family. Poor schmuck. He's 
		sensitive, don't mention the old 
		days. Oh hell, say whatever you want.  
		Look, barring a preference, Bart, 
		we're gonna put you to work on a 
		wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I 
		say this because they tell me you 
		know the poetry of the street. That 
		would rule out westerns, pirate 
		pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...

	He rises and starts pacing.

				LIPNIK
		But look, I'm not one of these guys 
		thinks poetic has gotta be fruity.  
		We're together on that, aren't we? I 
		mean I'm from New York myself  well, 
		Minsk if you wanna go way back, which 
		we won't if you don't mind and I 
		ain't askin'. Now people're gonna 
		tell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, 
		it's a B picture. You tell them, 
		bullshit. We don't make B pictures 
		here at Capitol.  Let's put a stop 
		to that rumor right now.

	Lou enters with coffee.

				LIPNIK
		...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. 
		Talking about the Wallace Beery 
		picture.

				LOU
		Excellent picture.

				LIPNIK
		We got a treatment on it yet?

				LOU
		No, not yet Jack. We just bought the 
		story. Saturday Evening Post.

				LIPNIK
		Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace 
		Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know 
		his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, 
		he'll have to get mixed up with a 
		bad element. And a romantic interest. 
		You know the drill.  Romantic 
		interest, or else a young kid. An 
		orphan. What do you think, Lou?  
		Wally a little too old for a romantic 
		interest?  Look at me, a writer in 
		the room and I'm askin' Lou what the 
		goddamn story should be!

	After a robust laugh, he beams at Barton.

				LIPNIK
		...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? 
		Dame?

				BARTON
		...Both maybe?

	There is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou.  Lou 
	clears his throat.

				LOU
		...Maybe we should do a treatment.

				LIPNIK
		Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at 
		it.  He'll get into the swing of 
		things or I don't know writers. Let's 
		make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. 
		We don't gotta tackle the world our 
		first time out. The important thing 
		is we all have that Barton Fink 
		feeling, but since you're Barton 
		Fink I'm assuming you have it in 
		spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. 
		We're off to a good start. Dammit, 
		if all our writers were like you I 
		wouldn't have to get so goddamn 
		involved. I'd like to see something 
		by the end of the week.

	Lou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do 
	likewise.

				LIPNIK
		...Heard about your show, by the 
		way. My man in New York saw it. Tells 
		me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty 
		damn moving.  A little fruity, he 
		said, but I guess you know what you're 
		doing. Thank you for your heart. We 
		need more heart in pictures.  We're 
		all expecting great things.

	TRACKING SHOT

	We are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night. 
	A pair of shoes sits before each door. Faintly, from one of 
	the rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a 
	typewriter.

	It grows louder as we track forward.

	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  TYPEWRITER

	Close on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is 
	typed, without context.

	One by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e. After a short 
	beat, a period strikes.

	BARTON

	Elbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written. 
	He rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.

	THE PAGE

	It says:

								FADE IN:

	A TENEMENT BUILDING

	On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
	audible.

	BARTON

	After a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.

	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT

	The letter-strike area. It is lined up to the last period, 
	which is struck over by a comma. The words "as is" are typed 
	in and we cut back to 

	BARTON

	 as he continues typing. He stops after several more 
	characters and looks.

	Silence.

	Breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. 
	A man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.

	Barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.

	HIS POV

	The picture of the girl on the beach.

	BARTON

	Staring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton 
	looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but 
	the sound is too insistent to ignore.

	WIDE SHOT

	The room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.  

	The laughter.

	Barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and 
	looks out.

	HIS POV

	The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the 
	end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the 
	staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of 
	wall sconces.

	The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the 
	empty hall.

	Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because 
	it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for 
	weeping.

	Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly 
	withdraws into his room.

	HIS ROOM

	Barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The 
	laughter/weeping continues.

	He walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house 
	phone.

				BARTON
		Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink 
		in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's 
		someone in the room next door to 
		mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... 
		making a lot of... noise.

	After a beat:

				BARTON
		...Thank you.

	He cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or 
	two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the 
	telephone ringing next door.

	Barton looks at the wall.

	The muffled sound of a man talking.

	The sound of the earpiece being pronged.

	Muffled footsteps next door.

	The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.  

	Footsteps approaching the hall.

	A hard, present knock at Barton's door.

	Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.

	ON THE DOOR

	As Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man  a 
	very large man  in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened 
	tie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of 
	sweat.

				MAN
		Did you... Somebody just complained...

	Hastily:

				BARTON
		No, I didn't  I mean, I did call 
		down, not to complain exactly, I was 
		just concerned that you might  not 
		that it's my business, but that you 
		might be in some kind of... distress. 
		You see, I was trying to work, and 
		it's, well, it was difficult 

				MAN
		Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered 
		you.  The damn walls here, well, I 
		just apologize like hell...

	He sticks his hand out.

				MAN
		...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess 
		we're neighbors...

	Without reaching for the hand.

				BARTON
		Barton Fink.

	Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.

				CHARLIE
		Neighbor, I'd feel better about the 
		damned inconvenience if you'd let me 
		buy you a drink.

				BARTON
		That's all right, really, thank you.

				CHARLIE
		All right, hell, you trying to work 
		and me carrying on in there. Look, 
		the liquor's good, wuddya say?

	As he enters:

				CHARLIE
		... You got a glass? It's the least 
		I can do.

				BARTON
		Okay... a quick one, sure...

	He gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down 
	on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, 
		all the carryings-on next door.

				BARTON
		That's okay, I assure you. It's just 
		that I was trying to work 

				CHARLIE
		What kind of work do you do, Barton, 
		if you don't mind my asking?

				BARTON
		Well, I'm a writer, actually.

				CHARLIE
		You don't say. That's a tough racket. 
		My hat's off to anyone who can make 
		a go of it. Damned interesting work, 
		I'd imagine.

				BARTON
		Can be. Not easy, but 

				CHARLIE
		Damned difficult, I'd imagine.

	As he hands Charlie a glass:

				BARTON
		And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

				CHARLIE
		Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, 
		you might say I sell peace of mind. 
		Insurance is my game  door-to-door, 
		human contact, still the only way to 
		move merchandise.

	He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty 
	glass.

				CHARLIE
		...In spite of what you might think 
		from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.

				BARTON
		Doesn't surprise me at all.

				CHARLIE
		Hell yes. Because I believe in it. 
		Fire, theft, and casualty are not 
		things that only happen to other 
		people  that's what I tell 'em. 
		Writing doesn't work out, you might 
		want to look into it. Providing for 
		basic human need  a fella could do 
		worse.

				BARTON
		Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.

				CHARLIE
		What kind of scribbler are you  
		newspaperman did you say?

				BARTON
		No, I'm actually writing for the 
		pictures now 

				CHARLIE
		Pictures! Jesus!

	He guffaws.

				CHARLIE
		...I'm sorry, brother, I was just 
		sitting here thinking I was talking 
		to some ambitious youngster, eager 
		to make good.  Hell, you've got it 
		made! Writing for pictures! Beating 
		out that competition!  And me being 
		patronizing!

	He gestures toward his face:

				CHARLIE
		...Is the egg showing or what?!

				BARTON
		That's okay; actually I am just 
		starting out in the movies  though 
		I was pretty well established in New 
		York, some renown there,

				CHARLIE
		Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm 
		not the best-read mug on the planet, 
		so I guess it's no surprise I didn't 
		recognize your name. Jesus, I feel 
		like a heel.

	For the first time Barton smiles.

				BARTON
		That's okay, Charlie. I'm a 
		playwright. My shows've only played 
		New York. Last one got a hell of a 
		write-up in the Herald. I guess that's 
		why they wanted me here.

				CHARLIE
		Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.  
		What kind of venue, that is to say, 
		thematically, uh...

				BARTON
		What do I write about?

	Charlie laughs.

				CHARLIE
		Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, 
		that's it, Bart.

				BARTON
		Well, that's a good question. Strange 
		as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I 
		write about people like you. The 
		average working stiff. The common 
		man.

				CHARLIE
		Well ain't that a kick in the head!

				BARTON
		Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, 
		that's exactly the point. There's a 
		few people in New York  hopefully 
		our numbers are growing  who feel 
		we have an opportunity now to forge 
		something real out of everyday 
		experience, create a theater for the 
		masses that's based on a few simple 
		truths  not on some shopworn 
		abstractions about drama that doesn't 
		hold true today, if they ever did...

	He gazes at Charlie.

				BARTON
		...I don't guess this means much to 
		you.

				CHARLIE
		Hell, I could tell you some stories

				BARTON
		And that's the point, that we all 
		have stories. The hopes and dreams 
		of the common man are as noble as 
		those of any king. It's the stuff of 
		life  why shouldn't it be the stuff 
		of theater?  Goddamnit, why should 
		that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't 
		call it new theater, Charlie; call 
		it real theater. Call it our theater.

				CHARLIE
		I can see you feel pretty strongly 
		about it.

				BARTON
		Well, I don't mean to get up on my 
		high horse, but why shouldn't we 
		look at ourselves up there?  Who 
		cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop 
		and Lady Higginbottom and  and  
		and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

				CHARLIE
		I can feel my butt getting sore 
		already.

				BARTON
		Exactly, Charlie! You understand 
		what I'm saying  a lot more than 
		some of these literary types. Because 
		you're a real man!

				CHARLIE
		And I could tell you some stories 

				BARTON
		Sure you could!  And yet many writers 
		do everything in their power to 
		insulate themselves from the common 
		man  from where they live, from 
		where they trade, from where they 
		fight and love and converse and  
		and  and... so naturally their work 
		suffers, and regresses into empty 
		formalism and  well, I'm spouting 
		off again, but to put it in your 
		language, the theater becomes as 
		phony as a three dollar bill.

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right 
		there.

				BARTON
		Frequently played, seldom remarked.

	Charlie laughs.

				CHARLIE
		Whatever that means.

	Barton smiles with him.

				BARTON
		You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad 
		you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well 
		I know I sometimes run on.

				CHARLIE
		Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, 
		I'll let you know if I'm bored. I 
		find it all pretty damned interesting. 
		I'm the kind schmoe who's generally 
		interested in the other guy's point 
		of view.

				BARTON
		Well, we've got something in common 
		then.

	Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.

				CHARLIE
		Well Christ, if there's any way I 
		can contribute, or help, or whatever

	Barton chuckles and extends his hand.

				BARTON
		Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by 
		just being yourself.

				CHARLIE
		Well, I can tell you some stories 

	He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.

				CHARLIE
		...And look, I'm sorry as hell about 
		the interruption. Too much revelry 
		late at night, you forget there are 
		other people in the world.

				BARTON
		See you, Charlie.

	Charlie closes the door and is gone.

	Barton goes back to his desk and sits.

	Muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening 
	and closing.

	Barton looks at the wall.

	HIS POV

	The bathing beauty.

	From offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound.

				BARTON
		He looks around to the opposite  
		bed  wall.

	HIS POV

	The wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat.  

	One swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from 
	the wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the 
	ceiling, is exposed.

	The strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and 
	nods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical 
	flower.

	BACK TO BARTON

	He goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the 
	wallpaper back up against the wall.

	He looks at his hand.

	HIS HAND

	Sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat.

	He wipes it onto his shirt.

	We hear a faint mosquito hum.

	Barton looks around.

								FADE OUT

	A TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too 
	quickly for us to make out the words.

	SLOW TRACK IN

	On Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring 
	blankly.  Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and 
	bloodshot.

	HIS POV

	A gargoyle secretary sits typing a document.

	The office door opens in the background and a short middle-
	aged man in a dark suit emerges.

	To his secretary:

				EXECUTIVE
		I'm eating on the lot today 

	He notices Barton.

				EXECUTIVE
		...Who's he?

	The secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip 
	of paper on her desk.

				SECRETARY
		Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.

				GEISLER
		More please.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum 
		said I should drop by morning to see 
		you about the 

				GEISLER
		Ever act?

				BARTON
		...Huh? No, I'm 

				GEISLER
		We need Indians for a Norman Steele 
		western.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer. Ted O 

				GEISLER
		Think about it, Fink. Writers come 
		and go; we always need Indians.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're 
		producing this Wallace Beery picture 
		I'm working on.

				GEISLER
		What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. 
		They've assigned me enough pictures 
		for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum 
		doesn't know you could almost squeeze 
		into the Hollywood Bowl.

				BARTON
		Then who should I talk to?

	Geisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he 
	addresses the secretary:

				GEISLER
		Get me Lou Breeze.

	He perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward 
	the secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton.

	After a moment:

				SECRETARY
		Is he in for Mr. Geisler?

	She puts the phone in Geisler's hand.

				GEISLER
		Lou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this 
		morning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay, 
		the reason I'm calling, I got a writer 
		here, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm 
		producing that Wallace Beery wrestling 
		picture  what'm I, the goddamn 
		janitor around here?...  Yeah, well 
		who'd you get that from?...  Yeah, 
		well tell Lipnik he can kiss my 
		dimpled ass... Shit! No, alright... 
		No, no, all right.

	Without looking he reaches the phone back. The secretary 
	takes it and cradles it.

				GEISLER
		...Okay kid, let's chow.

	COMMISSARY

	Barton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. Geisler 
	speaks through a mouthful of food:

				GEISLER
		Don't worry about it. It's just a B 
		picture. I bring it in on budget, 
		they'll book it without even screening 
		it. Life is too short.

				BARTON
		But Lipnik said he wanted to look at 
		the script, see something by the end 
		of the week.

				GEISLER
		Sure he did. And he forgot about it 
		before your ass left his sofa.

				BARTON
		Okay. I'm just having trouble getting 
		started. It's funny, I'm blocked up.  
		I feel like I need some kind of 
		indication of... what's expected 

				GEISLER
		Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. 
		What do you need, a road map?

	Geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton.

				GEISLER
		...Look, you're confused? You need 
		guidance? Talk to another writer.

				BARTON
		Who?

	Geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.

				GEISLER
		Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll 
		hit one. And do me a favor, Fink: 
		Throw it hard.

	COMMISSARY MEN'S ROOM

	Barton stands at a urinal.

	He stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. After a 
	moment, he cocks his head, listening.

	We hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a 
	difficult passage. It is followed by the gurgling ruch of 
	vomit.

	Barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls.

	There is more businesslike throat clearing.

	Barton stoops.

	HIS POV

	We boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished 
	shoes of the stall's kneeling occupant.

	A white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect 
	the trouser knees.

	The toilet flushes. The man rises, picks up his handkerchief 
	up off the floor and gives it a smart flap.

	BARTON

	He quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts washing 
	his hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched.

	Barton glances over his shoulder.

	HIS POV

	The stall door opening.

	BARTON

	Quickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands.

	HIS POV

	His hands writhing under the running water. We hear footsteps 
	approaching.

	BARTON

	Forcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man reach 
	the adjacent sink and turn on the tap.

	Barton can't help glancing up.

	THE MAN

	A dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. He has warm 
	brown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache. 
	He smiles pleasantly at Barton.

	BARTON

	He gives a nervous smile  more like a tic  and looks back 
	down at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spitting 
	into the sink.

	After a moment, Barton looks up again.

	THE MAN

	Reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, 
	a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.

	BARTON

	Looks back down, then up again.

	THE MAN

	Extends a dripping hand.

				MAN
		Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.

	His speech is softly accented, from the South.

				BARTON
		Barton Fink.

	They shake, then return to their ablutions.

	We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned 
	off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's 
	eyes are widening.

				BARTON
		...Jesus. W.P.!

	The dapper little man stops and turns.

				MAYHEW
		I beg your pardon?

				BARTON
		W.P. Mayhew? The writer?

				MAYHEW
		Just Bill, please.

	Barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little 
	man, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short 
	pause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but 
	urgent.

				BARTON
		Bill!...

	Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally 
	Barton brings out:

				BARTON
		...You're the finest novelist of our 
		time.

	Mayhew leans against a stall.

				MAYHEW
		Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein' 
		occupied here in the worship of 
		Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet 
		to see your play 

	He smiles at Barton's surprise.

				MAYHEW
		...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the 
		news reaches us in Hollywood.

	He is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.

				BARTON
		Sir, I'm flattered that you even 
		recognize my name. My God, I had no 
		idea you were in Hollywood.

				MAYHEW
		All of us undomesticated writers 
		eventually make their way out here 
		to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's 
		why I allus have such a powerful 
		thrust.

	He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves 
	it at Barton.

				MAYHEW
		...A little social lubricant, Mistuh 
		Fink?

				BARTON
		It's still a little early for me.

				MAYHEW
		So be it.

	He knocks back some more.

				BARTON
		...Bill, if I'm imposing you should 
		say so, I know you're very busy  I 
		just, uh... I just wonder if I could 
		ask you a favor... That is to say, 
		uh... have you ever written a 
		wrestling picture?

	Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.

				MAYHEW
		...You are drippin', suh.

	Barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown 
	paper towel from a dispenser.

	Mayhew sighs:

				MAYHEW
		...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented 
		a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew 
		has not, at one time or othuh, been 
		invited to essay. I have taken my 
		stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I 
		have stabbed at so many others, and 
		with as little success. I gather 
		that you are a fresh-man here, eager 
		for an upperclassman's council.  
		However, just at the moment...

	He waves his flask.

				MAYHEW
		...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't 
		you stop at my bungalow, which is 
		numbah fifteen, later on this 
		afternoon...

	He turns to leave.

				MAYHEW
		...and we will discuss wrastlin' 
		scenarios and other things lit'rary.

	THE NUMBER "15"

	We are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door.  

	Muted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice  enraged, 
	bellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's 
	voice, its tone placating.

	REVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN

	On Barton, standing in front of the door.

	The noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice 
	again.

	Barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks.  

	With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing 
	again.

	The door cracks open.

	The woman looks as if she has been crying.

				WOMAN
		...Can I help you?

				BARTON
		I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... 
		Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this 
		afternoon.  Is he in?

				WOMAN
		Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the 
		moment

	From inside, we hear Mayhew's wail.

				MAYHEW
		HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

	The woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps 
	outside, closing the door behind her.

				WOMAN
		Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. 
		Mayhew's personal secretary. I know 
		this all must sound horrid. I really 
		do apologize...

	Through the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously.

				BARTON
		Is, uh... Is he okay?

				AUDREY
		He will be... When he can't write, 
		he drinks.

				MAYHEW
		WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S 
		M'HONEY!!

	She brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.

				AUDREY
		I am sorry, it's so embarassing.

				BARTON
		How about you? Will you be alright?

				AUDREY
		I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr 
		Fink?

				BARTON
		Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  
		please call me Barton.

	Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.

				AUDREY
		I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm 
		sure he'll want to reschedule your 
		appointment.

				BARTON
		Perhaps you and I could get together 
		at some point also. I'm sorry if 
		that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't 
		know anyone here in this town.

	Audrey smiles at him.

				AUDREY
		Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

				BARTON
		Please, Barton.

				AUDREY
		Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not 
		just Bill's secretary  Bill and I 
		are... I love. We-

				MAYHEW'S VOICE
		M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

	Audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes 
	and heavy footsteps.

				BARTON
		I see.

				AUDREY
		...I know this must look... funny.

				BARTON
		No, no 

	Hurriedly:

				AUDREY
		We need each other. We give each 
		other...  the things we need 

				VOICE
		M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of 
		bitches... the water's lappin' up...
		M'HONEY!!

				AUDREY
		I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't 
		judge us. Please...

	Flustered, she backs away and closes the door.

	CLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE

	Hand-printed on the package is the message:

	"Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink.  Chet!"  

	The wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened.

	Two thumbtacks are taken out.

	BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM

	Late at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has 
	sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the 
	swath next to it.

	Barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed.

	He smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near 
	the top.

	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT

	On the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky 
	yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around 
	the tack.

	ON BARTON

	Smoothing up the second swath.

	As he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening.  

	Muffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning.  

	After a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the 
	wall.

	CLOSE ON BARTON

	As his ear meets the wall.

	The woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of 
	bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling.

	Barton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the 
	secretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the 
	carriage.

	HIS POV

	The blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under 
	the metal prongs that hold the paper down.

	We begin to hear moaning again.

	BACK TO BARTON

	Still looking; sweating.

	HIS POV

	Tracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so 
	that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the 
	page.

	The moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks.

	THE DOOR

	As it swings open.  Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling.

				CHARLIE
		Howdy, neighbor.

				BARTON
		Charlie. How are you.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting 
		you again. I heard you walking around 
		in here.  Figured I'd drop by.

				BARTON
		Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really 
		gotten started yet  what happened 
		to your ear?

	 for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As 
	he enters:

				CHARLIE
		Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic 
		thing.  Goes away for a while, but 
		it always comes back. Gotta put cotton 
		in it to staunch the flow of pus. 
		Don't worry, it's not contagious.

				BARTON
		Seen a doctor?

	Charlie gives a dismissive wave.

				CHARLIE
		Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell 
		me?  Can't trade my head in for a 
		new one.

				BARTON
		No, I guess you're stuck with the 
		one you've got. Have a seat.

	Charlie perches on the corner of the bed.

				CHARLIE
		Thanks, I'd invite you over to my 
		place, but it's a goddamn mess. You 
		married, Bart?

				BARTON
		Nope.

				CHARLIE
		I myself have yet to be lassoed.

	He takes his flask out.

				CHARLIE
		...Got a sweetheart?

				BARTON
		No... I guess it's something about 
		my work. I get so worked up over it, 
		I don't know; I don't really have a 
		lot of attention left over, so it 
		would be a little unfair...

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. 
		In my experience, they pretend to 
		give it, but it's generally a smoke-
		screen for demanding it back  with 
		interest. How about family, Bart?  
		How're you fixed in that department?

	Barton smiles.

				BARTON
		My folks live in Brooklyn, with my 
		uncle.

				CHARLIE
		Mine have passed on. It's just the 
		three of us now...

	He taps himself on the head, chuckling.

				CHARLIE
		...What's the expression  me myself 
		and I.

				BARTON
		Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, 
		we're all alone in this world aren't 
		we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by 
		family and friends, but...

	He shrugs.

				CHARLIE
		Mm... You're no stranger to 
		loneliness, then. I guess I got no 
		beef; especially where the dames are 
		concerned. In my line of work I get 
		opportunities galore  always on the 
		wing, you know what I'm saying. I 
		could tell stories to curl your hair 
		 but it looks like you've already 
		heard 'em!

	He laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls 
	a dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to 
	Barton:

				CHARLIE
		...That's me in Kansas City, plying 
		my trade.

	THE PHOTO

	Charlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running 
	board of a 1939 roadster. A battered leather briefcase dangles 
	from one hand.

				CHARLIE
		...It was taken by one of my policy 
		holders. They're more than just 
		customers to me, Barton.  They really 
		appreciate what I have to offer them. 
		Ya see, her hubby was out of town at 
		the time 

				BARTON
		You know, in a way, I envy you 
		Charlie.  Your daily routine  you 
		know what's expected. You know the 
		drill. My job is to plumb the depths, 
		so to speak, dredge something up 
		from inside, something honest. There's 
		no road map for that territory...

	He looks from Charlie to the Underwood.

				BARTON
		...and exploring it can be painful. 
		The kind of pain most people don't 
		know anything about.

	He looks back at Charlie.

				BARTON
		...This must be boring you.

				CHARLIE
		Not at all. It's damned interesting.

				BARTON
		Yeah...

	He gives a sad chuckle.

				BARTON
		...Probably sounds a little grand 
		coming from someone who's writing a 
		wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

				CHARLIE
		Beery! You got no beef there! He's 
		good.  Hell of an actor  though, 
		for my money, you can't beat Jack 
		Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, 
		funny stuff. But don't get me wrong 
		 Beery, a wrestling picture, that 
		could be a pip. Wrestled some myself 
		back in school. I guess you know the 
		basic moves.

				BARTON
		Nope, never watched any. I'm not 
		that interested in the act itself 

				CHARLIE
		Okay, but hell, you should know what 
		it is. I can show you in about thirty 
		seconds.

	He is getting down on his hands and knees.

				CHARLIE
		...You're a little out of your weight 
		class, but just for purposes of 
		demonstration 

				BARTON
		That's all right, really 

				CHARLIE
		Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest 
		thing in the world! You just get 
		down on your knees to my left, slap 
		your right hand here...

	He indicated his own right bicep.

				CHARLIE
		...and your left hand here.

	He indicated his left bicep.

	Barton hesitates.

				CHARLIE
		...You can do it, champ!

	Barton complies.

				CHARLIE
		...All right now, when I say "Ready...  
		wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I 
		try and pin you. That's the whole 
		game. Got it?

				BARTON
		...Yeah, okay.

				CHARLIE
		Ready... wrestle!

	With one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his 
	head and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Barton's 
	shoulders with his own upper body.

	But before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing 
	again, offering his hand down to Barton.

				CHARLIE
		Damn, there I go again. We're gonna 
		wake the downstairs neighbors.  I 
		didn't hurt ya, did I?

	Barton seems dazed, but not put out.

				BARTON
		It's okay, it's okay.

				CHARLIE
		Well, that's all that wrestling is. 
		Except usually there's more grunting 
		and squirming before the pin. Well, 
		it's your first time. And you're out 
		of your weight class.

	Barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the 
	back of his head. This registers on Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus, I did hurt you!

	He clomps hurriedly away.

				CHARLIE
		...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I 
		sure do apologize.

	We hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel.  

	Barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.

				CHARLIE
		...You sure you're okay?

	Barton gets to his feet.

				BARTON
		I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. 
		Actually, it's been helpful, but I 
		guess I should get back to work.

	Charlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads 
	for the door.

				CHARLIE
		Well, it wasn't fair of me to do 
		that. I'm pretty well endowed 
		physically.

	He opens the door.

				CHARLIE
		...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't 
		be much of a match for you at mental 
		gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you 
		need anything.

	The door closes.

	Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the 
	back of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at the 
	page in the typewriter.

	HIS POV

	The page.

								FADE IN:

	A TENEMENT BUILDING

	On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
	audible, as is the cry fishmongers.

	BACK TO BARTON

	He rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the 
	page.

	His gaze drifts up.

	HIS POV

	The bathing beauty.

	BARTON

	Looking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands 
	against his ears.

	HIS POV

	The bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the 
	surf.

	BARTON

	Head cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound.  
	Barton looks sharply around.

	THE BATHROOM

	Barton enters.

	The sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet 
	Barton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile 
	floor.

	Barton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and 
	reaches into the sink.

	As his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged 
	sink gulp water.

	BARTON'S HAND

	Holding a dripping wad of cotton.

	BARTON

	After a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton 
	came from  and convulsively flips it away.

								FADE OUT

								FADE IN:

	ON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK:

	"NEBUCHADNEZZAR  
	BY  
	W.P. Mayhew"

	A hand enters with pen to inscribe: "To Barton 

	May this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn 
	among the Philistines.   Bill"

	The book is closed and picked up.

	WIDER

	As-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table, 
	in front of Barton, by Mayhew.

	Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table. 
	It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco 
	open-air hamburger stand.

	It is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight slopes 
	down through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the 
	only customers at the stand.

	Mayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot.  

	Mayhew leans back in his chair.

				MAYHEW
		If I close m'eyes I can almost smell 
		the live oak.

				AUDREY
		That's hamburger grease, Bill.

				MAYHEW
		Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish 
		on me  lyin' and deceitful...

	His eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the 
	breeze.

				MAYHEW
		...Still, I must say. I haven't felt 
		peace like this since the grand 
		productive days. Don't you find it 
		so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

				BARTON
		Well... actually, no Bill...

	Barton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.

				BARTON
		...No, I've always found that writing 
		comes from a great inner pain. Maybe 
		it's a pain that comes from a 
		realization that one must do something 
		for one's fellow man  to help somehow 
		to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a 
		personal pain. At any rate, I don't 
		believe good work is possible without 
		it.

				MAYHEW
		Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' 
		things up. Yessir. Escape... It's 
		when I can't write, can't escape 
		m'self, that I want to tear m'head 
		off and run screamin' down the street 
		with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. 
		Mm...

	He sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey.

				MAYHEW
		...This'll sometimes help.

				AUDREY
		That doesn't help anything, Bill.

				BARTON
		That's true, Bill. I've never found 
		it to help my writing.

	Mayhew is becoming testy:

				MAYHEW
		Your writing? Son, have you ever 
		heard the story of Soloman's mammy-

	Audrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. She taps the book on 
	the table.

				AUDREY
		You should read this, Barton. I think 
		it's Bill's finest, or among his 
		finest anyway.

	Mayhew looks at her narrowly.

				MAYHEW
		So now I'm s'posed to roll over like 
		an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly 
		scratched.

				AUDREY
		Bill 

				BARTON
		Look, maybe it's none of my business, 
		but a man with your talent  don't 
		you think your first obligation would 
		be to your gift? Shouldn't you be 
		doing whatever you have to do to 
		work again?

				MAYHEW
		And what would that be, son?

				BARTON
		I don't know exactly. But I do know 
		what you're doing with that drink. 
		You're cutting yourself off from 
		your gift, and from me and Audrey, 
		and from your fellow man, and from 
		everything your art is about.

				MAYHEW
		No son, thisahere moonshine's got 
		nothin' to do with shuttin' folks 
		out. No, I'm usin' it to build 
		somethin'.

				BARTON
		What's that?

				MAYHEW
		I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, 
		brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee 
		to keep that ragin' river of manure 
		from lappin' at m'door.

				AUDREY
		Maybe you better too, Barton. Before 
		you get buried under his manure.

	Mayhew chuckles.

				MAYHEW
		M'honey pretends to be impatient 
		with me, Barton, but she'll put up 
		with anything.

				AUDREY
		Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

				BARTON
		You're lucky she puts up with as 
		much as she does.

	Mayhew is getting to his feet.

				MAYHEW
		Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. 
		People who know about the human heart, 
		though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over 
		here, he gives his honey love, and 
		she pays him back with pity  the 
		basest coin there is.

				AUDREY
		Stop it, Bill!

	He wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, 
	still clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey, 
	and urinates into the grass.

	He is singing  loudly  "Old Black Joe."

	Audrey walks over to him.

	BARTON

	Watching her go.

	HIS POV

	Audrey touches Mayhew's elbow. He looks at her, stops singing, 
	she murmurs something, and he bellows:

				MAYHEW
		The truth, m'honey, is a tart that 
		does not bear scrutiny.

	She touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, 
	knocking her to the ground.

				MAYHEW
		Breach my levee at your peril!

	BARTON

	He rises.

	AUDREY

	Coming back to Barton.

	MAYHEW

	Stumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and 
	waving his bottle of Wild Turkey.

				AUDREY
		Let him go.

				BARTON
		That son of a bitch... Don't get me 
		wrong, he's a fine writer.

	He looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving 
	in the dust.

				MAYHEW
		I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, 
		and from there I'll... improvise.

				BARTON
		Are you all right?

	We hear distant bellowing:

				MAYHEW
		Silent upon a hill in Darien!

	Audrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her 
	and she leans into him.

				BARTON
		Audrey, you can't put up with this.

	Gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.

				AUDREY
		...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for 
		him!

				BARTON
		What?! He's a son of a bitch!

				AUDREY
		No, sometimes he just... well, he 
		thinks about Estelle. His wife still 
		lives in Fayettesville. She's... 
		disturbed.

				BARTON
		Really?...

	He considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.

				BARTON
		...Well that doesn't excuse his 
		behavior.

				AUDREY
		He'll wander back when he's sober 
		and apologize. He always does.

				BARTON
		Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 

				AUDREY
		Barton. Empathy requires... 
		understanding.

				BARTON
		What. What don't I understand?

	Audrey gazes at him.

	MAYHEW

	He is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his 
	light summer suit. "Old Black Joe" floats back to us in the 
	twilight.

								FADE OUT

	BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM

	From a high angle, booming down on Barton.

	The room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out 
	on the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the 
	stillness.

	Suddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains 
	still. The hum fades up again.  Barton reaches over and turns 
	on the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he 
	waits, listening.

	The hum fades down to silence.

	Barton's eyes shift.

	HIS POV

	The typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled 
	halfway through the carriage.

	THE TYPEWRITER

	Barton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter.

	HIS POV

	Next to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper.  
	The page in the carriage reads:

								FADE IN:

	A TENEMENT HOTEL

	On the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the 
	fishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, 
	perhaps, we will.

	BACK TO BARTON

	Looking down at the page.

	CLOSE ON BARTON'S FEET

	Swinging in the legwell.

	One foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined 
	shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the 
	legwell.

	We hear typing start.

	THE PAGE

	A new paragraph being started: "A large man..."

	BARTON'S FEET

	As he slides them into the shoes.

	THE PAGE

	"A large man in tights..."

	The typing stops.

	BARTON

	Looking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?

	HIS FEET

	Sliding back and forth  swimming  in his shoes, which are 
	several sizes too large.

	We hear a knock at the door.

	BARTON

	He rises and answers the door.

	Charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of 
	nicely shined shoes.

				CHARLIE
		I hope these are your shoes.

				BARTON
		Hi, Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		Because that would mean they gave 
		you mine.

				BARTON
		Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. 
		Come on in.

	The two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton 
	reaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had 
		one of those days?

				BARTON
		Seems like nothing but, lately.

	Chalrie perches on the edge of the bed.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, what a day. Felt like I 
		couldn't've sold ice water in the 
		Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't 
		want insurance, so okay, that's your 
		loss. But God, people can be rude. 
		Feel like I have to talk to a normal 
		person like just to restore a little 
		of my...

				BARTON
		Well, my pleasure. I could use a 
		little lift myself.

				CHARLIE
		A little lift, yeah...

	Smiling, he takes out his flask.

				CHARLIE
		...Good thing they bottle it, huh 
		pal?

	He takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a 
	shot:

				CHARLIE
		...Did I say rude? People can be 
		goddamn cruel. Especially some of 
		their housewives. Okay, so I've got 
		a weight problem. That's my cross to 
		bear. I dunno...

				BARTON
		Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.

				CHARLIE
		Defense against what? Insurance?  
		Something they need? Something they 
		should be thanking me for offering? 
		A little peace of mind?...

	He shakes his head.

				CHARLIE
		...Finally decided to knock off early, 
		take your advice. Went to see a doctor 
		about this.

	He indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.

				CHARLIE
		...He told me it was an ear infection.  
		Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I 
		told YOU my ear was infected. Why 
		don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, 
		THAT led to an argument...

	He gives a rueful chuckle.

				CHARLIE
		...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if 
		my problems amounted to a hill of 
		beans. How goes the life of the mind?

				BARTON
		Well, it's been better. I can't seem 
		to get going on this thing. That one 
		idea, the one that lets you get 
		started  I still haven't gotten it.  
		Maybe I only had one idea in me  my 
		play. Maybe once that was done, I 
		was done being a writer.  Christ, I 
		feel like a fraud, sitting here 
		staring at this paper.

				CHARLIE
		Those two love-birds next door drivin' 
		you nuts?

	Barton looks at him curiously.

				BARTON
		How did you know about that?

				CHARLIE
		Know about it? I can practically see 
		how they're doin' it. Brother, I 
		wish I had a piece of that.

				BARTON
		Yeah, but 

				CHARLIE
		Seems like I hear everything that 
		goes on in this dump. Pipes or 
		somethin'. I'm just glad I don't 
		have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee 
		hours.

	He laughs.

				CHARLIE
		...Ah, you'll lick this picture 
		business, believe me. You've got a 
		head on your shoulders. What is it 
		they say? Where there's a head, 
		there's a hope?

				BARTON
		Where there's life there's hope.

	Charlie laughs.

				CHARLIE
		That proves you really are a writer!

	Barton smiles.

				BARTON
		And there's hope for you too, Charlie.  
		Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen 
		policies.

				CHARLIE
		Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I 
		gotta pull up stakes temporarily.

				BARTON
		You're leaving?

				CHARLIE
		In a few days. Out to your stompin' 
		grounds as a matter of fact  New 
		York City. Things have gotten all 
		balled up at the Head Office.

				BARTON
		I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.  
		I'll miss you.

				CHARLIE
		Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long 
		face!  This is still home for me  I 
		keep my room, and I'll be back sooner 
		or later...

	Barton rises and walks over to his writing table.

				CHARLIE
		...And  mark my words  by the time 
		I get back you're picture'll be 
		finished. I know it.

	Barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie.

				BARTON
		New York can be pretty cruel to 
		strangers, Charlie. If you need a 
		home-cooked meal you just look up 
		Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live 
		on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.

	We hear a tacky, tearing sound.

	Barton looks toward the door.

	Charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton 
	sits.

	The two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau  the 
	slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a 
	hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close 
	together.

	THEIR POV

	A swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from 
	the wall. It sags and nods.

				CHARLIE
			(off)
		Christ!

	THE TWO MEN

	Frozen, looking.

				CHARLIE
		...Your room does that too?

				BARTON
		I guess the heat's sweating off the 
		wallpaper.

				CHARLIE
		What a dump...

	He heads for the door and Barton follows.

				CHARLIE
		...I guess it seems pathetic to a 
		guy like you.

				BARTON
		Well...

				CHARLIE
		Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean 
		to a guy from New York.

				BARTON
		What do you mean?

				CHARLIE
		This kind of heat. It's pathetic.

				BARTON
		Well, I guess you pick your poison.

				CHARLIE
		So they say.

				BARTON
		Don't pick up and leave without saying 
		goodbye.

				CHARLIE
		Course not, compadre. You'll see me 
		again.

	Barton closes the door.

	He goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter.  
	After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the 
	ceiling.

	We hear a loud thump.

	HIS POV

	The ceiling  a white, seamless space.

	As we track in the thumping continues  slowly, rhythmically, 
	progressively louder  the effect, it seems, of odd doings 
	upstairs.

	LOOKING DOWN ON BARTON

	From a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the 
	ceiling.

	We track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, 
	growing louder, sharper.

	HIS POV

	Moving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area 
	and cease to have any sense of movement.

	With a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame 
	to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is 
	gone, having left a huge black "T" stamped into the white 
	ceiling.

	We are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of 
	the key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear 
	rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The 
	thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.

	BEN GEISLER

	Is emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary 
	stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs 
	tonelessly, without looking up:

				SECRETARY
		Barton Fink.

				GEISLER
		Yeah. Fink. Come in.

	The clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises.

	GEISLER'S OFFICE

	The two men enter.

	This office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in 
	grays and black. There are pictures on the wall of Geisler 
	with various celebrities.

	Geisler sits behind his desk.

				GEISLER
		Wuddya got for me  what the hell 
		happened to your face?

				BARTON
		Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

				GEISLER
		Like hell it is; there are no 
		mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos 
		breed in swamps  this is a desert 
		town. Wuddya got for me?

				BARTON
		Well I...

				GEISLER
		On the Beery picture! Where are we? 
		Wuddya got?

				BARTON
		Well, to tell you the truth, I'm 
		having some trouble getting started

				GEISLER
		Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! 
		Started?!  You mean you don't have 
		ANYthing?!

				BARTON
		Well not much.

	Geisler leaps to his feet and paces.

				GEISLER
		What do you think this is? HAMLET? 
		GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED 
		GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big 
		men in tights! You know the drill!

				BARTON
		I'm afraid I don't really understand 
		that genre. maybe that's the prob-

				GEISLER
		Understand shit! I though you were 
		gonna consult another writer on this!

				BARTON
		Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-

				GEISLER
		Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a 
		souse!

				BARTON
		He's a great writer 

				GEISLER
		A souse!

				BARTON
		You don't understand. He's in pain,
		because he can't write-

				GEISLER
		Souse! Souse! He manages to write 
		his name on the back of his paycheck 
		every week!

				BARTON
		But... I thought no one cared about 
		this picture.

				GEISLER
		You thought! Where'd you get THAT 
		from?  You thought! I don't know 
		what the hell you said to Lipnik, 
		but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You 
		understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! 
		He's taken an interest. NEVER make 
		Lipnik like you. NEVER!

	Some puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness.

				BARTON
		I don't understand-

				GEISLER
		Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's 
		taken an interest! What the hell did 
		you say to him?

				BARTON
		I didn't say anything-

				GEISLER
		Well he's taken an interest!  That 
		means he'll make your life hell, 
		which I could care less about, but 
		since I drew the short straw to 
		supervise this turkey, he's gonna be 
		all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch 
		called me yesterday to ask how it's 
		going  don't worry, I covered for 
		you. Told him you were making progress 
		and we were all very excited. I told 
		him it was great, so now MY ass is 
		on the line.  He wants you to tell 
		him all about it tomorrow.

				BARTON
		I can't write anything by tomorrow.

				GEISLER
		Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't 
		read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell 
		him SOMEthing for Chrissake.

				BARTON
		Well what do I tell him?

	Geisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks 
	up a telephone.

				GEISLER
		Projection...

	As he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It 
	continues throughout the phone conversation.

				GEISLER
		... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of 
		the screening rooms free this 
		afternoon?...  Good, book it for me. 
		A writer named Fink is gonna come in 
		and you're gonna show him wrestling 
		pictures... I don't give a shit which 
		ones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a 
		minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg 
		shooting one now?... Show him some 
		of the dailies on that.

	He slams down the phone.

				GEISLER
		...This ought to give you some ideas.

	He jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton.

				GEISLER
		...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at 
		Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes.  
		Don't cross me, Fink.

	SCREEN

	Black-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick 
	enters and shouts:

				CLAPPER
		DEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker 
		take one.

	Clap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the 
	ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a 
	huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real 
	athlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and 
	he has a small mustache.

				VOICE
		Action.

	The wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center 
	ring and the camera. He affects a German accent:

				WRESTLER
		I will destroy him!

	He passes the camera.

				VOICE
		Cut.

	Flash frames.

	The clapper enters again.

				CLAPPER
		Twelve baker take two.

	Clap! He exits.

	The wrestler moves toward the camera.

				WRESTLER
		I will destroy him!

				VOICE
		Cut.

	The clapper enters

				CLAPPER
		Twelve baker take three.

	Clap!

				WRESTLER
		I will destroy him!

	SLOW TRACK IN ON BARTON

	Seated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the 
	projection beam flickering over his left shoulder.

	As we creep in closer:

				WRESTLER
			(off)
		I will destroy him!... I will destroy 
		him!... I will destroy him!... I 
		will destroy him!...

	Another off-microphone, distant voice from the screen:

				VOICE
		Okay, take five...

	THE SCREEN

	A jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. The wrestler is 
	standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down 
	his face as he smokes a cigarette.

	A cut in the film and another clapstick enters.

				CLAPPER
		Twelve charlie take one-

	ON THE CLAP:

	BACK TO BARTON

	Staring at the screen, dull, wan, and forlorn.

				VOICE
			(off)
		Action.

	THE SCREEN

	The angle is low  canvas level. We hold for a brief moment 
	on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into 
	frame.

	The German is underneath, on his back, pinned by the other 
	man.

	The referee enters, cropped at the knees, and throws counting 
	fingers down into frame.

				REFEREE
		One... two...

				WRESTLER
		AAAAHHHH!!

	The German bucks and throws his opponent out of frame.

				VOICE
		Cut.

				CLAPPER
		Twelve charlie take two.

	Crash.

				REFEREE
		One... two...

				WRESTLER
		AAAAHHHH!!

	BARTON

	Glazed.

				WRESTLER
			(off)
		AAAAAAHHHHHH!!... AAAAAAHHHHHH!!...  
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!...

	PAGE IN TYPEWRITER

	The screaming drops out abruptly at cut. We hear only the 
	sound of heavy footfalls on carpet.

	Below the opening paragraph, two new words have been added 
	to the typescript:

	"Orphan?"

	"Dame?"  

	The foot falls continue.

	THE HOTEL ROOM

	Night. Barton paces frantically back and forth.

	He looks at his watch.

	HIS POV

	It is 12:30.

	CLOSE ON THE PHONE

	It is lifted out of the cradle.

				BARTON
		Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 
		605. Can you try a number for me in 
		Hollywood...  Slausen 6-4304.

	We pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring 
	through.  Barton sweats.

				BARTON
		Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-

				AUDREY
		Hello.

				BARTON
		Audrey, listen, I need help. I know 
		it's late and I shouldn't be calling 
		you like this  believe me I wouldn't 
		have if I could see any other 
		alternative, but I  I'm sorry -
		listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You 
		doing okay?

				AUDREY
		...Who is this?

				BARTON
		Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.

	Through the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken 
	bellowing.

				MAYHEW
		Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all!

	We hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor.

				AUDREY
		Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good 
		time-

				MAYHEW
		Drown all those rascals...

				BARTON
		I'm sorry, I just feel like I know 
		I shouldn't ask, I just need some 
		kind of help, I just, I have a 
		deadline tomorrow-

				MAYHEW
		I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

	There is more clatter.

	Audrey's voice is hushed, close to the phone:

				AUDREY
		All right Barton, I'll see if I can 
		slip away-

				MAYHEW
		Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come 
		into the house... sons of bitches...

				BARTON
		If you could, I'd 

				AUDREY
		If I can. He gets jealous; he-

				MAYHEW
		Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!

				BARTON
		I need help, Audrey.

				AUDREY
		I'll try to slip out. If he quiets 
		down, passes out... I'm afraid he 
		thinks  well, he said you were a 
		buffoon, Barton. He becomes 
		irrational

				MAYHEW
		Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM!  
		DROWN 'EM! DROWN 

	WIDE ON THE ROOM

	Later. It is quiet. We are craning down toward the bed, where 
	Barton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow 
	as if to blot out the world.

	The track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: 
	1:30.

	THE HALLWAY

	At the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on 
	over the elevator, with a faint bell.

	BACK TO BARTON

	With two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow 
	off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his 
	watch.

	There is a knock at the door.

	Barton swings his feet off the bed.

	THE DOORWAY

	Barton opens the door to Audrey.

				AUDREY
		Hello, Barton.

				BARTON
		Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank 
		you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such 
		a... Thank you.

	They enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge 
	of the bed.

				AUDREY
		Now that's all right, Barton.  
		Everything'll be all right.

				BARTON
		Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?

				AUDREY
		Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll 
		sleep for a while now. What is it 
		you have to do, exactly?

	Barton paces.

				BARTON
		Well I have to come up with  an 
		outline, I'd guess you call it. The 
		story. The whole goddamn story. Soup 
		to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-

				AUDREY
		It's alright, Barton. You don't have 
		to write actual scenes?

				BARTON
		No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey?  
		Have you ever had to read any of 
		Bill's wrestling scenarios?

	Audrey laughs.

				AUDREY
		Yes, I'm afraid I have.

				BARTON
		What are they like? What are they 
		about?

				AUDREY
		Well, usually, they're... simply 
		morality tales. There's a good 
		wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he 
		confronts at the end. In between, 
		the good wrestler has a love interest 
		or a child he has to protect.  Bill 
		would usually make the good wrestler 
		a backwoods type, or a convict. And 
		sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd 
		have the wrestler protecting an idiot 
		manchild.  The studio always hated 
		that. Oh, some of the scripts were 
		so... spirited!

	She laughs  then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She 
	looks at Barton.

				AUDREY
		...Barton.

	She shakes her head.

				AUDREY
		...Look, it's really just a formula. 
		You don't have to type your soul 
		into it.  We'll invent some names 
		and a new setting.  I'll help you 
		and it won't take any time at all. I 
		did it for Bill so many times 

	Barton's pacing comes up short.

				BARTON
		Did what for Bill?

	Guardedly:

				AUDREY
		Well... THIS.

				BARTON
		You wrote his scripts for him?

				AUDREY
		Well, the basic ideas were frequently 
		his-

				BARTON
		You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus 
		Christ, you wrote his  what about 
		before that?

				AUDREY
		Before what?

				BARTON
		Before Bill came to Hollywood.

	Audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.

				AUDREY
		Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so 
		to speak-

				BARTON
		What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, 
		how long have you been his... 
		secretary?

				AUDREY
		Barton, I think we should concentrate 
		on OUR little project-

				BARTON
		I want to know how many of Bill's 
		books you wrote!

				AUDREY
		Barton!

				BARTON
		I want to know!

				AUDREY
		Barton, honestly, only the last couple-

				BARTON
		Hah!

				AUDREY
		And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,
		really, when he'd been drinking-

				BARTON
		I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand 
		productive days." What a goddamn 
		phony.

	He resumes pacing.

				BARTON
		...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn 
		Phony Mayhew. All his guff about 
		escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped!

	Barton sighs and looks at his watch.

				BARTON
		...Well, we don't have much time.

	He sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.

				AUDREY
		It'll be fine... Don't judge him, 
		Barton.  Don't condescend to him...

	She strokes Barton's hair.

				AUDREY
		...It's not as simple as you think. 
		I helped Bill most by appreciating 
		him, by understanding him. We all 
		need understanding, Barton. Even 
		you, tonight, it's all you really 
		need...

	She kisses him.

	As Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away.

	We frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward 
	the sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and 
	Barton's breath, becoming labored.

	The continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the 
	sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the 
	porcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped 
	by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of 
	pipes.

							BLACK

								FADE IN:

	BARTON

	The hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are 
	looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn.

	Barton's eyes snap open.

	HIS POV

	The white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the 
	white.

	BARTON

	Slowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following 
	the sound of the mosquito.

	His gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the 
	hum stops.

	HIS POV

	Audrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered 
	by a blanket.

	BARTON

	Gingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's 
	back.

	HIS POV

	The alabaster white of Audrey's back.

	The mosquito is feeding on it.

	EXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES

	Looking.

	EXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO

	Swelling with blood.

	WIDER

	As Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back.  

	She doesn't react.

	Barton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with 
	blood.

	ON BARTON

	He looks at his hand.

	HIS POV

	His hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood.

	BACK TO BARTON

	Eyes wide, he looks down at the bed.

	HIS POV

	Blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's 
	back.

	BARTON

	He pulls Audrey's shoulder.

	AUDREY

	She rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless.  

	Her stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to 
	her waist is drenched red and clings to her body.

	BARTON

	He screams.

	He screams again.

	We hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening 
	and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.  

	Barton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily 
	frozen.

	Another knock.

	Barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.

	THE DOORWAY

	Over Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door.

	Charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a 
	sleeveless tee.

				CHARLIE
		Are you all right?

	Barton stares dumbly for a moment.

				CHARLIE
		...Can I come in?

				BARTON
		No!... I'm fine. Thank you.

				CHARLIE
		Are you sure 

				BARTON
		No... no...

	Barton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face.  

	He walks back into the room.

	HIS POV

	Audrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed.

	BARTON

	He walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and 
	starts back toward the door.

	He stops short and turns back again to the room. He averts 
	his eyes  as it happens, toward the secretary.

	He walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.

	CLOSE ON BARTON

	As he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, 
	totally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed.  

	He stares for a long beat.

	Strange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not 
	in control.

	Becoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops.

	He lurches to his feet.

	THE DOORWAY

	As Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.

	HALLWAY

	Barton peers out the see if the coast is clear.

	HIS POV

	The long hallway.

	In the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping 
	in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him 
	is a castored shoe caddy.

	All of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes.

	CHET

	Close on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up.

	CHET'S POV

	Up the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing.

	CHET

	He pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the 
	shoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	Barton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak.  
	Eventually it becomes inaudible.

	He cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.

	HALLWAY

	Barton goes to Charlie's room and knocks.

	Footfalls end as the door is cracked open.

				CHARLIE
		Barton. Are you all right?

				BARTON
		No... Can I come in?

				CHARLIE
		Why don't we go to your room-

				BARTON
		Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta 
		help me.

	Once again he is breathing hard.

	Charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind 
	him.

				CHARLIE
		Get a grip on yourself, brother. 
		Whatever the problem is, we'll sort 
		it out.

				BARTON
		Charlie, I'm in trouble  something 
		horrible's happened  I've gotta 
		call the police...

	Charlie leads him towards his room.

				BARTON
		...Will you stay with me till they 
		get here?

				CHARLIE
		Don't worry about it, Barton. We can 
		sort it-

	He is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow 
	to stop him.

				BARTON
		Before you go in  I didn't do this. 
		I don't know how it happened, but I 
		didn't... I want you to know that...

	Charlie looks into his eyes. For a moment the two men stare 
	at each other  Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's 
	supplicating.

	Finally, Charlie nods.

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	He turns and pushes open the door.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	The two men enter.

	Barton lingers by the door. Charlie walks into the foreground 
	to look off toward the bed.

	His eyes widen and he screams.

	He turns and disappears into the bathroom. We hear vomiting, 
	then the flush of a toilet.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...

	His reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more 
	agitated.

	Charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is 
		this?  What're we gonna do?

				BARTON
		I've gotta call the police  or you 
		could call for me 

				CHARLIE
		Hold on 

				BARTON
		You gotta believe me 

				CHARLIE
		Hold on 

				BARTON
		I didn't do this, I did NOT do this

				CHARLIE
		Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. 
		Tell me what happened.

				BARTON
		I don't know! I woke up, she was... 
		God, you gotta believe me!

	Charlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances 
	back into the room.

				CHARLIE
		I believe you, brother, but this 
		don't look good.

				BARTON
		We gotta call the police 

				CHARLIE
		Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				CHARLIE
		What do you think happened?

				BARTON
		I don't know!  Maybe it was her...  
		boyfriend. I passed out. I don't 
		know.  Won't the police be able to 

				CHARLIE
		Stop with the police! Wake up, friend!  
		This does not look good! They hang 
		people for this!

				BARTON
		But I didn't do it  don't you believe 
		me?

				CHARLIE
		I believe you  I KNOW you. But why 
		should the police?

	Barton gives him a dumb stare.

				CHARLIE
		...Did you... Barton, between you 
		and me, did you have sexual 
		intercourse?

	Barton stares at Charlie. He swallows.

	Charlie shakes his head.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus... They can tell that...

				BARTON
		They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They 
		gotta have mercy!

				CHARLIE
		You're in pictures, Barton. Even if 
		you got cleared eventually, this 
		would ruin you.

	He turns and starts toward the bed.

				CHARLIE
		...Wait in the bathroom.

	BATHROOM

	Later. Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against 
	the wall, staring glassily at his feet.

	From the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the 
	sounds of bed clothes being torn off.

	Finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of 
	Charlie grunting under great weight.

	We hear heavy footsteps approaching.

	Barton looks up through the open bathroom door.

	HIS POV

	Charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the 
	sheetswaddled body in his arms.

	BACK TO BARTON

	His neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back 
	to hit the wall.

	BLACK

	Slap! Slap!  

	We are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap 
	and backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now 
	wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has 
	blood flecks across the belly.

				CHARLIE
		You passed out.

	Barton looks groggily up.

				BARTON
		...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?

				CHARLIE
		She's dead, Barton! If that was her 
		name.

	TRACKING IN ON BARTON

	He stares at Charlie.

				CHARLIE
			(off)
		Barton, listen to me. You gotta act 
		like nothing's happened. Put this 
		totally out of your head. I know 
		that's hard, but your play from here 
		on out is just to go about business 
		as usual. Give us some time to sort 
		this out...

	Barton looks at his watch.

	THE WATCH

	7:45.

				CHARLIE
			(off)
		...Just put it out of you head...

	TRACKING

	Toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and 
	statuary set amid palms trees.

	Sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching 
	Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.

				LIPNIK
		Bart! So happy to see ya!

	REVERSE

	Pulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze.

	Barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much 
	sun.

				LIPNIK
		Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then 
		talk!  Drink?

	As Barton sits:

				BARTON
		Yeah... rye whiskey?

				LIPNIK
		Boy! You writers! Work hard, play 
		hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...

	He laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze.

				LIPNIK
		... Lou.

	Lou exits.

				LIPNIK
		Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're 
		going along great.  Thinks we've got 
		a real winner in this one. And let 
		me tell you something, I'm counting 
		on it. I've taken an interest. Not 
		to interfere, mind you  hardly seems 
		necessary in your case. A writer  a 
		storyteller  of your stature.  
		Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. 
		Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting 
		in the audience, the lights go down, 
		Capitol logo comes up... you're on!

	He beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched 
	lips.

				BARTON
		Yeah, okay... well... we fade in...

	Lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.

				BARTON
		...It's a tenement building. On the 
		Lower East Side...

				LIPNIK
		Great! He's poor, this wrestler! 
		He's had to struggle!

				BARTON
		And then... well...

	Barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits 
	against the sun. He looks back at Lipnik.

				BARTON
		...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?

				LIPNIK
		CAN you?  You damn well better be. 
		Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my 
		business dealings  well, of course, 
		you can't always be honest, not with 
		the sharks swimming around this town 
		 but if you're a writer, you don't 
		think about those things  if I'd 
		been totally honest, I wouldn't be 
		within a mile of this pool  unless 
		I was cleaning it. But that's no 
		reason for you not to be. Honest, I 
		mean.  Not cleaning the pool.

	Lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. 
	Lou sits.

	Barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, 
	but must finally take the plunge.

				BARTON
		Well... to be honest, I'm never really 
		comfortable discussing a work in 
		progress.  I've got it all worked 
		out in my head, but sometimes if you 
		force it out in words  prematurely 
		 the wrong words  well, your meaning 
		changes, and it changes your own 
		mind, and you never get it back  so 
		I'd just as soon not talk about it.

	Lipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a 
	long beat.

	Lou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to 
	fill the silence.

				LOU
		...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never 
		mind how long I've been in pictures. 
		Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just 
		about since they were invented. HE 
		practically invented them.

	Lipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou.

				LOU
		...Now I think if he's interested in 
		what one of his contract employees 
		is doing while he draws pay, I think 
		that employee ought to tell him, if 
		he wants to stay an employee. Right 
		now the contents of your head are 
		the property of Capitol Pictures, so 
		if I were you I would speak up. And 
		pretty goddamn fast.

	Lou looks at Barton, expectantly. Lipnik continues to stare 
	at Lou.

	There is a long silence, terribly heavy.

	Finally, Lipnik explodes  at Lou.

				LIPNIK
		You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling 
		this man  this ARTIST  what to 
		do?!

	Lou Breeze is stunned.

				LOU
		Mr. Lipnik, I 

				LIPNIK
		This man creates for a living! He 
		puts food on your table and on mine! 
		THANK him for it!  Thank him, you 
		ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or 
		YOU'RE fired!

	Barton is staring, aghast.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-

	Lipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton. 
	He rises and points.

				LIPNIK
		Get down on your knees, you 
		sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees 
		and kiss this man's feet!

				LOU
		Mr. Lipnik, please 

				BARTON
		I  Mr. Lipnik 

				LIPNIK
		KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!

	Lou, aghast, looks at Barton.

	Barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look.

	Lipnik snarls at Lou:

				LIPNIK
		...Okay, get out of here. You're 
		fired, you understand me?  Get out 
		of my sight.

	Lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, I 

				LIPNIK
		I apologize, Barton.

				BARTON
		No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been 
		a great help 

				LIPNIK
		You don't have to cover for him. 
		It's noble of you, but these things 
		happen in business.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much 
		better if you could reconsider 

				LIPNIK
		Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to 
		pull this out of your head. If that 
		sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to 
		you, goddammit, I will. I respect 
		your artistry and your methods, and 
		if you can't fill us in yet, well 
		hell, we should be kissing your feet 
		for your fine efforts.

	He gets down on his knees in front of Barton.

				LIPNIK
		...You know in the old country we 
		were taught, as very young children, 
		that there's no shame in supplicatin' 
		yourself when you respect someone.

	Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his 
	feet.

				LIPNIK
		...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, 
		the administration, and all a the 
		stockholders, please accept this as 
		a symbol of our apology and respect.

	BARTON'S POV

	Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.

	Behind Lipnik the pool glitters.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	The cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a 
	loud but distorted thumping noise.

	We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. 
	We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, 
	hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the 
	bed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt 
	and his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets 
	have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous 
	rust-red stain in the middle.

	After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: 
	A bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near 
	wall.

	Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a 
	knock at the door.

	Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door.

	THE DOOR

	Barton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, 
	his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. 
	It is the first time we have seen him well turned out.

	A battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a 
	parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in 
	brown paper and tied up with twine.

				CHARLIE
		Barton. Can I come in?

	Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his 
	briefcase and enters.

	THE ROOM

	As the two men enter.

				BARTON
		Jesus... You're leaving.

				CHARLIE
		Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

	Barton sounds desperate:

				BARTON
		Jesus, Charlie, I...

				CHARLIE
		Everything's okay, believe me. I 
		know it's rough mentally, but 
		everything's taken care of.

				BARTON
		Charlie! I've got no one else here! 
		You're the only person I know in Los 
		Angeles...

	He starts weeping

				BARTON
		...that I can talk to.

	Charlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around 
	Barton.

	Barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber.

				CHARLIE
		It's okay... It's okay...

				BARTON
		Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy 
		 like I'm losing my mind. I don't 
		know what to do... I didn't do it, 
		believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. 
		I just...

	His breath comes in short gasping heaves.

				BARTON
		...I just don't know what... to do

				CHARLIE
		You gotta get a grip on, brother. 
		You gotta just carry on  just for a 
		few days, till I get back. Try and 
		stay here, keep your door locked. 
		Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta 
		keep our heads and we'll figure it 
		out.

				BARTON
		Yeah, but Charlie 

				CHARLIE
		Dammit, don't argue with me. You 
		asked me to believe you  well I do.  
		Now don't argue with me.

	He looks at Barton for a beat.

				CHARLIE
		...Look, pal  can you do something 
		for me?

	Charlie hands him his parcel.

				CHARLIE
		...Keep this for me, till I get back.

	Barton, snuffling, accepts the package.

				CHARLIE
		...It's just personal stuff. I don't 
		wanna drag it with me, but I don't 
		trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like 
		to think it's in good hands.

	Still snuffling:

				BARTON
		Sure, Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		Funny, huh, when everything that's 
		important to a guy, everything he 
		wants to keep from a lifetime  when 
		he can fit it into a little box like 
		that. I guess... I guess it's kind 
		of pathetic.

	Wallowing in self-pity:

				BARTON
		It's more than I've got.

				CHARLIE
		Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll 
		bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll 
		help you finish your script. You'll 
		think about me...

	He thumps his chest.

				CHARLIE
		...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll 
		lick that story of yours.

	Barton is tearfully sincere:

				BARTON
		Thanks, Charlie.

	Charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. 
		You're gonna be fine.

	Barton shakes. As they walk to the door:

				BARTON
		You'll be back?

				CHARLIE
		Don't worry about that, compadre. 
		I'll be back.

	Barton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns 
	around.

	HIS POV

	The room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress.

	Barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge 
	of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat, 
	he sits still, but something is building inside.

	Finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator 
	arriving for Charlie, it erupts:

	Barton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned 
	child.

	HIGH WIDE SHOT

	Barton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored 
	stain.

								FADE OUT

								FADE IN:

	BATHING BEAUTY

	With the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up.

	We pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been 
	tucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of 
	Charlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running 
	board of the 1939 Ford roadster.

	BARTON

	Sitting at the desk, staring at the picture. From his glazed 
	eyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has 
	been staring at the picture for some time.

	He notices something on the desk and picks it up.

	HIS POV

	The Holy Bible  Placed by the Gideons.

	Barton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel. The text 
	is set in ornately Gothic type.

	"5. And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the 
	Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known 
	unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in 
	pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."

	BARTON

	Staring at the passage. His mouth hangs open.

	THE BIBLE

	Barton riffles to the first page.

	In bold type at the top:

	"THE BOOK OF GENESIS"

	Underneath, in the same ornately Gothic type:

	"Chapter One 1. Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's 
	Lower East Side.  Faint traffic noise is audible; 2. As is 
	the cry of fishmongers."

	BARTON

	Squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes.

	His mouth hangs open.

	BARTON'S ROOM  DAY

	At the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in. 
	Sunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making 
	it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains 
	fairly dim.

	Barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously.

	He finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places 
	it face-down on a short stack of face-down pages.

	He feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He 
	is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we 
	left him the previous night.

	The telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing 
	and answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His 
	voice is hoarse.

				BARTON
		Hello... Chet... Who?...

	He puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the 
	typewriter, and examines something he has just written.

	He picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.

				BARTON
		... No, don't send them up here. 
		I'll be right down.

	ELEVATOR

	A small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator.  

	We pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old 
	elevator operator. Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.

				BARTON
		...You read the Bible, Pete?

				PETE
		Holy Bible?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				PETE
		I think so... Anyway, I've heard 
		about it.

	Barton nods.

	They ride for a beat.

	LOBBY

	Late afternoon sun slants in from one side. The lobby has 
	the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it.

	Barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, 
	from which two men in suits are rising. One is tall, the 
	other short.

				POLICEMAN
		Fink?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				POLICEMAN #2
		Detective Mastrionotti.

				POLICEMAN #1
		Detective Deutsch.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		L.A.P.D.

				BARTON
		Uh-huh.

	All three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. Mastrionotti 
	perches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the 
	shadows, studying Barton.

				DEUTSCH
		Got a couple questions to ask ya.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		What do you do, Fink?

	Still hoarse:

				BARTON
		I write.

				DEUTSCH
		Oh yeah? What kind of write?

				BARTON
		Well as a matter of fact, I write 
		for the pictures.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Big fuckin' deal.

				DEUTSCH
		You want my partner to kiss your 
		ass?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Would that be good enough for ya?

				BARTON
		No, I  I didn't mean to sound 

				DEUTSCH
		What DID you mean?

				BARTON
		I  I've got respect for  for working 
		guys, like you 

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You 
		live in 605?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				DEUTSCH
		How long you been up there, Fink?

				BARTON
		A week, eight, nine days 

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Is this multiple choice?

				BARTON
		Nine days  Tuesday 

				DEUTSCH
		You know this slob?

	He is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward 
	Barton.

	There is a long beat as Barton studies the picture.

				BARTON
		...Yeah, he... he lives next door to 
		me.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		That's right, Fink, he lives next 
		door to you.

				DEUTSCH
		Ever talk to him?

				BARTON
		...Once or twice. His name is Charlie 
		Meadows.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

				DEUTSCH
		His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Also known as Madman Mundt.

				DEUTSCH
		He's a little funny in the head.

				BARTON
		What did... What did he 

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate 
		people with a shotgun and then cut 
		their heads off.

				DEUTSCH
		Yeah, he's funny that way.

				BARTON
		I...

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Started in Kansas City. Couple of 
		housewives.

				DEUTSCH
		Couple of days ago we see the same 
		M.O. out in Los Feliz.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.

				DEUTSCH
		All of which he's now missin'.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Well, some of his throat was there.

				DEUTSCH
		Physician, heal thyself.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Good luck with no fuckin' head.

				DEUTSCH
		Anyway.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Hollywood precinct finds another 
		stiff yesterday. Not too far from 
		here. This one's better looking than 
		the doc.

				DEUTSCH
		Female caucasian, thirty years old. 
		Nice tits. No head. You ever see 
		Mundt with anyone meets that 
		description?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		But, you know, with the head still 
		on.

				BARTON
		...No. I never saw him with anyone 
		else.

				DEUTSCH
		So. You talked to Mundt, what about?

				BARTON
		Nothing, really. Said he was in the 
		insurance business.

	Deutsch indicates Mastrionotti.

				DEUTSCH
		Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		No reputable company would hire a 
		guy like that.

				BARTON
		Well that's what he said.

				DEUTSCH
		What else?

				BARTON
		He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, 
		really... He... He said he liked 
		Jack Oakie pictures.

	Mastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti.  
	After a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say 
		anything you might remember could be 
		helpful. But I'll be frank with you: 
		That is not helpful.

				DEUTSCH
		Ya see how he's not writing it down?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't 
		it?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

	Mastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Yeah, I didn't think this dump was 
		restricted.

	He digs in his pocket.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...Mundt has disappeared. I don't 
		think he'll be back. But...

	He hands Barton a card.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...give me a call if you see him. Or 
		if you remember something that isn't 
		totally idiotic.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	We are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on 
	the nightstand next to Barton's bed.   

	Barton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking 
	at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits.

	He shakes it.

	No sound; whatever is inside is well packed.

	Barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, 
	as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf.  

	Finally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the 
	bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.

								DISSOLVE

						    THROUGH TO:

	REVERSE

	Some time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond 
	him we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain.

	The phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring.  

	Barton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the 
	background. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile 
	as the phone continues ringing.

	Barton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear. 
	He resumes typing.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Barton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the 
	typewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters.

	Barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places 
	it face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in 
	a new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the 
	hall. Barton resumes typing.

	We hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react, 
	apparently not hearing.

	THE DOORWAY

	We are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway 
	is sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears 
	and his footsteps recede.

	The note is a printed message headed: "While You Were Out... 
	" Underneath are the printed words: "You were called by" 
	and, handwritten in the space following: "Mr. Ben Geisler."  

	Handwritten below, in the message space:

	"Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work." 

	Barton's offscreen typing continues steadily.

								FADE OUT

	HALLWAY

	A perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty 
	hall.  Shoes are set put in front of each door except for 
	one in the middle background.

	At the cut in we hear faint, regular typing.

	We hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall. 
	The distant typing.

	We hold.

	The typing stops. There is a beat of quiet.

	It is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the 
	shoeless door in the middle background.

	A hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway.  

	The hand withdraws.

	The door closes.

	A short beat of silence.

	The distant typing resumes.

	The long empty hall. The distant typing.

								FADE OUT

	OVER THE BLACK

	We hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and 
	indistinct.

				WOMAN
		Just a minute and I'll connect you...

								FADE IN:

	CLOSE ON BARTON

	His eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his 
	bed holding the phone to his ear.

	His voice is unnaturally loud:

				BARTON
		Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh!

	He stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear.

	We hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines 
	switch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or 
	four times before it is answered by a groggy voice.

				VOICE
		...Hello.

				BARTON
		Garland, it's me.

				GARLAND
		Barton? What time is it? Are you all 
		right?

				BARTON
		Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to 
		talk to you. I'm calling long 
		distance.

				GARLAND
		Okay.

	Muffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else.

				GARLAND
		...It's Barton. Calling long distance.

	Back into the receiver:

				GARLAND
		...What is it Barton? Are you okay?

				BARTON
		I'm fine, garland, but I have to 
		talk with you.

				GARLAND
		Go ahead, son.

				BARTON
		It's about what I'm writing, Garland. 
		It's really... I think it's really 
		big.

				GARLAND
		What do you mean, Barton?

				BARTON
		Not big in the sense of large  
		although it's that too. I mean 
		important. This may be the most 
		IMPORTANT work I've done.

				GARLAND
		Well, I'm... glad to hear that 

				BARTON
		Very important, Garland. I just 
		thought you should know that. Whatever 
		happens.

				GARLAND
		...That's fine.

				BARTON
		Have you read the Bible, Garland?

				GARLAND
		...Barton, is everything okay?

				BARTON
		Yes... Isn't it?

				GARLAND
		Well, I'm just asking. You sound a 
		little 

	Guardedly:

				BARTON
		Sound a little what?

				GARLAND
		Well, you just... sound a little

	Bitterly:

				BARTON
		Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the 
		encouragement.

	He slams down the phone.

	OVER HIS SHOULDER

	A one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the 
	cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear.

	He resumes typing, furiously.

	After a beat he mutters, still typing.

				BARTON
		...Nitwit.

	THE BATHING BEAUTY

	Later. We hear typing and the roar of the surf.'

	CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER

	We are extremely close on the key-strike area. As we cut in 
	Barton is typing:

	"p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-."

	The carriage returns a couple of times and "T-H-EE-N-D" is 
	typed in.

	The paper is ripped out of the carriage.

	CLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES

	Lying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face 
	down, to the pile.  The pile is picked up, its edges are 
	straightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop, 
	and then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up.  The 
	title page reads:

	"THE BURLYMAN 
	Motion Picture Scenario 
	By 
	Barton Fink"

	Barton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton 
	wad on top of the script.

	Barton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton 
	wad on top of the script.

	We hear Barton walk away. We hear bath water run.

	THE BATHING BEAUTY

	Still looking out to sea.

	USO HALL

	We are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band 
	plays an up-tempo number.

	BARTON

	Dancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing 
	the air.

	The hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in 
	uniform.

	USO GIRL

	Giggling, dancing opposite Barton.

				GIRL
		You're cute!

	BARTON

	Caught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl.

	A white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the 
	shoulder.

				SAILOR
		'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?

	Barton glares at him.

				BARTON
		This is MY dance, sailor!

				SAILOR
		C'mon buddy, I'm shipping out 
		tomorrow.

	For some reason, Barton is angry.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer! Celebrating the 
		completion of something GOOD!  Do 
		you understand that, sailor? I'm a 
		WRITER!

	His bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention.

				VOICES
		Step aside, four-eyes! Let someone 
		else spin the dame! Give the navy a 
		dance! Hey, Four-F, take a hike!

	Barton turns furiously against the crowd.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!  
		He points at his head.

				BARTON
		...This is my uniform!

	He taps his skull.

				BARTON
		...THIS is how I serve the common 
		man!  THIS is where I 

	WHAPP! An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button. 
	Bodies surge. The crowd gasps. The band blares nightmarishly 
	on.

	HOTEL HALLWAY

	Quiet at the cut.

	After a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall 
	and, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear:

				PETE
		This stop: six.

	Barton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the 
	hall. He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and 
	enters the room.

	BARTON'S POV

	Mastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading 
	Barton's manuscript.

	Deutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing 
	beauty.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Mother: What is to become of him. 
		Father: We'll be hearing from that 
		crazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a 
		postcard. Fade out. The end.

	He looks up at Barton.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...I thought you said you were a 
		writer.

				DEUTSCH
		I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.

				BARTON
		Keep your filthy eyes off that.

	Deutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at 
	him.

				DEUTSCH
		You made morning papers, Fink.

	Barton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found 
	Headless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures  a 
	studio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the 
	crime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a 
	gulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Second one of your friends to end up 
		dead.

				DEUTSCH
		You didn't tell us you knew the dame.

	With a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the 
	bloodstained bed.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

				DEUTSCH
		Give you nose bleeds?

	Barton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, 
	staring at the newspaper.

				DEUTSCH
		Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd 
		you put their heads?

	Distractedly:

				BARTON
		Charlie... Charlie's back...

				MASTRIONOTTI
		No kidding, bright boy  we smelt 
		Mundt all over this. Was he the idea 
		man?

				DEUTSCH
		Tell us where the heads are, maybe 
		they'll go easy on you.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Only fry you once.

	Barton rubs his temples.

				BARTON
		Could you come back later?  It's 
		just...  too hot... My head is killing 
		me.

				DEUTSCH
		All right, forget the heads. Where's 
		Mundt, Fink?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		He teach you to do it?

				DEUTSCH
		You two have some sick sex thing?

				BARTON
		Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!

				MASTRIONOTTI
		You're a sick fuck, Fink.

				DEUTSCH
		All right, moron, you're under arrest.

	Barton seems oblivious to the two men.

				BARTON
		Charlie's back. It's hot... He's 
		back.

	Down the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator.  

	Mastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look.

	He rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces 
	him go.

	HIS POV

	Mastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, 
	still looking puzzled.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...Fred...

	Deutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on 
	his hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He 
	unhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist 
	and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of 
	the bed.

				DEUTSCH
		Sit tight, Fink.

	THE HALLWAY

	As Deutsch joins Mastrionotti.

				DEUTSCH
		Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...Fred...

	Deutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking.

	THE WALL

	Tacky yellow fluid streams down. The walls are pouring sweat.  

	The hallway is quiet.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	They look at each other. They look down the hall.

	THEIR POV

	The elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall.  

	For a long beat, nothing.

	Finally Pete, the elevator man, emerges.

	At this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way 
	and that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head.  

	He turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few 
	steps forward, still clutching his head.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Watching.

	PETE

	He takes on last step, then collapses.

	As he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head. His 
	head separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away 
	from his body with a dull irregular trundle sound.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Wide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall.  

	All is quiet.

	THE HALLWAY

	Smoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall.  

	We hear a muted rumble.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Mastrionotti tugs at his tie. He slowly unholsters his gun.  
	Deutsch slowly, hypnotically, follows suit.

				DEUTSCH
		... Show yourself, Mundt!

	More quiet.

	THE HALLWAY

	More smoke.

	LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR

	The crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the 
	hall.

	It flickers with red light from below. Bottom-lit smoke sifts 
	up.

	CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI

	Standing in the foreground, gun at ready. Sweat pours down 
	his face.

	Behind him, Deutsch stands nervously in the light-spill from 
	Barton's doorway.

	The rumble and crackle of fire grows louder.

	THE HALLWAY

	More smoke.

	PATCH OF WALL

	Sweating.

	A swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall, 
	exposing glistening lath underneath.

	With a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Sweating.

				DEUTSCH
		...Mundt!

	THEIR POV

	The hallway. Its end-facing-wall slowly spreads flame from 
	where the wallpaper droops.

	LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR

	More red bottom-lit smoke seeps up from the crack between 
	elevator and hallway floors.

	With a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the 
	elevator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the 
	doorway.

	JUMPING BACK

	Wide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the 
	elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame.

	His suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. 
	From his right hand his briefcase dangles.

	He stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental 
	in his posture, shoulders thrown back.

	MASTRIONOTTI

	Tensed. Behind him, Deutsch gulps.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy 
		case down and your mitts in the air.

	CHARLIE

	He leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor.

	CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI

	Relax. He murmurs:

				MASTRIONOTTI
		He's complying.

	BACK TO CHARLIE

	He straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in 
	his hands.

	BOOM! The shotgun spits fire.

	Mastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown 
	back down the hallway into Deutsch.

	Bellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire:

				CHARLIE
		LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL 
		SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!

	THE HALLWAY

	The fire starts racing down the hallway.

	CLOSE STEEP ANGLE ON PATCH OF WALL

	Fire races along the wall-sweat goopus.

	TRACK IN ON DEUTSCH

	His eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun 
	dangles forgotten from his right hand.

	HIS POV

	Charlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun 
	loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. The 
	fire races along with him.

	He is bellowing:

				CHARLIE
		LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
		OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
		OF THE MIND!

	DEUTSCH

	Terrified, he turns and runs.

	REVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH

	As he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, 
	and Karl Mundt  who, also on the run, levels his shotgun.

	BOOM!

	PUSHING DEUTSCH

	His legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, 
	then come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown 
	tires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor.

	PULLING CHARLIE

	He slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun.

	PUSHING DEUTSCH

	Weeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows.

	PULLING CHARLIE

	He slows to a walk.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	Barton strains at his handcuffs.

	HIS POV

	Through the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two 
	shells into his shotgun.

	PULLING DEUTSCH

	Charlie looms behind him and  THWACK  snaps the shotgun 
	closed.

	Deutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie.  

	Charlie primes the shotgun  CLACK.

	He presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose.

				CHARLIE
		Heil Hitler.

	DEUTSCH

	Screams.

	CHARLIE

	Tightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.

	BLAM!

	TRACK IN ON BARTON

	He flinches.

	The gunshot echoes away.

	Barton strains at the handcuffs.

	We hear Charlie's footsteps approach  slowly, heavily.

	THE DOORWAY

	Charlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly 
	surprised to see Barton. The set of his jaw relaxes. His 
	expression softens. He pushes his hat farther back on his 
	head.

				CHARLIE
		Barton!

	He shakes is head and whistles.

				CHARLIE
		...Brother, is it hot.

	He walks into the room.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	As Charlie wearily enters.

				CHARLIE
		How you been, buddy?

	He props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who 
	stared at him.

				CHARLIE
		...Don't look at me like that, 
		neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.

				BARTON
		I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

	Charlie reaches a flask from his pocket.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, people can be cruel...

	He takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted 
	stare.

				CHARLIE
		...if it's not my build, it's my 
		personality.

	Charlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the 
	hallway.

				CHARLIE
		...They say I'm a madman, Barton, 
		but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest 
		I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry 
		for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to 
		think about what they're going 
		through. How trapped they are. I 
		understand it. I feel for 'em. So I 
		try and help them out...

	He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels 
		like, when things get all balled up 
		at the head office. It puts you 
		through hell, Barton. So I help people 
		out. I just wish someone would do as 
		much for me...

	He stares miserably down at his feet.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets 
		so hot, I wanna crawl right out of 
		my skin.

	Self-pity:

				BARTON
		But Charlie  why me? Why 

				CHARLIE
		Because you DON'T LISTEN!

	A tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and 
	running down his cheek.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus, I'm dripping again.

	He pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.

				CHARLIE
		...C'mon Barton, you think you know 
		about pain? You think I made your 
		life hell?  Take a look around this 
		dump. You're just a tourist with a 
		typewriter, Barton. I live here. 
		Don't you understand that...

	His voice is becoming choked.

				CHARLIE
		...And you come into MY home... And 
		you complain that I'M making too... 
		much... noise.

	He looks up at Barton.

	There is a long silence.

	Finally:

				BARTON
		...I'm sorry.

	Wearily:

				CHARLIE
		Don't be.

	He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the 
	foot of the bed.

	The two men regard each other.

	Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring 
	at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His 
	neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face 
	is a reddening grimace.

	With a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which 
	Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton 
	slides the cuff off it, free.

	Charlie gets to his feet.

				CHARLIE
		I'm getting off the merry-go-round.

	He takes his shotgun and walks to the door.

				CHARLIE
		...I'll be next door if you need me.

	A thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton.  
	Behind him the hallway blazes.

				CHARLIE
		...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. 
		And Uncle Dave?

	He smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.

				CHARLIE
		...Good people. By the way, that 
		package I gave you? I lied. It isn't 
		mine.

	He leaves.

	Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.

	THE HALLWAY

	As Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the 
	wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the 
	hallway. Barton looks down the hall.

	HIS POV

	Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase 
	dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket 
	for his key.

	With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped 
	with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel 
	after a long hard day on the road.

	He opens the door and goes into his room.

	BACK TO BARTON

	He turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, 
	the parcel in the other.

	A horrible moaning sound  almost human  can be heard under 
	the roar of the fire.

	BLACKNESS

	STUDIO HALLWAY

	We are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive 
	building. From offscreen we hear:

				BARTON
		Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- 
		five Fulton Street!

	Filtered through phone:

				OPERATOR
		I understand that, sir 

				BARTON
		Or Uncle Dave!

	Our track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, 
	unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway 
	in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry 
	up.

				OPERATOR
		I understand that, sir, but there's 
		still no answer. Shall I check for 
		trouble on the line?

	Barton slams down the phone.

	LIPNIK'S OFFICE

	Barton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel.

	Lou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton.  
	Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.

				LIPNIK
		Fink.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik.

				LIPNIK
		Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.

	He turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a 
	smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the 
	chest.

				LIPNIK
		...Siddown.

	Barton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.

				LIPNIK
		...I was commissioned yesterday in 
		the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau 
		arranged it. He's a dear friend.

				BARTON
		Congratulations.

				LIPNIK
		Actually it hasn't officially gone 
		through yet. Had wardrobe whip this 
		up. You gotta pull teeth to get 
		anything done in this town. I can 
		understand a little red tape in 
		peacetime, but now it's all-out 
		warfare against the Japs. Little 
		yellow bastards.  They'd love to see 
		me sit this one out.

				BARTON
		Yes sir, they 

				LIPNIK
		Anyway, I had Lou read your script 
		for me.

	He taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a 
	slightly charred title page.

				LIPNIK
		...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't 
		wash.

				BARTON
		With all due respect, sir, I think 
		it's the best work I've done.

				LIPNIK
		Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion 
		mattered, then I guess I'd resign 
		and let YOU run the the studio. It 
		doesn't and you won't, and the 
		lunatics are not going to run THIS 
		particular asylum. So let's put a 
		stop to THAT rumor right now.

	Listlessly:

				BARTON
		Yes sir.

				LIPNIK
		I had to call Beery this morning, 
		let him know we were pushing the 
		picture back.  After all I'd told 
		him about quality, about that Barton 
		Fink feeling. How disappointed we 
		were. Wally was heartbroken. The man 
		was devastated. He was  well, I 
		didn't actually call him, Lou did. 
		But that's a fair description, isn't 
		it Lou?

				LOU
		Yes, Colonel.

				LIPNIK
		Hell, I could take you through it 
		step by step, explain why your story 
		stinks, but I won't insult your 
		intelligence. Well all right, first 
		of all: This is a wrestling picture; 
		the audience wants to see action, 
		drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. 
		They don't wanna see a guy wrestling 
		with his soul  well, all right, a 
		little bit, for the critics  but 
		you make it the carrot that wags the 
		dog. Too much of it and they head 
		for exits and I don't blame 'em.  
		There's plenty of poetry right inside 
		that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten 
		Feet Square".

				LOU
		"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".

				LIPNIK
		Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". 
		These are big movies, Fink. About 
		big men, in tights  both physically 
		and mentally. But especially 
		physically. We don't put Wallace 
		Beery in some fruity movie about 
		suffering  I thought we were together 
		on that.

				BARTON
		I'm sorry if I let you down.

				LIPNIK
		You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. 
		We don't live or die by what you 
		scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler 
		down. He liked you. Trusted you. And 
		that's why he's gone. Fired.  That 
		guy had a heart as big as the 
		outdoors, and you fucked him. He 
		tried to convince me to fire you 
		too, but that would be too easy. No, 
		you're under contract and you're 
		gonna stay that way.  Anything you 
		write will be the property of Capitol 
		Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will 
		not produce anything you write. Not 
		until you grow up a little. You ain't 
		no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn 
		write-off.

				BARTON
		I tried to show you something 
		beautiful.  Something about all of 
		US 

	This sets Lipnik off:

				LIPNIK
		You arrogant sonofabitch!  You think 
		you're the only writer who can give 
		me that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got 
		twenty writers under contract that I 
		can ask for a Finktype thing from. 
		You swell-headed hypocrite!  You 
		just don't get it, do you?  You think 
		the whole world revolves inside 
		whatever rattles inside that little 
		kike head of yours. Get him outta my 
		sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in 
		town, though; he's still under 
		contract. I want you in town, Fink, 
		and outta my sight. Now get lost. 
		There's a war on.

	THE SURF

	Crashing against the Pacific shore.

	THE BEACH

	At midday, almost deserted. In the distance we see Barton 
	walking.

	The paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left 
	hand.

	BARTON

	He walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking 
	out to see. His gaze shifts to one side.

	HIS POV

	Down the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the 
	water. She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's 
	hotel room.

	BARTON

	He stares, transfixed, at the woman.

	THE WOMAN

	Very beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching.

	BARTON

	Following her with his eyes.

	THE WOMAN

	Her eyes meet Barton's. She says something, but her voice is 
	lost in the crash of the surf.

	Barton cups a hand to his ear.

				BEAUTY
		I said it's a beautiful day...

				BARTON
		Yes... It is...

				BEAUTY
		What's in the box?

	Barton shrugs and shakes his head.

				BARTON
		I don't know.

				BEAUTY
		Isn't it yours?

				BARTON
		I... I don't know...

	She nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from 
	him, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at 
	Barton.

				BARTON
		...You're very beautiful. Are you in 
		pictures?

	She laughs.

				BEAUTY
		Don't be silly.

	She turns away to look out at the sea.

	WIDER

	Facing the ocean. Barton sits in the middle foreground, back 
	to us, the box in the sand next to him.

	The bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background.  
	The surf pounds.

	The sun sparkles off the water.

	THE END
BARTON FINK

                                        Screenplay

                                            By

                                  Ethan Coen & Joel Coen


								FADE IN:

	ON BARTON FINK

	He is a bespectacled man in his thirties, hale but somewhat 
	bookish. He stands, tuxedoed, in the wings of a theater, 
	looking out at the stage, listening intently to end of a 
	performance.

	In the shadows behind him an old stagehand leans against a 
	flat, expressionlessly smoking a cigarette, one hand on a 
	thick rope that hangs from the ceiling.

	The voices of the performing actors echo in from the offscreen 
	stage:

				ACTOR
		I'm blowin' out of here, blowin' for 
		good.  I'm kissin' it all goodbye, 
		these four stinkin' walls, the six 
		flights up, the el that roars by at 
		three A.M. like a castiron wind. 
		Kiss 'em goodbye for me, Maury!  
		I'll miss 'em  like hell I will!

				ACTRESS
		Dreaming again!

				ACTOR
		Not this time, Lil! I'm awake now, 
		awake for the first time in years. 
		Uncle Dave said it: Daylight is a 
		dream if you've lived with your eyes 
		closed. Well my eyes are open now! I 
		see that choir, and I know they're 
		dressed in rags! But we're part of 
		that choir, both of us  yeah, and 
		you, Maury, and Uncle Dave too!

				MAURY
		The sun's coming up, kid. They'll be 
		hawking the fish down on Fulton 
		Street.

				ACTOR
		Let 'em hawk. Let 'em sing their 
		hearts out.

				MAURY
		That's it, kid. Take that ruined 
		choir.  Make it sing!

				ACTOR
		So long, Maury.

				MAURY
		So long.

	We hear a door open and close, then approaching footsteps. A 
	tall, dark actor in a used tweed suit and carrying a beat-up 
	valise passes in front of Barton: From offscreen stage:

				MAURY
		We'll hear from that kid. And I don't 
		mean a postcard.

	The actor sets the valise down and then stands waiting int 
	he shadows behind Barton.

	An older man in work clothes  not wardrobe  passes in front 
	of Barton from the other direction, pauses at the edge of 
	the stage and cups his hands to his mouth.

				OLDER MAN
		FISH! FRESH FISH!

	As the man walks back off the screen:

				LILY
		Let's spit on our hands and get to 
		work.  It's late, Maury.

				MAURY
		Not any more Lil...

	Barton mouths the last line in sync with the offscreen actor:

				MAURY
		...It's early.

	With this the stagehand behind Barton furiously pulls the 
	rope hand-over-hand and we hear thunderous applause and shouts 
	of "Bravo!"  

	As the stagehand finishes bringing the curtain down, somewhat 
	muting the applause, the backstage actor trots out of frame 
	toward the stage.

	The stagehand pulls on an adjacent rope, bringing the curtain 
	back up and unmuting the applause.

	Barton Fink seems dazed. He has been joined by two other 
	men, both dressed in tuxedos, both beaming toward the stage.

	BARTON'S POV

	Looking across a tenement set at the backs of the cast as 
	the curtain rises on the enthusiastic house. The actors take 
	their bows and the cry of "Author, Author" goes up from the 
	crowd.

	The actors turn to smile at Barton in the wings.

	BARTON

	He hesitates, unable to take it all in.

	He is gently nudged toward the stage by the two tuxedoed 
	gentlemen.

	As he exits toward the stage the applause is deafening.

	TRACKING SHOT

	Pushing a maitre 'd who looks back over his shoulder as he 
	leads the way through the restaurant.

				MAITRE 'D
		Your table is ready, Monsieur Fink...  
		several members of your party have 
		already arrived...

	REVERSE

	Pulling Barton

				FINK
		Is Garland Stanford here?

				MAITRE 'D
		He called to say he'd be a few minutes 
		late... Ah, here we are...

	TRACKING IN

	Toward a large semi-circular booth. Three guests, two me and 
	a woman in evening wear, are rising and beaming at Barton. A 
	fat middle-aged man, one of the tuxedoed gentlemen we saw 
	backstage, is moving out to let Barton slide in.

				MAN
		Barton, Barton, so glad you could 
		make it.  You know Richard St. 
		Claire...

	Barton nods and looks at the woman.

				MAN
		...and Poppy Carnahan. We're drinking 
		champagne, dear boy, in honor of the 
		occasion. Have you seen the Herald?

	Barton looks sullenly at his champagne glass as the fat man 
	fills it.

				BARTON
		Not yet.

				MAN
		Well, I don't want to embarrass you 
		but Caven could hardly contain 
		himself. But more important, Richard 
		and Poppy here loved the play.

				POPPY
		Loved it! What power!

				RICHARD
		Yeah, it was a corker.

				BARTON
		Thanks, Richard, but I know for a 
		fact the only fish you've ever seen 
		were tacked to a the wall of the 
		yacht club.

				RICHARD
		Ouch!

				MAN
		Bravo! Nevertheless, we were all 
		devastated.

				POPPY
		Weeping! Copius tears! What did the 
		Herald say?

				MAN
		I happen to have it with me.

				BARTON
		Please Derek 

				POPPY
		Do read it, do!

				DEREK
		"Bare Ruined Choirs: Triumph of the 
		Common Man. The star of the Bare 
		Ruined Choirs was not seen on the 
		stage of the Belasco last night  
		though the thespians involved all 
		acquitted themselves admirably. The 
		find of the evening was the author 
		of this drama about simple folk  
		fish mongers, in fact  whose brute 
		struggle for existence cannot quite 
		quell their longing for something 
		higher. The playwright finds nobility 
		in the most squalid corners and poetry 
		in the most callused speech. A tough 
		new voice in the American theater 
		has arrived, and the owner of that 
		voice is named... Barton Fink."

				BARTON
		They'll be wrapping fish in it in 
		the morning so I guess it's not a 
		total waste.

				POPPY
		Cynic!

				DEREK
		Well we can enjoy your success, 
		Barton, even if you can't.

				BARTON
		Don't get me wrong  I'm glad it'll 
		do well for you, Derek.

				DEREK
		Don't worry about me, dear boy  I 
		want you to celebrate.

				BARTON
		All right, but I can't start listening 
		to the critics, and I can't kid myself 
		about my own work. A writer writes 
		from his gut, and his gut tells him 
		what's good and what's... merely 
		adequate.

				POPPY
		Well I don't pretend to be a critic, 
		but Lord, I have a gut, and it tells 
		me it was simply marvelous.

				RICHARD
		And a charming gut it is.

				POPPY
		You dog!

				RICHARD
			(baying)
		Aaa-woooooooo!

	Barton turns to look for the source of an insistent jingling. 
	We swish pan off him to find a busboy marching through the 
	restaurant displaying a page sign, bell attached, with 
	Barton's name on it.

	TRACKING IN TOWARD A BAR

	A distinguished fifty-year-old gentleman in evening clothes 
	is nursing a martini, watching Barton approach.

	PULLING BARTON

	As he draws near.

				BARTON
		I thought you were going to join us.  
		Jesus, Garland, you left me alone 
		with those people.

				GARLAND
		Don't panic, I'll join you in a 
		minute.  What's you think of Richard 
		and Poppy?

	Barton scowls

				BARTON
		The play was marvelous. She wept, 
		copiously. Millions of dollars and 
		no sense.

	Garland smiles, then draws Barton close.

				GARLAND
		We have to talk a little business. 
		I've just been on the phone to Los 
		Angeles.  Barton, Capitol Pictures 
		wants to put you under contract. 
		They've offered you a thousand dollars 
		a week. I think I can get them to go 
		as high as two.

				BARTON
		To do what?

				GARLAND
		What do you do far a living?

				BARTON
		I'm not sure anymore. I guess I try 
		to make a difference.

				GARLAND
		Fair enough. No pressure here, Barton, 
		because I respect you, but let me 
		point out a couple of things. One, 
		here you make a difference to five 
		hundred fifty people a night  if 
		the show sells out.  Eighty five 
		million people go to the pictures 
		every week.

				BARTON
		To see pap.

				GARLAND
		Yes, generally, to see pap. However, 
		point number two: A brief tenure in 
		Hollywood could support you through 
		the writing of any number of plays.

				BARTON
		I don't know, Garland; my place is 
		here right now. I feel I'm on the 
		brink of success-

				GARLAND
		I'd say you're already enjoying some.

	Barton leans earnestly forward.

				BARTON
		No, Garland, don't you see? Not the 
		kind of success where the critics 
		fawn over you or the producers like 
		Derek make a lot of money. No, a 
		real success  the success we've 
		been dreaming about  the creation 
		of a new, living theater of, about, 
		and for the common man! If I ran off 
		to Hollywood now I'd be making money, 
		going to parties, meeting the big 
		shots, sure, but I'd be cutting myself 
		off from the wellspring of that 
		success, from the common man.

	He leans back and chuckles ruefully.

				BARTON
		...I guess I'm sprouting off again. 
		But I am certain of this, Garland: 
		I'm capable of more good work. Maybe 
		better work than I did in Choirs. It 
		just doesn't seem to me that Los 
		Angeles is the place to lead the 
		life of mind.

				GARLAND
		Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm 
		just the ten percenter. You decide 
		what you want and I'll make it happen. 
		I'm only asking that your decision 
		be informed by a little realism  if 
		I can use that word and Hollywood in 
		the same breath.

	Barton glumly lights a cigarette and gazes out across the 
	floor.

	Garland studies him.

				GARLAND
		...Look, they love you, kid  
		everybody does. You see Caven's review 
		in the Herald?

				BARTON
		No, what did it say?

				GARLAND
		Take my copy. You're the toast of 
		Broadway and you have the opportunity 
		to redeem that for a little cash  
		strike that, a lot of cash.

	Garland looks at Barton for a reaction, but gets none.

				GARLAND
		...The common man'll still be here 
		when you get back. What the hell, 
		they might even have one or two of 
		'em out in Hollywood.

	Absently:

				BARTON
		...That's a rationalization, Garland.

	Garland smiles gently.

				GARLAND
		Barton, it was a joke.

	We hear a distant rumble. It builds slowly and we cut to:

	A GREAT WAVE

	Crushing against the Pacific shore.

	The roar of the surf slips away as we dissolve to:

	HOTEL LOBBY

	A high wide shot from the front door, looking down across 
	wilting potted palms, brass cuspidors turning green, ratty 
	wing chairs; the fading decor is deco-gone-to-seed.

	Amber light, afternoon turning to evening, slopes in from 
	behind us, washing the derelict lobby with golden highlights.  

	Barton Fink enters frame from beneath the camera and stops 
	in the middle foreground to look across the lobby.

	We are framed on his back, his coat and hat. The lobby is 
	empty.  There is a suspended beat as Barton takes it in.  

	Barton moves toward the front desk.

	THE REVERSE

	As Barton stops at the empty desk. He hits a small silver 
	bell next to the register. Its ring-out goes on and on without 
	losing volume.

	After a long beat there is a dull scuffle of shoes on stairs.  
	Barton, puzzled, looks around the empty lobby, then down at 
	the floor behind the front desk.

	A TRAP DOOR

	It swings open and a young man in a faded maroon uniform, 
	holding a shoebrush and a shoe  not one of his own  climbs 
	up from the basement.

	He closes the trap door, steps up to the desk and sticks his 
	finger out to touch the small silver bell, finally muting 
	it.

	The lobby is now silent again.

				CLERK
		Welcome to the Hotel Earle. May I 
		help you, sir?

				BARTON
		I'm checking in. Barton Fink.

	The clerk flips through cards on the desk.

				CLERK
		F-I-N-K. Fink, Barton. That must be 
		you, huh?

				BARTON
		Must be.

				CLERK
		Okay then, everything seems to be in 
		order. Everything seems to be in 
		order.

	He is turning to a register around for Barton to sign.

				CLERK
		...Are you a tranz or a rez?

				BARTON
		Excuse me?

				CLERK
		Transient or resident?

				BARTON
		I don't know... I mean, I'll be here, 
		uh, indefinitely.

				CLERK
		Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a 
		week payable in advance. Checkout 
		time is twelve sharp, only you can 
		forget that on account you're a rez.  
		If you need anything, anything at 
		all, you dial zero on your personal 
		in-room telephone and talk to me. My 
		name is Chet.

				BARTON
		Well, I'm going to be working here, 
		mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do 
		you have room service?

				CLERK
		Kitchen closes at eight but I'm the 
		night clerk. I can always ring out 
		for sandwiches.

	The clerk is scribbling something on the back of an index 
	card.

				CLERK
		...Though we provide privacy for the 
		residential guest, we are also a 
		full service hotel including 
		complimentary shoe shine. My name is 
		Chet.

	He pushes a room key across the counter on top of the index 
	card.

	Barton looks at the card.

	On it: "CHET!" Barton looks back up at the clerk. They regard 
	each other for a beat.

				CLERK
		...Okay

				BARTON
		Huh?

	The clerk.

				CLERK
		Okey-dokey, go ahead.

				BARTON
		What 

				CLERK
		Don't you wanna go to your room?!

	Barton stares at him.

				BARTON
		...What number is it?

	The clerk stares back.

				CLERK
		...Six-oh-five. I forgot to tell 
		you.

	As Barton stoops to pick up his two small bags:

				CLERK
		...Those your only bags?

				BARTON
		The others are being sent.

	The clerk leans over the desk to call after him:

				CLERK
		I'll keep an eye out for them. I'll 
		keep my eyes peeled, Mr. Fink.

	Barton is walking to the elevator.

	ELEVATOR

	Barton enters and sets down his bags.

	An aged man with white stubble, wearing a greasy maroon 
	uniform, sits on a stool facing the call panel. He does not 
	acknowledge Barton's presence.

	After a beat:

				BARTON
		...Six, please.

	The elevator man gets slowly to his feet. As he pushes the 
	door closed:

				ELEVATOR MAN
		Next stop: Six.

	SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY

	Barton walks slowly toward us, examining the numbers on the 
	doors.

	The long, straight hallway is carpeted with an old stained 
	forest green carpet. The wallpaper shows faded yellowing 
	palm trees.  Barton sticks his key in the lock of a door 
	midway down the hall.

	HIS ROOM

	As Barton enters.

	The room is small and cheaply furnished. There is a lumpy 
	bed with a worn yellow coverlet, an old secretary table, and 
	a wooden luggage stand.

	As Barton crosses the room we follow to reveal a sink and 
	wash basin, a house telephone on a rickety night stand, and 
	a window with yellowing sheers looking on an air shaft.  

	Barton throws his valise onto the bed where it sinks, 
	jittering.  He shrugs off his jacket.

	Pips of sweat stand out on Barton's brow. The room is hot.  

	He walks across the room, switches on an oscillating fan and 
	struggles to throw open the window. After he strains at it 
	for a moment, it slides open with a great wrenching sound.  

	Barton picks up his Underwood and places it on the secretary 
	table. He gives the machine a casually affectionate pat.  

	Next to the typewriter are a few sheets of house stationary: 
	"THE HOTEL EARLE: A DAY OR A LIFETIME."

	We pan up to a picture in a cheap wooden frame on the wall 
	above the desk. A bathing beauty sits on the beach under a 
	cobalt blue sky. One hand shields her eyes from the sun as 
	she looks out at a crashing surf.

	The sound of the surf mixes up.

	BARTON

	Looking at the picture

	TRACKING IN ON THE PICTURE

	The surf mixes up louder. We hear a gull cry.

	The sound snaps off with the ring of a telephone.

	THE HOUSE PHONE

	On the nightstand next to the bed. With a groan of bedsprings 
	Barton sits into frame and picks up the telephone.

				VOICE
		How d'ya like your room!

				BARTON
		...Who is this?

				VOICE
		Chet!

				BARTON
		...Who?

				VOICE
		Chet! From downstairs!

	Barton wearily rubs the bridge of his nose.

				VOICE
		...How d'ya like your room!

	A PILLOW

	As Barton's head drops down into frame against it.

	He reaches over and turns off the bedside light.

	He lies back and closes his eyes.

	A long beat.

	We hear a faint hum, growing louder.

	Barton opens his eyes.

	HIS POV

	A naked, peeling ceiling.  The hum  a mosquito, perhaps  
	stops.

	BARTON

	His eyes move this way and that. After a silent beat, he 
	shuts them again.

	After another silent beat, we hear  muffled, probably from 
	am adjacent room  a brief, dying laugh. It is sighing and 
	weary, like the end of a laughing fit, almost a sob.

	Silence again.

	We hear the rising mosquito hum.

								FADE OUT

	EXECUTIVE OFFICE

	Barton Fink is ushered into a large, light office by an 
	obsequious middle- aged man in a sagging suit.

	There are mosquito bites on Barton's face.

	REVERSE

	From behind a huge white desk, a burly man in an expensive 
	suit gets to his feet and strides across the room.

				MAN
		Is that him?! Barton Fink?!  Lemme 
		put my arms around this guy!

	He bear-hugs Barton.

				MAN
		...How the hell are ya? Good trip?

	He separates without waiting for an answer.

				MAN
		My name is Jack Lipnik. I run this 
		dump. You know that  you read the 
		papers.

	Lipnik is lumbering back to his desk.

				MAN
		Lou treating you all right? Got 
		everything you need?  What the hell's 
		the matter with your face? What the 
		hell's the matter with his face, 
		Lou?

				BARTON
		It's not as bad as it looks; just a 
		mosquito in my room 

				LIPNIK
		Place okay?

	To Lou:

				LIPNIK
		...Where did we put him?

				BARTON
		I'm at the Earle.

				LIPNIK
		Never heard of it. Let's move him to 
		the Grand, or the Wilshire, or hell, 
		he can stay at my place.

				BARTON
		Thanks, but I wanted a place that 
		was less...

				LIPNIK
		Less Hollywood?  Sure, say it, it's 
		not a dirty word. Sat whatever the 
		hell you want. The writer is king 
		here at Capitol Pictures. You don't 
		believe me, take a look at your 
		paycheck at the end of every week  
		that's what we think of the writer.
			(to Lou)
		...so what kind of pictures does he 
		like?

				LOU
		Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, 
		Mr.  Lipnik.

				LIPNIK
		How's about it, Bart?

				BARTON
		To be honest, I don't go to the 
		pictures much, Mr. Lipnik 

				LIPNIK
		That's okay, that's okay, that's 
		okay  that's just fine. You probably 
		just walked in here thinking that 
		was going to be a handicap, thinking 
		we wanted people who knew something 
		about the medium, maybe even thinking 
		there was all kind of technical mumbo-
		jumbo to learn. You were dead wrong. 
		We're only interested in one thing: 
		Can you tell a story, Bart?  Can you 
		make us laugh, can you make us cry, 
		can you make us wanna break out in 
		joyous song? Is that more than one 
		thing? Okay.  The point is, I run 
		this dump and I don't know the 
		technical mumbo-jumbo. Why do I run 
		it? I've got horse-sense, goddamnit.  
		Showmanship. And also, and I hope 
		Lou told you this, I bigger and meaner 
		than any other kike in this town. 
		Did you tell him that, Lou? And I 
		don't mean my dick's bigger than 
		yours, it's not a sexual thing  
		although, you're the writer, you 
		would know more about that. Coffee?

				BARTON
		...Yes, thank you.

				LIPNIK
		Lou.

	Lou immediately rises and leaves. Lipnik's tone becomes 
	confidential:

				LIPNIK
		...He used to have shares in the 
		company.  An ownership interest. Got 
		bought out in the twenties  muscled 
		out according to some. Hell, according 
		to me. So we keep him around, he's 
		got a family. Poor schmuck. He's 
		sensitive, don't mention the old 
		days. Oh hell, say whatever you want.  
		Look, barring a preference, Bart, 
		we're gonna put you to work on a 
		wrestling picture. Wallace Beery. I 
		say this because they tell me you 
		know the poetry of the street. That 
		would rule out westerns, pirate 
		pictures, screwball, Bible, Roman...

	He rises and starts pacing.

				LIPNIK
		But look, I'm not one of these guys 
		thinks poetic has gotta be fruity.  
		We're together on that, aren't we? I 
		mean I'm from New York myself  well, 
		Minsk if you wanna go way back, which 
		we won't if you don't mind and I 
		ain't askin'. Now people're gonna 
		tell you, wrestling. Wallace Beery, 
		it's a B picture. You tell them, 
		bullshit. We don't make B pictures 
		here at Capitol.  Let's put a stop 
		to that rumor right now.

	Lou enters with coffee.

				LIPNIK
		...Thanks Lou. Join us. Join us. 
		Talking about the Wallace Beery 
		picture.

				LOU
		Excellent picture.

				LIPNIK
		We got a treatment on it yet?

				LOU
		No, not yet Jack. We just bought the 
		story. Saturday Evening Post.

				LIPNIK
		Okay, the hell with the story. Wallace 
		Beery is a wrestler. I wanna know 
		his hopes, his dreams. Naturally, 
		he'll have to get mixed up with a 
		bad element. And a romantic interest. 
		You know the drill.  Romantic 
		interest, or else a young kid. An 
		orphan. What do you think, Lou?  
		Wally a little too old for a romantic 
		interest?  Look at me, a writer in 
		the room and I'm askin' Lou what the 
		goddamn story should be!

	After a robust laugh, he beams at Barton.

				LIPNIK
		...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? 
		Dame?

				BARTON
		...Both maybe?

	There is a disappointed silence. Lipnik looks at Lou.  Lou 
	clears his throat.

				LOU
		...Maybe we should do a treatment.

				LIPNIK
		Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at 
		it.  He'll get into the swing of 
		things or I don't know writers. Let's 
		make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. 
		We don't gotta tackle the world our 
		first time out. The important thing 
		is we all have that Barton Fink 
		feeling, but since you're Barton 
		Fink I'm assuming you have it in 
		spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. 
		We're off to a good start. Dammit, 
		if all our writers were like you I 
		wouldn't have to get so goddamn 
		involved. I'd like to see something 
		by the end of the week.

	Lou is getting to his feet and signaling for Barton to do 
	likewise.

				LIPNIK
		...Heard about your show, by the 
		way. My man in New York saw it. Tells 
		me it was pretty damn powerful. Pretty 
		damn moving.  A little fruity, he 
		said, but I guess you know what you're 
		doing. Thank you for your heart. We 
		need more heart in pictures.  We're 
		all expecting great things.

	TRACKING SHOT

	We are in the sixth-floor hallway of the Earle, late at night. 
	A pair of shoes sits before each door. Faintly, from one of 
	the rooms, we can hear the clack. clack. clack. of a 
	typewriter.

	It grows louder as we track forward.

	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT  TYPEWRITER

	Close on the typing so that we see only each letter as it is 
	typed, without context.

	One by one the letters clack on: a-u-d-i-b-l-e. After a short 
	beat, a period strikes.

	BARTON

	Elbows on his desk, he looks down at what he has just written. 
	He rolls the paper up a few lines, looks some more.

	THE PAGE

	It says:

								FADE IN:

	A TENEMENT BUILDING

	On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
	audible.

	BARTON

	After a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.

	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT

	The letter-strike area. It is lined up to the last period, 
	which is struck over by a comma. The words "as is" are typed 
	in and we cut back to 

	BARTON

	 as he continues typing. He stops after several more 
	characters and looks.

	Silence.

	Breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. 
	A man's laughter. It is weary, solitary, mirthless.

	Barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.

	HIS POV

	The picture of the girl on the beach.

	BARTON

	Staring, as the end-of-the-tether laughing continues. Barton 
	looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but 
	the sound is too insistent to ignore.

	WIDE SHOT

	The room, Barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall.  

	The laughter.

	Barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and 
	looks out.

	HIS POV

	The empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. At the 
	end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the 
	staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of 
	wall sconces.

	The laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the 
	empty hall.

	Perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because 
	it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for 
	weeping.

	Barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. He slowly 
	withdraws into his room.

	HIS ROOM

	Barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. The 
	laughter/weeping continues.

	He walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house 
	phone.

				BARTON
		Hello... Chet? This is Barton Fink 
		in room 605. Yes, there's uh, there's 
		someone in the room next door to 
		mine, 604, and he's uh... He's uh... 
		making a lot of... noise.

	After a beat:

				BARTON
		...Thank you.

	He cradles the phone. The laughter continues for a moment or 
	two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the 
	telephone ringing next door.

	Barton looks at the wall.

	The muffled sound of a man talking.

	The sound of the earpiece being pronged.

	Muffled footsteps next door.

	The sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting.  

	Footsteps approaching the hall.

	A hard, present knock at Barton's door.

	Barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.

	ON THE DOOR

	As Barton opens it. Standing in the hall is a large man  a 
	very large man  in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened 
	tie. His face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of 
	sweat.

				MAN
		Did you... Somebody just complained...

	Hastily:

				BARTON
		No, I didn't  I mean, I did call 
		down, not to complain exactly, I was 
		just concerned that you might  not 
		that it's my business, but that you 
		might be in some kind of... distress. 
		You see, I was trying to work, and 
		it's, well, it was difficult 

				MAN
		Yeah. I'm damn sorry, if I bothered 
		you.  The damn walls here, well, I 
		just apologize like hell...

	He sticks his hand out.

				MAN
		...My name's Charlie Meadows. I guess 
		we're neighbors...

	Without reaching for the hand.

				BARTON
		Barton Fink.

	Unfazed, Charlie Meadows unpockets a flask.

				CHARLIE
		Neighbor, I'd feel better about the 
		damned inconvenience if you'd let me 
		buy you a drink.

				BARTON
		That's all right, really, thank you.

				CHARLIE
		All right, hell, you trying to work 
		and me carrying on in there. Look, 
		the liquor's good, wuddya say?

	As he enters:

				CHARLIE
		... You got a glass? It's the least 
		I can do.

				BARTON
		Okay... a quick one, sure...

	He gets two glasses from the wash basin.  Charlie sits down 
	on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, 
		all the carryings-on next door.

				BARTON
		That's okay, I assure you. It's just 
		that I was trying to work 

				CHARLIE
		What kind of work do you do, Barton, 
		if you don't mind my asking?

				BARTON
		Well, I'm a writer, actually.

				CHARLIE
		You don't say. That's a tough racket. 
		My hat's off to anyone who can make 
		a go of it. Damned interesting work, 
		I'd imagine.

				BARTON
		Can be. Not easy, but 

				CHARLIE
		Damned difficult, I'd imagine.

	As he hands Charlie a glass:

				BARTON
		And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?

				CHARLIE
		Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, 
		you might say I sell peace of mind. 
		Insurance is my game  door-to-door, 
		human contact, still the only way to 
		move merchandise.

	He fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty 
	glass.

				CHARLIE
		...In spite of what you might think 
		from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.

				BARTON
		Doesn't surprise me at all.

				CHARLIE
		Hell yes. Because I believe in it. 
		Fire, theft, and casualty are not 
		things that only happen to other 
		people  that's what I tell 'em. 
		Writing doesn't work out, you might 
		want to look into it. Providing for 
		basic human need  a fella could do 
		worse.

				BARTON
		Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.

				CHARLIE
		What kind of scribbler are you  
		newspaperman did you say?

				BARTON
		No, I'm actually writing for the 
		pictures now 

				CHARLIE
		Pictures! Jesus!

	He guffaws.

				CHARLIE
		...I'm sorry, brother, I was just 
		sitting here thinking I was talking 
		to some ambitious youngster, eager 
		to make good.  Hell, you've got it 
		made! Writing for pictures! Beating 
		out that competition!  And me being 
		patronizing!

	He gestures toward his face:

				CHARLIE
		...Is the egg showing or what?!

				BARTON
		That's okay; actually I am just 
		starting out in the movies  though 
		I was pretty well established in New 
		York, some renown there,

				CHARLIE
		Oh, it's an exciting time then. I'm 
		not the best-read mug on the planet, 
		so I guess it's no surprise I didn't 
		recognize your name. Jesus, I feel 
		like a heel.

	For the first time Barton smiles.

				BARTON
		That's okay, Charlie. I'm a 
		playwright. My shows've only played 
		New York. Last one got a hell of a 
		write-up in the Herald. I guess that's 
		why they wanted me here.

				CHARLIE
		Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality.  
		What kind of venue, that is to say, 
		thematically, uh...

				BARTON
		What do I write about?

	Charlie laughs.

				CHARLIE
		Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, 
		that's it, Bart.

				BARTON
		Well, that's a good question. Strange 
		as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I 
		write about people like you. The 
		average working stiff. The common 
		man.

				CHARLIE
		Well ain't that a kick in the head!

				BARTON
		Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, 
		that's exactly the point. There's a 
		few people in New York  hopefully 
		our numbers are growing  who feel 
		we have an opportunity now to forge 
		something real out of everyday 
		experience, create a theater for the 
		masses that's based on a few simple 
		truths  not on some shopworn 
		abstractions about drama that doesn't 
		hold true today, if they ever did...

	He gazes at Charlie.

				BARTON
		...I don't guess this means much to 
		you.

				CHARLIE
		Hell, I could tell you some stories

				BARTON
		And that's the point, that we all 
		have stories. The hopes and dreams 
		of the common man are as noble as 
		those of any king. It's the stuff of 
		life  why shouldn't it be the stuff 
		of theater?  Goddamnit, why should 
		that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't 
		call it new theater, Charlie; call 
		it real theater. Call it our theater.

				CHARLIE
		I can see you feel pretty strongly 
		about it.

				BARTON
		Well, I don't mean to get up on my 
		high horse, but why shouldn't we 
		look at ourselves up there?  Who 
		cares about the Fifth Earl of Bastrop 
		and Lady Higginbottom and  and  
		and who killed Nigel Grinch-Gibbons?

				CHARLIE
		I can feel my butt getting sore 
		already.

				BARTON
		Exactly, Charlie! You understand 
		what I'm saying  a lot more than 
		some of these literary types. Because 
		you're a real man!

				CHARLIE
		And I could tell you some stories 

				BARTON
		Sure you could!  And yet many writers 
		do everything in their power to 
		insulate themselves from the common 
		man  from where they live, from 
		where they trade, from where they 
		fight and love and converse and  
		and  and... so naturally their work 
		suffers, and regresses into empty 
		formalism and  well, I'm spouting 
		off again, but to put it in your 
		language, the theater becomes as 
		phony as a three dollar bill.

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right 
		there.

				BARTON
		Frequently played, seldom remarked.

	Charlie laughs.

				CHARLIE
		Whatever that means.

	Barton smiles with him.

				BARTON
		You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad 
		you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well 
		I know I sometimes run on.

				CHARLIE
		Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, 
		I'll let you know if I'm bored. I 
		find it all pretty damned interesting. 
		I'm the kind schmoe who's generally 
		interested in the other guy's point 
		of view.

				BARTON
		Well, we've got something in common 
		then.

	Charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.

				CHARLIE
		Well Christ, if there's any way I 
		can contribute, or help, or whatever

	Barton chuckles and extends his hand.

				BARTON
		Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by 
		just being yourself.

				CHARLIE
		Well, I can tell you some stories 

	He pumps Barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.

				CHARLIE
		...And look, I'm sorry as hell about 
		the interruption. Too much revelry 
		late at night, you forget there are 
		other people in the world.

				BARTON
		See you, Charlie.

	Charlie closes the door and is gone.

	Barton goes back to his desk and sits.

	Muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening 
	and closing.

	Barton looks at the wall.

	HIS POV

	The bathing beauty.

	From offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive-giving-way sound.

				BARTON
		He looks around to the opposite  
		bed  wall.

	HIS POV

	The wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat.  

	One swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from 
	the wall. About three feet of the wall, where it meets the 
	ceiling, is exposed.

	The strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and 
	nods above the bed. It glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical 
	flower.

	BACK TO BARTON

	He goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. He smooths the 
	wallpaper back up against the wall.

	He looks at his hand.

	HIS HAND

	Sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat.

	He wipes it onto his shirt.

	We hear a faint mosquito hum.

	Barton looks around.

								FADE OUT

	A TYPEWRITER Whirring at high speed. The keys strike too 
	quickly for us to make out the words.

	SLOW TRACK IN

	On Barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring 
	blankly.  Distant phones ring. Barton's eyes are tired and 
	bloodshot.

	HIS POV

	A gargoyle secretary sits typing a document.

	The office door opens in the background and a short middle-
	aged man in a dark suit emerges.

	To his secretary:

				EXECUTIVE
		I'm eating on the lot today 

	He notices Barton.

				EXECUTIVE
		...Who's he?

	The secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip 
	of paper on her desk.

				SECRETARY
		Barton Fink, Mr. Geisler.

				GEISLER
		More please.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum 
		said I should drop by morning to see 
		you about the 

				GEISLER
		Ever act?

				BARTON
		...Huh? No, I'm 

				GEISLER
		We need Indians for a Norman Steele 
		western.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer. Ted O 

				GEISLER
		Think about it, Fink. Writers come 
		and go; we always need Indians.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer. Ted Okum said you're 
		producing this Wallace Beery picture 
		I'm working on.

				GEISLER
		What!?  Ted Okum doesn't know shit. 
		They've assigned me enough pictures 
		for a goddamn year. What Ted Okum 
		doesn't know you could almost squeeze 
		into the Hollywood Bowl.

				BARTON
		Then who should I talk to?

	Geisler gives a hostile stare. Without looking at her, he 
	addresses the secretary:

				GEISLER
		Get me Lou Breeze.

	He perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward 
	the secretary, as he glares wordlessly at Barton.

	After a moment:

				SECRETARY
		Is he in for Mr. Geisler?

	She puts the phone in Geisler's hand.

				GEISLER
		Lou? How's Lipnik's ass smell this 
		morning?... Yeah?... Yeah?... Okay, 
		the reason I'm calling, I got a writer 
		here, Fink, all screwy. Says I'm 
		producing that Wallace Beery wrestling 
		picture  what'm I, the goddamn 
		janitor around here?...  Yeah, well 
		who'd you get that from?...  Yeah, 
		well tell Lipnik he can kiss my 
		dimpled ass... Shit! No, alright... 
		No, no, all right.

	Without looking he reaches the phone back. The secretary 
	takes it and cradles it.

				GEISLER
		...Okay kid, let's chow.

	COMMISSARY

	Barton and Geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. Geisler 
	speaks through a mouthful of food:

				GEISLER
		Don't worry about it. It's just a B 
		picture. I bring it in on budget, 
		they'll book it without even screening 
		it. Life is too short.

				BARTON
		But Lipnik said he wanted to look at 
		the script, see something by the end 
		of the week.

				GEISLER
		Sure he did. And he forgot about it 
		before your ass left his sofa.

				BARTON
		Okay. I'm just having trouble getting 
		started. It's funny, I'm blocked up.  
		I feel like I need some kind of 
		indication of... what's expected 

				GEISLER
		Wallace Beery. Wrestling picture. 
		What do you need, a road map?

	Geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at Barton.

				GEISLER
		...Look, you're confused? You need 
		guidance? Talk to another writer.

				BARTON
		Who?

	Geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.

				GEISLER
		Jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll 
		hit one. And do me a favor, Fink: 
		Throw it hard.

	COMMISSARY MEN'S ROOM

	Barton stands at a urinal.

	He stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. After a 
	moment, he cocks his head, listening.

	We hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a 
	difficult passage. It is followed by the gurgling ruch of 
	vomit.

	Barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls.

	There is more businesslike throat clearing.

	Barton stoops.

	HIS POV

	We boom down to show the blue serge pants and well-polished 
	shoes of the stall's kneeling occupant.

	A white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect 
	the trouser knees.

	The toilet flushes. The man rises, picks up his handkerchief 
	up off the floor and gives it a smart flap.

	BARTON

	He quickly straightens and goes to the sink. He starts washing 
	his hands. We hear the stall door being unlatched.

	Barton glances over his shoulder.

	HIS POV

	The stall door opening.

	BARTON

	Quickly, self-consciously, he looks back down at his hands.

	HIS POV

	His hands writhing under the running water. We hear footsteps 
	approaching.

	BARTON

	Forcing himself to look at his hands. We hear the man reach 
	the adjacent sink and turn on the tap.

	Barton can't help glancing up.

	THE MAN

	A dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. He has warm 
	brown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt-and-pepper mustache. 
	He smiles pleasantly at Barton.

	BARTON

	He gives a nervous smile  more like a tic  and looks back 
	down at his hands. We hear the man gargling water and spitting 
	into the sink.

	After a moment, Barton looks up again.

	THE MAN

	Reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, 
	a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.

	BARTON

	Looks back down, then up again.

	THE MAN

	Extends a dripping hand.

				MAN
		Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor.

	His speech is softly accented, from the South.

				BARTON
		Barton Fink.

	They shake, then return to their ablutions.

	We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned 
	off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's 
	eyes are widening.

				BARTON
		...Jesus. W.P.!

	The dapper little man stops and turns.

				MAYHEW
		I beg your pardon?

				BARTON
		W.P. Mayhew? The writer?

				MAYHEW
		Just Bill, please.

	Barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little 
	man, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short 
	pause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but 
	urgent.

				BARTON
		Bill!...

	Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally 
	Barton brings out:

				BARTON
		...You're the finest novelist of our 
		time.

	Mayhew leans against a stall.

				MAYHEW
		Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein' 
		occupied here in the worship of 
		Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet 
		to see your play 

	He smiles at Barton's surprise.

				MAYHEW
		...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the 
		news reaches us in Hollywood.

	He is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.

				BARTON
		Sir, I'm flattered that you even 
		recognize my name. My God, I had no 
		idea you were in Hollywood.

				MAYHEW
		All of us undomesticated writers 
		eventually make their way out here 
		to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's 
		why I allus have such a powerful 
		thrust.

	He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves 
	it at Barton.

				MAYHEW
		...A little social lubricant, Mistuh 
		Fink?

				BARTON
		It's still a little early for me.

				MAYHEW
		So be it.

	He knocks back some more.

				BARTON
		...Bill, if I'm imposing you should 
		say so, I know you're very busy  I 
		just, uh... I just wonder if I could 
		ask you a favor... That is to say, 
		uh... have you ever written a 
		wrestling picture?

	Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.

				MAYHEW
		...You are drippin', suh.

	Barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown 
	paper towel from a dispenser.

	Mayhew sighs:

				MAYHEW
		...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented 
		a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew 
		has not, at one time or othuh, been 
		invited to essay. I have taken my 
		stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I 
		have stabbed at so many others, and 
		with as little success. I gather 
		that you are a fresh-man here, eager 
		for an upperclassman's council.  
		However, just at the moment...

	He waves his flask.

				MAYHEW
		...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't 
		you stop at my bungalow, which is 
		numbah fifteen, later on this 
		afternoon...

	He turns to leave.

				MAYHEW
		...and we will discuss wrastlin' 
		scenarios and other things lit'rary.

	THE NUMBER "15"

	We are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door.  

	Muted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice  enraged, 
	bellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's 
	voice, its tone placating.

	REVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN

	On Barton, standing in front of the door.

	The noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice 
	again.

	Barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks.  

	With this the woman's voice stops, and Mayhew starts wailing 
	again.

	The door cracks open.

	The woman looks as if she has been crying.

				WOMAN
		...Can I help you?

				BARTON
		I'm sorry, I... My name is Fink... 
		Uh, Bill asked me to drop by this 
		afternoon.  Is he in?

				WOMAN
		Mr. Mayhew is indisposed at the 
		moment

	From inside, we hear Mayhew's wail.

				MAYHEW
		HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

	The woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps 
	outside, closing the door behind her.

				WOMAN
		Mr. Fink, I'm Audrey Taylor, Mr. 
		Mayhew's personal secretary. I know 
		this all must sound horrid. I really 
		do apologize...

	Through the door Mayhew is still wailing piteously.

				BARTON
		Is, uh... Is he okay?

				AUDREY
		He will be... When he can't write, 
		he drinks.

				MAYHEW
		WHERE ARE YOU, DAMMIT! WHERE'S 
		M'HONEY!!

	She brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.

				AUDREY
		I am sorry, it's so embarassing.

				BARTON
		How about you? Will you be alright?

				AUDREY
		I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr 
		Fink?

				BARTON
		Yes I am. I'm working on a wres  
		please call me Barton.

	Audrey reaches out and touches Barton's hand.

				AUDREY
		I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm 
		sure he'll want to reschedule your 
		appointment.

				BARTON
		Perhaps you and I could get together 
		at some point also. I'm sorry if 
		that sounds abrupt. I just... I don't 
		know anyone here in this town.

	Audrey smiles at him.

				AUDREY
		Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.

				BARTON
		Please, Barton.

				AUDREY
		Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not 
		just Bill's secretary  Bill and I 
		are... I love. We-

				MAYHEW'S VOICE
		M'HONEY!! WHERE'S M'HONEY!!

	Audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes 
	and heavy footsteps.

				BARTON
		I see.

				AUDREY
		...I know this must look... funny.

				BARTON
		No, no 

	Hurriedly:

				AUDREY
		We need each other. We give each 
		other...  the things we need 

				VOICE
		M'HONEY!!... bastard-ass sons of 
		bitches... the water's lappin' up...
		M'HONEY!!

				AUDREY
		I'm sorry, Mr. Fink. Please don't 
		judge us. Please...

	Flustered, she backs away and closes the door.

	CLOSE ON A SMALL WRAPPED PACKAGE

	Hand-printed on the package is the message:

	"Hope these will turn the trick, Mr. Fink.  Chet!"  

	The wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened.

	Two thumbtacks are taken out.

	BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM

	Late at night. The swath of wallpaper behind the bed has 
	sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the 
	swath next to it.

	Barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed.

	He smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near 
	the top.

	EXTREME CLOSE SHOT

	On the tack. As Barton applies pressure to push it in, tacky 
	yellow goo oozes out of the puncture hole and beads around 
	the tack.

	ON BARTON

	Smoothing up the second swath.

	As he pushes in the second tack he pauses, listening.  

	Muffled, through the wall, we can hear a woman moaning.  

	After a motionless beat, Barton eases his ear against the 
	wall.

	CLOSE ON BARTON

	As his ear meets the wall.

	The woman's moaning continues. We hear the creaking of 
	bedsprings and her partner, incongruously giggling.

	Barton grimaces, gets down off the bed and crosses to the 
	secretary, where he sits. He stares at the paper in the 
	carriage.

	HIS POV

	The blank part of the page around the key-strike area, under 
	the metal prongs that hold the paper down.

	We begin to hear moaning again.

	BACK TO BARTON

	Still looking; sweating.

	HIS POV

	Tracking in on the paper, losing the prongs from frame so 
	that we are looking at the pure unblemished white of the 
	page.

	The moaning is cut short by two sharp knocks.

	THE DOOR

	As it swings open.  Charlie Meadows leans in, smiling.

				CHARLIE
		Howdy, neighbor.

				BARTON
		Charlie. How are you.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, I hope I'm not interrupting 
		you again. I heard you walking around 
		in here.  Figured I'd drop by.

				BARTON
		Yeah, come in Charlie. Hadn't really 
		gotten started yet  what happened 
		to your ear?

	 for Charle's left ear is plugged with cotton wadding. As 
	he enters:

				CHARLIE
		Oh, yeah. An ear infection, chronic 
		thing.  Goes away for a while, but 
		it always comes back. Gotta put cotton 
		in it to staunch the flow of pus. 
		Don't worry, it's not contagious.

				BARTON
		Seen a doctor?

	Charlie gives a dismissive wave.

				CHARLIE
		Ah, doctors. What's he gonna tell 
		me?  Can't trade my head in for a 
		new one.

				BARTON
		No, I guess you're stuck with the 
		one you've got. Have a seat.

	Charlie perches on the corner of the bed.

				CHARLIE
		Thanks, I'd invite you over to my 
		place, but it's a goddamn mess. You 
		married, Bart?

				BARTON
		Nope.

				CHARLIE
		I myself have yet to be lassoed.

	He takes his flask out.

				CHARLIE
		...Got a sweetheart?

				BARTON
		No... I guess it's something about 
		my work. I get so worked up over it, 
		I don't know; I don't really have a 
		lot of attention left over, so it 
		would be a little unfair...

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. 
		In my experience, they pretend to 
		give it, but it's generally a smoke-
		screen for demanding it back  with 
		interest. How about family, Bart?  
		How're you fixed in that department?

	Barton smiles.

				BARTON
		My folks live in Brooklyn, with my 
		uncle.

				CHARLIE
		Mine have passed on. It's just the 
		three of us now...

	He taps himself on the head, chuckling.

				CHARLIE
		...What's the expression  me myself 
		and I.

				BARTON
		Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, 
		we're all alone in this world aren't 
		we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by 
		family and friends, but...

	He shrugs.

				CHARLIE
		Mm... You're no stranger to 
		loneliness, then. I guess I got no 
		beef; especially where the dames are 
		concerned. In my line of work I get 
		opportunities galore  always on the 
		wing, you know what I'm saying. I 
		could tell stories to curl your hair 
		 but it looks like you've already 
		heard 'em!

	He laughs at his reference to Barton's curly hair, and pulls 
	a dog-eared photograph from his wallet. As he hands it to 
	Barton:

				CHARLIE
		...That's me in Kansas City, plying 
		my trade.

	THE PHOTO

	Charlie smiles and waves with one foot up on the running 
	board of a 1939 roadster. A battered leather briefcase dangles 
	from one hand.

				CHARLIE
		...It was taken by one of my policy 
		holders. They're more than just 
		customers to me, Barton.  They really 
		appreciate what I have to offer them. 
		Ya see, her hubby was out of town at 
		the time 

				BARTON
		You know, in a way, I envy you 
		Charlie.  Your daily routine  you 
		know what's expected. You know the 
		drill. My job is to plumb the depths, 
		so to speak, dredge something up 
		from inside, something honest. There's 
		no road map for that territory...

	He looks from Charlie to the Underwood.

				BARTON
		...and exploring it can be painful. 
		The kind of pain most people don't 
		know anything about.

	He looks back at Charlie.

				BARTON
		...This must be boring you.

				CHARLIE
		Not at all. It's damned interesting.

				BARTON
		Yeah...

	He gives a sad chuckle.

				BARTON
		...Probably sounds a little grand 
		coming from someone who's writing a 
		wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.

				CHARLIE
		Beery! You got no beef there! He's 
		good.  Hell of an actor  though, 
		for my money, you can't beat Jack 
		Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, 
		funny stuff. But don't get me wrong 
		 Beery, a wrestling picture, that 
		could be a pip. Wrestled some myself 
		back in school. I guess you know the 
		basic moves.

				BARTON
		Nope, never watched any. I'm not 
		that interested in the act itself 

				CHARLIE
		Okay, but hell, you should know what 
		it is. I can show you in about thirty 
		seconds.

	He is getting down on his hands and knees.

				CHARLIE
		...You're a little out of your weight 
		class, but just for purposes of 
		demonstration 

				BARTON
		That's all right, really 

				CHARLIE
		Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest 
		thing in the world! You just get 
		down on your knees to my left, slap 
		your right hand here...

	He indicated his own right bicep.

				CHARLIE
		...and your left hand here.

	He indicated his left bicep.

	Barton hesitates.

				CHARLIE
		...You can do it, champ!

	Barton complies.

				CHARLIE
		...All right now, when I say "Ready...  
		wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I 
		try and pin you. That's the whole 
		game. Got it?

				BARTON
		...Yeah, okay.

				CHARLIE
		Ready... wrestle!

	With one clean move Charlie flips Barton onto his back, his 
	head and shoulders hitting with a thump. Charlie pins Barton's 
	shoulders with his own upper body.

	But before the move even seems completed Charlie is standing 
	again, offering his hand down to Barton.

				CHARLIE
		Damn, there I go again. We're gonna 
		wake the downstairs neighbors.  I 
		didn't hurt ya, did I?

	Barton seems dazed, but not put out.

				BARTON
		It's okay, it's okay.

				CHARLIE
		Well, that's all that wrestling is. 
		Except usually there's more grunting 
		and squirming before the pin. Well, 
		it's your first time. And you're out 
		of your weight class.

	Barton has propped himself up and is painfully massaging the 
	back of his head. This registers on Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus, I did hurt you!

	He clomps hurriedly away.

				CHARLIE
		...I'm just a big, clumsy lug. I 
		sure do apologize.

	We hear water running, and Charlie reenters with a wet towel.  

	Barton accepts the towel and presses it to his head.

				CHARLIE
		...You sure you're okay?

	Barton gets to his feet.

				BARTON
		I'm fine, Charlie. Really I am. 
		Actually, it's been helpful, but I 
		guess I should get back to work.

	Charlie looks at him with some concern, then turns and heads 
	for the door.

				CHARLIE
		Well, it wasn't fair of me to do 
		that. I'm pretty well endowed 
		physically.

	He opens the door.

				CHARLIE
		...Don't feel bad, though. I wouldn't 
		be much of a match for you at mental 
		gymnastics. Gimme a holler if you 
		need anything.

	The door closes.

	Barton crosses to the secretary and sits down, rubbing the 
	back of his head. He rolls up the carriage and looks at the 
	page in the typewriter.

	HIS POV

	The page.

								FADE IN:

	A TENEMENT BUILDING

	On Manhattan's Lower East Side. Early morning traffic is 
	audible, as is the cry fishmongers.

	BACK TO BARTON

	He rubs the back of his head, wincing, as he stares at the 
	page.

	His gaze drifts up.

	HIS POV

	The bathing beauty.

	BARTON

	Looking at the picture. He presses the heels of his hands 
	against his ears.

	HIS POV

	The bathing beauty. Faint, but building, is the sound of the 
	surf.

	BARTON

	Head cocked. The surf is mixing into another liquid sound.  
	Barton looks sharply around.

	THE BATHROOM

	Barton enters.

	The sink, which Charlie apparently left running when he wet 
	Barton's towel, is overflowing. Water spills onto the tile 
	floor.

	Barton hurriedly shuts off the tap, rolls up one sleeve and 
	reaches into the sink.

	As his hand emerges, holding something, we hear the unclogged 
	sink gulp water.

	BARTON'S HAND

	Holding a dripping wad of cotton.

	BARTON

	After a brief, puzzled look he realizes where the cotton 
	came from  and convulsively flips it away.

								FADE OUT

								FADE IN:

	ON THE TITLE PAGE OF A BOOK:

	"NEBUCHADNEZZAR  
	BY  
	W.P. Mayhew"

	A hand enters with pen to inscribe: "To Barton 

	May this little entertainment divert you in your sojourn 
	among the Philistines.   Bill"

	The book is closed and picked up.

	WIDER

	As-thoomp!-the heavy volume is deposited across the table, 
	in front of Barton, by Mayhew.

	Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are seated around a picnic table. 
	It is one of a few tables littering the lot of a small stucco 
	open-air hamburger stand.

	It is peaceful early evening. The last of the sunlight slopes 
	down through palm trees. Barton, Mayhew, and Audrey are the 
	only customers at the stand.

	Mayhew's black Ford stands alone at the edge of the lot.  

	Mayhew leans back in his chair.

				MAYHEW
		If I close m'eyes I can almost smell 
		the live oak.

				AUDREY
		That's hamburger grease, Bill.

				MAYHEW
		Well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish 
		on me  lyin' and deceitful...

	His eyes still closed, he waves a limp hand gently in the 
	breeze.

				MAYHEW
		...Still, I must say. I haven't felt 
		peace like this since the grand 
		productive days. Don't you find it 
		so, Barton? Ain't writin' peace?

				BARTON
		Well... actually, no Bill...

	Barton looks nervously at Audrey before continuing.

				BARTON
		...No, I've always found that writing 
		comes from a great inner pain. Maybe 
		it's a pain that comes from a 
		realization that one must do something 
		for one's fellow man  to help somehow 
		to ease his suffering.  Maybe it's a 
		personal pain. At any rate, I don't 
		believe good work is possible without 
		it.

				MAYHEW
		Mmm. Wal, me, I just enjoy maikn' 
		things up. Yessir. Escape... It's 
		when I can't write, can't escape 
		m'self, that I want to tear m'head 
		off and run screamin' down the street 
		with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. 
		Mm...

	He sighs and reaches for a bottle of Wild Turkey.

				MAYHEW
		...This'll sometimes help.

				AUDREY
		That doesn't help anything, Bill.

				BARTON
		That's true, Bill. I've never found 
		it to help my writing.

	Mayhew is becoming testy:

				MAYHEW
		Your writing? Son, have you ever 
		heard the story of Soloman's mammy-

	Audrey, anticipating, jumps hastily in. She taps the book on 
	the table.

				AUDREY
		You should read this, Barton. I think 
		it's Bill's finest, or among his 
		finest anyway.

	Mayhew looks at her narrowly.

				MAYHEW
		So now I'm s'posed to roll over like 
		an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly 
		scratched.

				AUDREY
		Bill 

				BARTON
		Look, maybe it's none of my business, 
		but a man with your talent  don't 
		you think your first obligation would 
		be to your gift? Shouldn't you be 
		doing whatever you have to do to 
		work again?

				MAYHEW
		And what would that be, son?

				BARTON
		I don't know exactly. But I do know 
		what you're doing with that drink. 
		You're cutting yourself off from 
		your gift, and from me and Audrey, 
		and from your fellow man, and from 
		everything your art is about.

				MAYHEW
		No son, thisahere moonshine's got 
		nothin' to do with shuttin' folks 
		out. No, I'm usin' it to build 
		somethin'.

				BARTON
		What's that?

				MAYHEW
		I'm buildin' a levee. Gulp by gulp, 
		brick by brick. Raisin' up a levee 
		to keep that ragin' river of manure 
		from lappin' at m'door.

				AUDREY
		Maybe you better too, Barton. Before 
		you get buried under his manure.

	Mayhew chuckles.

				MAYHEW
		M'honey pretends to be impatient 
		with me, Barton, but she'll put up 
		with anything.

				AUDREY
		Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.

				BARTON
		You're lucky she puts up with as 
		much as she does.

	Mayhew is getting to his feet.

				MAYHEW
		Am I? Maybe to a schoolboy's eye. 
		People who know about the human heart, 
		though, mebbe they'd say, Bill over 
		here, he gives his honey love, and 
		she pays him back with pity  the 
		basest coin there is.

				AUDREY
		Stop it, Bill!

	He wanders over to a corner of the lot between two palm trees, 
	still clutching his bottle, his back to Barton and Audrey, 
	and urinates into the grass.

	He is singing  loudly  "Old Black Joe."

	Audrey walks over to him.

	BARTON

	Watching her go.

	HIS POV

	Audrey touches Mayhew's elbow. He looks at her, stops singing, 
	she murmurs something, and he bellows:

				MAYHEW
		The truth, m'honey, is a tart that 
		does not bear scrutiny.

	She touches him again, murmuring, and he lashes out at her, 
	knocking her to the ground.

				MAYHEW
		Breach my levee at your peril!

	BARTON

	He rises.

	AUDREY

	Coming back to Barton.

	MAYHEW

	Stumbling off down the dusty road, muttering to himself and 
	waving his bottle of Wild Turkey.

				AUDREY
		Let him go.

				BARTON
		That son of a bitch... Don't get me 
		wrong, he's a fine writer.

	He looks down the road. Mayhew is a small lone figure, weaving 
	in the dust.

				MAYHEW
		I'll jus' walk on down to the Pacific, 
		and from there I'll... improvise.

				BARTON
		Are you all right?

	We hear distant bellowing:

				MAYHEW
		Silent upon a hill in Darien!

	Audrey bursts into tears. Barton puts his arms around her 
	and she leans into him.

				BARTON
		Audrey, you can't put up with this.

	Gradually, she collects herself, wiping her tears.

				AUDREY
		...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for 
		him!

				BARTON
		What?! He's a son of a bitch!

				AUDREY
		No, sometimes he just... well, he 
		thinks about Estelle. His wife still 
		lives in Fayettesville. She's... 
		disturbed.

				BARTON
		Really?...

	He considers this for a moment, but his anger returns.

				BARTON
		...Well that doesn't excuse his 
		behavior.

				AUDREY
		He'll wander back when he's sober 
		and apologize. He always does.

				BARTON
		Okay, but that doesn't excuse his 

				AUDREY
		Barton. Empathy requires... 
		understanding.

				BARTON
		What. What don't I understand?

	Audrey gazes at him.

	MAYHEW

	He is very distant now, weaving but somehow dignified in his 
	light summer suit. "Old Black Joe" floats back to us in the 
	twilight.

								FADE OUT

	BARTON'S HOTEL ROOM

	From a high angle, booming down on Barton.

	The room is dark. Barton lies fully clothed, stretched out 
	on the bed, asleep. The hum of the mosquito fades up in the 
	stillness.

	Suddenly Barton slaps his cheek. His eyes open, but he remains 
	still. The hum fades up again.  Barton reaches over and turns 
	on the bedside lamp. His eyes shift this way and that as he 
	waits, listening.

	The hum fades down to silence.

	Barton's eyes shift.

	HIS POV

	The typewriter sits on the secretary, a piece of paper rolled 
	halfway through the carriage.

	THE TYPEWRITER

	Barton enters frame and sits down in front of the typewriter.

	HIS POV

	Next to the typewriter are several crumpled pieces of paper.  
	The page in the carriage reads:

								FADE IN:

	A TENEMENT HOTEL

	On the Lower East Side. We can faintly hear the cry of the 
	fishmongers. It is too early for us to hear traffic; later, 
	perhaps, we will.

	BACK TO BARTON

	Looking down at the page.

	CLOSE ON BARTON'S FEET

	Swinging in the legwell.

	One foot idly swings over to nudge a pair of nicely shined 
	shoes from where they rest, under the secretary, into the 
	legwell.

	We hear typing start.

	THE PAGE

	A new paragraph being started: "A large man..."

	BARTON'S FEET

	As he slides them into the shoes.

	THE PAGE

	"A large man in tights..."

	The typing stops.

	BARTON

	Looking quizzically at the page. What's wrong?

	HIS FEET

	Sliding back and forth  swimming  in his shoes, which are 
	several sizes too large.

	We hear a knock at the door.

	BARTON

	He rises and answers the door.

	Charlie stands smiling in the doorway, holding a pair of 
	nicely shined shoes.

				CHARLIE
		I hope these are your shoes.

				BARTON
		Hi, Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		Because that would mean they gave 
		you mine.

				BARTON
		Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. 
		Come on in.

	The two stocking-footed men go into the room and Barton 
	reaches under the secretary for Charlie's shoes.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had 
		one of those days?

				BARTON
		Seems like nothing but, lately.

	Chalrie perches on the edge of the bed.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, what a day. Felt like I 
		couldn't've sold ice water in the 
		Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't 
		want insurance, so okay, that's your 
		loss. But God, people can be rude. 
		Feel like I have to talk to a normal 
		person like just to restore a little 
		of my...

				BARTON
		Well, my pleasure. I could use a 
		little lift myself.

				CHARLIE
		A little lift, yeah...

	Smiling, he takes out his flask.

				CHARLIE
		...Good thing they bottle it, huh 
		pal?

	He takes a glass from the bedstand and, as he pours Barton a 
	shot:

				CHARLIE
		...Did I say rude? People can be 
		goddamn cruel. Especially some of 
		their housewives. Okay, so I've got 
		a weight problem. That's my cross to 
		bear. I dunno...

				BARTON
		Well it's... it's a defense mechanism.

				CHARLIE
		Defense against what? Insurance?  
		Something they need? Something they 
		should be thanking me for offering? 
		A little peace of mind?...

	He shakes his head.

				CHARLIE
		...Finally decided to knock off early, 
		take your advice. Went to see a doctor 
		about this.

	He indicates his ear, still stuffed with cotton.

				CHARLIE
		...He told me it was an ear infection.  
		Ten dollars, please. I said, hell, I 
		told YOU my ear was infected. Why 
		don't YOU give ME ten dollars? Well, 
		THAT led to an argument...

	He gives a rueful chuckle.

				CHARLIE
		...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if 
		my problems amounted to a hill of 
		beans. How goes the life of the mind?

				BARTON
		Well, it's been better. I can't seem 
		to get going on this thing. That one 
		idea, the one that lets you get 
		started  I still haven't gotten it.  
		Maybe I only had one idea in me  my 
		play. Maybe once that was done, I 
		was done being a writer.  Christ, I 
		feel like a fraud, sitting here 
		staring at this paper.

				CHARLIE
		Those two love-birds next door drivin' 
		you nuts?

	Barton looks at him curiously.

				BARTON
		How did you know about that?

				CHARLIE
		Know about it? I can practically see 
		how they're doin' it. Brother, I 
		wish I had a piece of that.

				BARTON
		Yeah, but 

				CHARLIE
		Seems like I hear everything that 
		goes on in this dump. Pipes or 
		somethin'. I'm just glad I don't 
		have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee 
		hours.

	He laughs.

				CHARLIE
		...Ah, you'll lick this picture 
		business, believe me. You've got a 
		head on your shoulders. What is it 
		they say? Where there's a head, 
		there's a hope?

				BARTON
		Where there's life there's hope.

	Charlie laughs.

				CHARLIE
		That proves you really are a writer!

	Barton smiles.

				BARTON
		And there's hope for you too, Charlie.  
		Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen 
		policies.

				CHARLIE
		Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I 
		gotta pull up stakes temporarily.

				BARTON
		You're leaving?

				CHARLIE
		In a few days. Out to your stompin' 
		grounds as a matter of fact  New 
		York City. Things have gotten all 
		balled up at the Head Office.

				BARTON
		I'm truly sorry to hear that, Charlie.  
		I'll miss you.

				CHARLIE
		Well hell, buddy, don't pull a long 
		face!  This is still home for me  I 
		keep my room, and I'll be back sooner 
		or later...

	Barton rises and walks over to his writing table.

				CHARLIE
		...And  mark my words  by the time 
		I get back you're picture'll be 
		finished. I know it.

	Barton scribbles on a notepad and turns to hand it to Charlie.

				BARTON
		New York can be pretty cruel to 
		strangers, Charlie. If you need a 
		home-cooked meal you just look up 
		Morris and Lillian Fink.  They live 
		on Fulton Street with my uncle Dave.

	We hear a tacky, tearing sound.

	Barton looks toward the door.

	Charlie rises and walks over to the stand next to where Barton 
	sits.

	The two staring men form an odd, motionless tableau  the 
	slight, bespectacled man seated; the big man standing in a 
	hunch with his hands on his thighs; their heads close 
	together.

	THEIR POV

	A swath of wallpaper in the entryway has pulled away from 
	the wall. It sags and nods.

				CHARLIE
			(off)
		Christ!

	THE TWO MEN

	Frozen, looking.

				CHARLIE
		...Your room does that too?

				BARTON
		I guess the heat's sweating off the 
		wallpaper.

				CHARLIE
		What a dump...

	He heads for the door and Barton follows.

				CHARLIE
		...I guess it seems pathetic to a 
		guy like you.

				BARTON
		Well...

				CHARLIE
		Well it's pathetic, isn't it? I mean 
		to a guy from New York.

				BARTON
		What do you mean?

				CHARLIE
		This kind of heat. It's pathetic.

				BARTON
		Well, I guess you pick your poison.

				CHARLIE
		So they say.

				BARTON
		Don't pick up and leave without saying 
		goodbye.

				CHARLIE
		Course not, compadre. You'll see me 
		again.

	Barton closes the door.

	He goes back to the desk, sits, and stares at the typewriter.  
	After a beat he tips back in his chair and looks up at the 
	ceiling.

	We hear a loud thump.

	HIS POV

	The ceiling  a white, seamless space.

	As we track in the thumping continues  slowly, rhythmically, 
	progressively louder  the effect, it seems, of odd doings 
	upstairs.

	LOOKING DOWN ON BARTON

	From a high angle, tipped back in his chair, staring at the 
	ceiling.

	We track slowly down toward him. The thumping continues, 
	growing louder, sharper.

	HIS POV

	Moving in on the ceiling. We close in on an unblemished area 
	and cease to have any sense of movement.

	With a blur something huge and dark sweeps across the frame 
	to land with a deafening crash, and an instant later it is 
	gone, having left a huge black "T" stamped into the white 
	ceiling.

	We are pulling back from the white, past the metal prongs of 
	the key-strike area on a typewriter. More letters appear 
	rapid-fire, growing smaller as the pull back continues. The 
	thumpimg becomes the clacking of the typewriter.

	BEN GEISLER

	Is emerging from his office.  As he enters the secretary 
	stops typing, glances down at a slip of paper, and murmurs 
	tonelessly, without looking up:

				SECRETARY
		Barton Fink.

				GEISLER
		Yeah. Fink. Come in.

	The clack of the typewriter resumes as Barton rises.

	GEISLER'S OFFICE

	The two men enter.

	This office is considerably smaller than Lipnik's, done in 
	grays and black. There are pictures on the wall of Geisler 
	with various celebrities.

	Geisler sits behind his desk.

				GEISLER
		Wuddya got for me  what the hell 
		happened to your face?

				BARTON
		Nothing. It's just a mosquito bite.

				GEISLER
		Like hell it is; there are no 
		mosquitos in Los Angeles. Mosquitos 
		breed in swamps  this is a desert 
		town. Wuddya got for me?

				BARTON
		Well I...

				GEISLER
		On the Beery picture! Where are we? 
		Wuddya got?

				BARTON
		Well, to tell you the truth, I'm 
		having some trouble getting started

				GEISLER
		Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! 
		Started?!  You mean you don't have 
		ANYthing?!

				BARTON
		Well not much.

	Geisler leaps to his feet and paces.

				GEISLER
		What do you think this is? HAMLET? 
		GONE WITH THE WIND? RUGGLES OF RED 
		GAP? It's a goddamn B picture! Big 
		men in tights! You know the drill!

				BARTON
		I'm afraid I don't really understand 
		that genre. maybe that's the prob-

				GEISLER
		Understand shit! I though you were 
		gonna consult another writer on this!

				BARTON
		Well, I've talked to Bill Mayhew-

				GEISLER
		Bill Mayhew! Some help! The guy's a 
		souse!

				BARTON
		He's a great writer 

				GEISLER
		A souse!

				BARTON
		You don't understand. He's in pain,
		because he can't write-

				GEISLER
		Souse! Souse! He manages to write 
		his name on the back of his paycheck 
		every week!

				BARTON
		But... I thought no one cared about 
		this picture.

				GEISLER
		You thought! Where'd you get THAT 
		from?  You thought! I don't know 
		what the hell you said to Lipnik, 
		but the sonofabitch LIKES you! You 
		understand that, Fink? He LIKES you! 
		He's taken an interest. NEVER make 
		Lipnik like you. NEVER!

	Some puzzlement shows through Barton's weariness.

				BARTON
		I don't understand-

				GEISLER
		Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's 
		taken an interest! What the hell did 
		you say to him?

				BARTON
		I didn't say anything-

				GEISLER
		Well he's taken an interest!  That 
		means he'll make your life hell, 
		which I could care less about, but 
		since I drew the short straw to 
		supervise this turkey, he's gonna be 
		all over me too! Fat-assed sonofabitch 
		called me yesterday to ask how it's 
		going  don't worry, I covered for 
		you. Told him you were making progress 
		and we were all very excited. I told 
		him it was great, so now MY ass is 
		on the line.  He wants you to tell 
		him all about it tomorrow.

				BARTON
		I can't write anything by tomorrow.

				GEISLER
		Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't 
		read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell 
		him SOMEthing for Chrissake.

				BARTON
		Well what do I tell him?

	Geisler rubs a temple, studies Barton for a beat, then picks 
	up a telephone.

				GEISLER
		Projection...

	As he waits, Geisler gives Barton a withering stare. It 
	continues throughout the phone conversation.

				GEISLER
		... Jerry? Ben Geisler here. Any of 
		the screening rooms free this 
		afternoon?...  Good, book it for me. 
		A writer named Fink is gonna come in 
		and you're gonna show him wrestling 
		pictures... I don't give a shit which 
		ones! WRESTLING pictures!  Wait a 
		minute- isn't Victor Sjoderberg 
		shooting one now?... Show him some 
		of the dailies on that.

	He slams down the phone.

				GEISLER
		...This ought to give you some ideas.

	He jots an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Barton.

				GEISLER
		...Eight-fifteen tomorrow morning at 
		Lipnik's house. Ideas. Broad strokes.  
		Don't cross me, Fink.

	SCREEN

	Black-and-white footage. A middle-aged man with a clapstick 
	enters and shouts:

				CLAPPER
		DEVIL ON THE CANVAS, twelve baker 
		take one.

	Clap! The clapper withdraws. The angle is on a corner of the 
	ring, where an old corner man stands behind his charge, a 
	huge man in tights who is a little too flabby to be a real 
	athlete. His hair is plastered against his bullet skull and 
	he has a small mustache.

				VOICE
		Action.

	The wrestler rises from his stool and heads toward center 
	ring and the camera. He affects a German accent:

				WRESTLER
		I will destroy him!

	He passes the camera.

				VOICE
		Cut.

	Flash frames.

	The clapper enters again.

				CLAPPER
		Twelve baker take two.

	Clap! He exits.

	The wrestler moves toward the camera.

				WRESTLER
		I will destroy him!

				VOICE
		Cut.

	The clapper enters

				CLAPPER
		Twelve baker take three.

	Clap!

				WRESTLER
		I will destroy him!

	SLOW TRACK IN ON BARTON

	Seated alone in a dark screening room, the shaft of the 
	projection beam flickering over his left shoulder.

	As we creep in closer:

				WRESTLER
			(off)
		I will destroy him!... I will destroy 
		him!... I will destroy him!... I 
		will destroy him!...

	Another off-microphone, distant voice from the screen:

				VOICE
		Okay, take five...

	THE SCREEN

	A jerky pan, interrupted by flash frames. The wrestler is 
	standing in a corner joking with a makeup girl who pats down 
	his face as he smokes a cigarette.

	A cut in the film and another clapstick enters.

				CLAPPER
		Twelve charlie take one-

	ON THE CLAP:

	BACK TO BARTON

	Staring at the screen, dull, wan, and forlorn.

				VOICE
			(off)
		Action.

	THE SCREEN

	The angle is low  canvas level. We hold for a brief moment 
	on the empty canvas before two wrestlers crash down into 
	frame.

	The German is underneath, on his back, pinned by the other 
	man.

	The referee enters, cropped at the knees, and throws counting 
	fingers down into frame.

				REFEREE
		One... two...

				WRESTLER
		AAAAHHHH!!

	The German bucks and throws his opponent out of frame.

				VOICE
		Cut.

				CLAPPER
		Twelve charlie take two.

	Crash.

				REFEREE
		One... two...

				WRESTLER
		AAAAHHHH!!

	BARTON

	Glazed.

				WRESTLER
			(off)
		AAAAAAHHHHHH!!... AAAAAAHHHHHH!!...  
		AAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!...

	PAGE IN TYPEWRITER

	The screaming drops out abruptly at cut. We hear only the 
	sound of heavy footfalls on carpet.

	Below the opening paragraph, two new words have been added 
	to the typescript:

	"Orphan?"

	"Dame?"  

	The foot falls continue.

	THE HOTEL ROOM

	Night. Barton paces frantically back and forth.

	He looks at his watch.

	HIS POV

	It is 12:30.

	CLOSE ON THE PHONE

	It is lifted out of the cradle.

				BARTON
		Hello, Chet, it's Barton Fink in 
		605. Can you try a number for me in 
		Hollywood...  Slausen 6-4304.

	We pull back to frame in Barton as we hear his call ring 
	through.  Barton sweats.

				BARTON
		Pick it up... Pick it up. Pick it-

				AUDREY
		Hello.

				BARTON
		Audrey, listen, I need help. I know 
		it's late and I shouldn't be calling 
		you like this  believe me I wouldn't 
		have if I could see any other 
		alternative, but I  I'm sorry -
		listen, how are you  I'm sorry. You 
		doing okay?

				AUDREY
		...Who is this?

				BARTON
		Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.

	Through the phone, in the background, we hear Mayhew's drunken 
	bellowing.

				MAYHEW
		Sons of bitches! Drown 'em all!

	We hear various objects dropping or being thrown to the floor.

				AUDREY
		Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good 
		time-

				MAYHEW
		Drown all those rascals...

				BARTON
		I'm sorry, I just feel like I know 
		I shouldn't ask, I just need some 
		kind of help, I just, I have a 
		deadline tomorrow-

				MAYHEW
		I said drown 'em all! Who is that?

	There is more clatter.

	Audrey's voice is hushed, close to the phone:

				AUDREY
		All right Barton, I'll see if I can 
		slip away-

				MAYHEW
		Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come 
		into the house... sons of bitches...

				BARTON
		If you could, I'd 

				AUDREY
		If I can. He gets jealous; he-

				MAYHEW
		Goddamn voices... DROWN 'EM!

				BARTON
		I need help, Audrey.

				AUDREY
		I'll try to slip out. If he quiets 
		down, passes out... I'm afraid he 
		thinks  well, he said you were a 
		buffoon, Barton. He becomes 
		irrational

				MAYHEW
		Hesh up! Be still now! DROWN 'EM!  
		DROWN 'EM! DROWN 

	WIDE ON THE ROOM

	Later. It is quiet. We are craning down toward the bed, where 
	Barton lies stretched out, his head buried beneath a pillow 
	as if to blot out the world.

	The track reveals the wristwatch on Barton's dangled arm: 
	1:30.

	THE HALLWAY

	At the end of the dimly lit corridor a red light blinks on 
	over the elevator, with a faint bell.

	BACK TO BARTON

	With two violent and simultaneous motions he whips the pillow 
	off his head and throws out his other wrist to look at his 
	watch.

	There is a knock at the door.

	Barton swings his feet off the bed.

	THE DOORWAY

	Barton opens the door to Audrey.

				AUDREY
		Hello, Barton.

				BARTON
		Audrey, thank you for coming. Thank 
		you.  I'm sorry to be such a... such 
		a... Thank you.

	They enter the main room, where Audrey perches on the edge 
	of the bed.

				AUDREY
		Now that's all right, Barton.  
		Everything'll be all right.

				BARTON
		Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?

				AUDREY
		Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll 
		sleep for a while now. What is it 
		you have to do, exactly?

	Barton paces.

				BARTON
		Well I have to come up with  an 
		outline, I'd guess you call it. The 
		story. The whole goddamn story. Soup 
		to nuts. Three acts. The whole goddamn-

				AUDREY
		It's alright, Barton. You don't have 
		to write actual scenes?

				BARTON
		No, but the whole goddamn  Audrey?  
		Have you ever had to read any of 
		Bill's wrestling scenarios?

	Audrey laughs.

				AUDREY
		Yes, I'm afraid I have.

				BARTON
		What are they like? What are they 
		about?

				AUDREY
		Well, usually, they're... simply 
		morality tales. There's a good 
		wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he 
		confronts at the end. In between, 
		the good wrestler has a love interest 
		or a child he has to protect.  Bill 
		would usually make the good wrestler 
		a backwoods type, or a convict. And 
		sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd 
		have the wrestler protecting an idiot 
		manchild.  The studio always hated 
		that. Oh, some of the scripts were 
		so... spirited!

	She laughs  then stops, realizing that she has laughed. She 
	looks at Barton.

				AUDREY
		...Barton.

	She shakes her head.

				AUDREY
		...Look, it's really just a formula. 
		You don't have to type your soul 
		into it.  We'll invent some names 
		and a new setting.  I'll help you 
		and it won't take any time at all. I 
		did it for Bill so many times 

	Barton's pacing comes up short.

				BARTON
		Did what for Bill?

	Guardedly:

				AUDREY
		Well... THIS.

				BARTON
		You wrote his scripts for him?

				AUDREY
		Well, the basic ideas were frequently 
		his-

				BARTON
		You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus 
		Christ, you wrote his  what about 
		before that?

				AUDREY
		Before what?

				BARTON
		Before Bill came to Hollywood.

	Audrey is clearly reluctant to travel this path.

				AUDREY
		Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so 
		to speak-

				BARTON
		What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, 
		how long have you been his... 
		secretary?

				AUDREY
		Barton, I think we should concentrate 
		on OUR little project-

				BARTON
		I want to know how many of Bill's 
		books you wrote!

				AUDREY
		Barton!

				BARTON
		I want to know!

				AUDREY
		Barton, honestly, only the last couple-

				BARTON
		Hah!

				AUDREY
		And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL,
		really, when he'd been drinking-

				BARTON
		I'll bet. Jesus  "The grand 
		productive days." What a goddamn 
		phony.

	He resumes pacing.

				BARTON
		...W.P. Mayhew.  William Goddamn 
		Phony Mayhew. All his guff about 
		escape. Hah!  I'LL say he escaped!

	Barton sighs and looks at his watch.

				BARTON
		...Well, we don't have much time.

	He sits down next to Audrey. Audrey's tone is gentle.

				AUDREY
		It'll be fine... Don't judge him, 
		Barton.  Don't condescend to him...

	She strokes Barton's hair.

				AUDREY
		...It's not as simple as you think. 
		I helped Bill most by appreciating 
		him, by understanding him. We all 
		need understanding, Barton. Even 
		you, tonight, it's all you really 
		need...

	She kisses him.

	As Barton tentatively responds, we are panning away.

	We frame up on the door to the bathroom and track in toward 
	the sink. We can hear the creak of bedsprings and Audrey and 
	Barton's breath, becoming labored.

	The continuing track brings us up to and over the lid of the 
	sink to frame up its drain, a perfect black circle in the 
	porcelain white.  We track up to the drain and are enveloped 
	by it as the sound of lovemaking mixes into the groaning of 
	pipes.

							BLACK

								FADE IN:

	BARTON

	The hum of a mosquito brings us out of the black and we are 
	looking down at Barton, in bed, asleep. It is dawn.

	Barton's eyes snap open.

	HIS POV

	The white ceiling. A humming black speck flits across the 
	white.

	BARTON

	Slowly, cautiously, he props himself up, his look following 
	the sound of the mosquito.

	His gaze travels down and to one side and is arrested as the 
	hum stops.

	HIS POV

	Audrey lies facing away on her side of the bed, half covered 
	by a blanket.

	BARTON

	Gingerly, he reaches over and draws the blanket down Audrey's 
	back.

	HIS POV

	The alabaster white of Audrey's back.

	The mosquito is feeding on it.

	EXTREME CLOSE ON BARTON'S EYES

	Looking.

	EXTREME CLOSE ON THE MOSQUITO

	Swelling with blood.

	WIDER

	As Barton's hand comes through frame and slaps Audrey's back.  

	She doesn't react.

	Barton draws his hand away. Audrey's back is smeared with 
	blood.

	ON BARTON

	He looks at his hand.

	HIS POV

	His hand is dripping with blood. Too much blood.

	BACK TO BARTON

	Eyes wide, he looks down at the bed.

	HIS POV

	Blood seeps up into the sheet beneath the curve of Audrey's 
	back.

	BARTON

	He pulls Audrey's shoulder.

	AUDREY

	She rolls onto her back. Her eyes are wide and lifeless.  

	Her stomach is nothing but blood. The top sheet, drawn to 
	her waist is drenched red and clings to her body.

	BARTON

	He screams.

	He screams again.

	We hear rapid and heavy footfalls next door, a door opening 
	and closing, and then a loud banging on Barton's door.  

	Barton's head spins towards the door. He is momentarily 
	frozen.

	Another knock.

	Barton leaps to his feet and hurries to the door.

	THE DOORWAY

	Over Barton's shoulder as he cracks the door.

	Charlie stands in the hall in his boxer shorts and a 
	sleeveless tee.

				CHARLIE
		Are you all right?

	Barton stares dumbly for a moment.

				CHARLIE
		...Can I come in?

				BARTON
		No!... I'm fine. Thank you.

				CHARLIE
		Are you sure 

				BARTON
		No... no...

	Barton is nodding as he shuts the door in Charlie's face.  

	He walks back into the room.

	HIS POV

	Audrey's corpse, in long shot, face up on the bed.

	BARTON

	He walks toward the bed, wheels before he reaches it, and 
	starts back toward the door.

	He stops short and turns back again to the room. He averts 
	his eyes  as it happens, toward the secretary.

	He walks stiffly over and sits, his back to Audrey.

	CLOSE ON BARTON

	As he sits in. He stares emptily down at the desk, in shock, 
	totally shut down. Behind him, we can see Audrey on the bed.  

	He stares for a long beat.

	Strange, involuntary noises come from his throat. He is not 
	in control.

	Becoming aware of the noise he is making, he stops.

	He lurches to his feet.

	THE DOORWAY

	As Barton enters, opens the door, and sticks his head out.

	HALLWAY

	Barton peers out the see if the coast is clear.

	HIS POV

	The long hallway.

	In the deep background, Chet, the night clerk, is stooping 
	in front of a door to pick up a pair of shoes. Next to him 
	is a castored shoe caddy.

	All of the doorways between us and Chet are empty of shoes.

	CHET

	Close on him as, mid-stoop, he looks up.

	CHET'S POV

	Up the long hall. In the deep background a door is closing.

	CHET

	He pauses, then straightens up and puts the shoes on the 
	shoe caddy. It squeaks as he pushes it on down the hall.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	Barton stands at the door, listening to a very faint squeak.  
	Eventually it becomes inaudible.

	He cracks the door again, looks out, and exits.

	HALLWAY

	Barton goes to Charlie's room and knocks.

	Footfalls end as the door is cracked open.

				CHARLIE
		Barton. Are you all right?

				BARTON
		No... Can I come in?

				CHARLIE
		Why don't we go to your room-

				BARTON
		Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta 
		help me.

	Once again he is breathing hard.

	Charlie steps out into the hall and shuts the door behind 
	him.

				CHARLIE
		Get a grip on yourself, brother. 
		Whatever the problem is, we'll sort 
		it out.

				BARTON
		Charlie, I'm in trouble  something 
		horrible's happened  I've gotta 
		call the police...

	Charlie leads him towards his room.

				BARTON
		...Will you stay with me till they 
		get here?

				CHARLIE
		Don't worry about it, Barton. We can 
		sort it-

	He is pushing Barton's door open, but Barton grabs an elbow 
	to stop him.

				BARTON
		Before you go in  I didn't do this. 
		I don't know how it happened, but I 
		didn't... I want you to know that...

	Charlie looks into his eyes. For a moment the two men stare 
	at each other  Charlie's look inquisitive, Barton's 
	supplicating.

	Finally, Charlie nods.

				CHARLIE
		Okay.

	He turns and pushes open the door.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	The two men enter.

	Barton lingers by the door. Charlie walks into the foreground 
	to look off toward the bed.

	His eyes widen and he screams.

	He turns and disappears into the bathroom. We hear vomiting, 
	then the flush of a toilet.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus... Jesus... Jesus have mercy...

	His reaction has not encouraged Barton, who is more and more 
	agitated.

	Charlie emerges from the bathroom, sweating.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is 
		this?  What're we gonna do?

				BARTON
		I've gotta call the police  or you 
		could call for me 

				CHARLIE
		Hold on 

				BARTON
		You gotta believe me 

				CHARLIE
		Hold on 

				BARTON
		I didn't do this, I did NOT do this

				CHARLIE
		Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. 
		Tell me what happened.

				BARTON
		I don't know! I woke up, she was... 
		God, you gotta believe me!

	Charlie, in spite of himself, is sneaking horrified glances 
	back into the room.

				CHARLIE
		I believe you, brother, but this 
		don't look good.

				BARTON
		We gotta call the police 

				CHARLIE
		Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				CHARLIE
		What do you think happened?

				BARTON
		I don't know!  Maybe it was her...  
		boyfriend. I passed out. I don't 
		know.  Won't the police be able to 

				CHARLIE
		Stop with the police! Wake up, friend!  
		This does not look good! They hang 
		people for this!

				BARTON
		But I didn't do it  don't you believe 
		me?

				CHARLIE
		I believe you  I KNOW you. But why 
		should the police?

	Barton gives him a dumb stare.

				CHARLIE
		...Did you... Barton, between you 
		and me, did you have sexual 
		intercourse?

	Barton stares at Charlie. He swallows.

	Charlie shakes his head.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus... They can tell that...

				BARTON
		They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They 
		gotta have mercy!

				CHARLIE
		You're in pictures, Barton. Even if 
		you got cleared eventually, this 
		would ruin you.

	He turns and starts toward the bed.

				CHARLIE
		...Wait in the bathroom.

	BATHROOM

	Later. Barton, still in his underwear, sits leaning against 
	the wall, staring glassily at his feet.

	From the other room we hear the creak of bedsprings and the 
	sounds of bed clothes being torn off.

	Finally there is a last creak of bedsprings and the sound of 
	Charlie grunting under great weight.

	We hear heavy footsteps approaching.

	Barton looks up through the open bathroom door.

	HIS POV

	Charlie is groping for the front doorknob, cradling the 
	sheetswaddled body in his arms.

	BACK TO BARTON

	His neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back 
	to hit the wall.

	BLACK

	Slap! Slap!  

	We are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap 
	and backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now 
	wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has 
	blood flecks across the belly.

				CHARLIE
		You passed out.

	Barton looks groggily up.

				BARTON
		...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?

				CHARLIE
		She's dead, Barton! If that was her 
		name.

	TRACKING IN ON BARTON

	He stares at Charlie.

				CHARLIE
			(off)
		Barton, listen to me. You gotta act 
		like nothing's happened. Put this 
		totally out of your head. I know 
		that's hard, but your play from here 
		on out is just to go about business 
		as usual. Give us some time to sort 
		this out...

	Barton looks at his watch.

	THE WATCH

	7:45.

				CHARLIE
			(off)
		...Just put it out of you head...

	TRACKING

	Toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and 
	statuary set amid palms trees.

	Sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching 
	Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair.

				LIPNIK
		Bart! So happy to see ya!

	REVERSE

	Pulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze.

	Barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much 
	sun.

				LIPNIK
		Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then 
		talk!  Drink?

	As Barton sits:

				BARTON
		Yeah... rye whiskey?

				LIPNIK
		Boy! You writers! Work hard, play 
		hard!  That's what I hear, anyway...

	He laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze.

				LIPNIK
		... Lou.

	Lou exits.

				LIPNIK
		Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're 
		going along great.  Thinks we've got 
		a real winner in this one. And let 
		me tell you something, I'm counting 
		on it. I've taken an interest. Not 
		to interfere, mind you  hardly seems 
		necessary in your case. A writer  a 
		storyteller  of your stature.  
		Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. 
		Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting 
		in the audience, the lights go down, 
		Capitol logo comes up... you're on!

	He beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched 
	lips.

				BARTON
		Yeah, okay... well... we fade in...

	Lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story.

				BARTON
		...It's a tenement building. On the 
		Lower East Side...

				LIPNIK
		Great! He's poor, this wrestler! 
		He's had to struggle!

				BARTON
		And then... well...

	Barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits 
	against the sun. He looks back at Lipnik.

				BARTON
		...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik?

				LIPNIK
		CAN you?  You damn well better be. 
		Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my 
		business dealings  well, of course, 
		you can't always be honest, not with 
		the sharks swimming around this town 
		 but if you're a writer, you don't 
		think about those things  if I'd 
		been totally honest, I wouldn't be 
		within a mile of this pool  unless 
		I was cleaning it. But that's no 
		reason for you not to be. Honest, I 
		mean.  Not cleaning the pool.

	Lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. 
	Lou sits.

	Barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, 
	but must finally take the plunge.

				BARTON
		Well... to be honest, I'm never really 
		comfortable discussing a work in 
		progress.  I've got it all worked 
		out in my head, but sometimes if you 
		force it out in words  prematurely 
		 the wrong words  well, your meaning 
		changes, and it changes your own 
		mind, and you never get it back  so 
		I'd just as soon not talk about it.

	Lipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a 
	long beat.

	Lou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to 
	fill the silence.

				LOU
		...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never 
		mind how long I've been in pictures. 
		Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just 
		about since they were invented. HE 
		practically invented them.

	Lipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou.

				LOU
		...Now I think if he's interested in 
		what one of his contract employees 
		is doing while he draws pay, I think 
		that employee ought to tell him, if 
		he wants to stay an employee. Right 
		now the contents of your head are 
		the property of Capitol Pictures, so 
		if I were you I would speak up. And 
		pretty goddamn fast.

	Lou looks at Barton, expectantly. Lipnik continues to stare 
	at Lou.

	There is a long silence, terribly heavy.

	Finally, Lipnik explodes  at Lou.

				LIPNIK
		You lousy sonofabitch! You're telling 
		this man  this ARTIST  what to 
		do?!

	Lou Breeze is stunned.

				LOU
		Mr. Lipnik, I 

				LIPNIK
		This man creates for a living! He 
		puts food on your table and on mine! 
		THANK him for it!  Thank him, you 
		ungrateful sonofabitch! Thank him or 
		YOU'RE fired!

	Barton is staring, aghast.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, that's not really necessar-

	Lipnik, still staring at Lou, gives no sign of hearing Barton. 
	He rises and points.

				LIPNIK
		Get down on your knees, you 
		sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees 
		and kiss this man's feet!

				LOU
		Mr. Lipnik, please 

				BARTON
		I  Mr. Lipnik 

				LIPNIK
		KISS THIS MAN'S FEET!!

	Lou, aghast, looks at Barton.

	Barton, aghast, can only return the same stunned look.

	Lipnik snarls at Lou:

				LIPNIK
		...Okay, get out of here. You're 
		fired, you understand me?  Get out 
		of my sight.

	Lou gets stiffly to his feet and stumbles away.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, I 

				LIPNIK
		I apologize, Barton.

				BARTON
		No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been 
		a great help 

				LIPNIK
		You don't have to cover for him. 
		It's noble of you, but these things 
		happen in business.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much 
		better if you could reconsider 

				LIPNIK
		Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to 
		pull this out of your head. If that 
		sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to 
		you, goddammit, I will. I respect 
		your artistry and your methods, and 
		if you can't fill us in yet, well 
		hell, we should be kissing your feet 
		for your fine efforts.

	He gets down on his knees in front of Barton.

				LIPNIK
		...You know in the old country we 
		were taught, as very young children, 
		that there's no shame in supplicatin' 
		yourself when you respect someone.

	Barton stares, horrified, at Lipnik, on the ground at his 
	feet.

				LIPNIK
		...On behalf of Capitol Pictures, 
		the administration, and all a the 
		stockholders, please accept this as 
		a symbol of our apology and respect.

	BARTON'S POV

	Lipnik kisses his shoe and looks up at him.

	Behind Lipnik the pool glitters.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	The cut has a hard musical sting. Out of the sting comes a 
	loud but distorted thumping noise.

	We are looking down, high angle, form one corner of the room. 
	We are presented with a motionless tableau: Barton sits, 
	hunched, in the far corner, elbows on knees, staring at the 
	bed in front of him. He wears only trousers and a T-shirt 
	and his body and face glisten with sweat. The bed's sheets 
	have been stripped and the ratty gray mattress has an enormous 
	rust-red stain in the middle.

	After a beat, in the foreground, the only motion in the scene: 
	A bead of tacky yellow wall-sweat dribbles down the near 
	wall.

	Silence, then the thumping repeats, resolving itself to a 
	knock at the door.

	Barton rises slowly and crosses to the door.

	THE DOOR

	Barton opens it to Charlie, who is dressed in a baggy suit, 
	his hair slicked back, a tan fedora pushed back on his head. 
	It is the first time we have seen him well turned out.

	A battered briefcase is on the floor next to him. He holds a 
	parcel in his left hand, about one foot square, wrapped in 
	brown paper and tied up with twine.

				CHARLIE
		Barton. Can I come in?

	Barton stands back from the door and Charlie picks up his 
	briefcase and enters.

	THE ROOM

	As the two men enter.

				BARTON
		Jesus... You're leaving.

				CHARLIE
		Have to, old timer. Just for a while.

	Barton sounds desperate:

				BARTON
		Jesus, Charlie, I...

				CHARLIE
		Everything's okay, believe me. I 
		know it's rough mentally, but 
		everything's taken care of.

				BARTON
		Charlie! I've got no one else here! 
		You're the only person I know in Los 
		Angeles...

	He starts weeping

				BARTON
		...that I can talk to.

	Charlie, also disturbed and unhappy, wraps both arms around 
	Barton.

	Barton sobs unashamedly into his shoulder. Charlie is somber.

				CHARLIE
		It's okay... It's okay...

				BARTON
		Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy 
		 like I'm losing my mind. I don't 
		know what to do... I didn't do it, 
		believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. 
		I just...

	His breath comes in short gasping heaves.

				BARTON
		...I just don't know what... to do

				CHARLIE
		You gotta get a grip on, brother. 
		You gotta just carry on  just for a 
		few days, till I get back. Try and 
		stay here, keep your door locked. 
		Don't talk to anyone. We just gotta 
		keep our heads and we'll figure it 
		out.

				BARTON
		Yeah, but Charlie 

				CHARLIE
		Dammit, don't argue with me. You 
		asked me to believe you  well I do.  
		Now don't argue with me.

	He looks at Barton for a beat.

				CHARLIE
		...Look, pal  can you do something 
		for me?

	Charlie hands him his parcel.

				CHARLIE
		...Keep this for me, till I get back.

	Barton, snuffling, accepts the package.

				CHARLIE
		...It's just personal stuff. I don't 
		wanna drag it with me, but I don't 
		trust 'em downstairs, and I'd like 
		to think it's in good hands.

	Still snuffling:

				BARTON
		Sure, Charlie.

				CHARLIE
		Funny, huh, when everything that's 
		important to a guy, everything he 
		wants to keep from a lifetime  when 
		he can fit it into a little box like 
		that. I guess... I guess it's kind 
		of pathetic.

	Wallowing in self-pity:

				BARTON
		It's more than I've got.

				CHARLIE
		Well, keep it for me. Maybe it'll 
		bring you good luck. Yeah, it'll 
		help you finish your script. You'll 
		think about me...

	He thumps his chest.

				CHARLIE
		...Make me your wrestler. Then you'll 
		lick that story of yours.

	Barton is tearfully sincere:

				BARTON
		Thanks, Charlie.

	Charlie solemnly thrusts out his hand.

				CHARLIE
		Yeah, well, see you soon, friend. 
		You're gonna be fine.

	Barton shakes. As they walk to the door:

				BARTON
		You'll be back?

				CHARLIE
		Don't worry about that, compadre. 
		I'll be back.

	Barton shuts the door behind Charlie, locks it, and turns 
	around.

	HIS POV

	The room. The bed. The blood-stained mattress.

	Barton walks across the room and sits carefully at the edge 
	of the bed, avoiding the rust-colored stain. For a long beat, 
	he sits still, but something is building inside.

	Finally, when we hear the distant ding of the elevator 
	arriving for Charlie, it erupts:

	Barton sobs, with the unself-conscious grief of an abandoned 
	child.

	HIGH WIDE SHOT

	Barton weeping, alone on the bed, next to the rust-colored 
	stain.

								FADE OUT

								FADE IN:

	BATHING BEAUTY

	With the fade in, the sound of the surf mixes up.

	We pan down the picture to discover that a snapshot has been 
	tucked into a corner of the picture frame: it is the snap of 
	Charlie, smiling and waving, with his foot up on the running 
	board of the 1939 Ford roadster.

	BARTON

	Sitting at the desk, staring at the picture. From his glazed 
	eyes and the way his mouth hangs open, we may assume he has 
	been staring at the picture for some time.

	He notices something on the desk and picks it up.

	HIS POV

	The Holy Bible  Placed by the Gideons.

	Barton opens it, randomly, to the Book of Daniel. The text 
	is set in ornately Gothic type.

	"5. And the king, Nebuchadnezzar, answered and said to the 
	Chaldeans, I recall not my dream; if ye will not make known 
	unto me my dream, and its interpretation, ye shall be cut in 
	pieces, and of your tents shall be made a dunghill."

	BARTON

	Staring at the passage. His mouth hangs open.

	THE BIBLE

	Barton riffles to the first page.

	In bold type at the top:

	"THE BOOK OF GENESIS"

	Underneath, in the same ornately Gothic type:

	"Chapter One 1. Fade in on a tenement building on Manhattan's 
	Lower East Side.  Faint traffic noise is audible; 2. As is 
	the cry of fishmongers."

	BARTON

	Squinting at the page through bloodshot eyes.

	His mouth hangs open.

	BARTON'S ROOM  DAY

	At the cut the harsh clackety-clack of typing bangs in. 
	Sunlight burns against the sheers of Barton's window, making 
	it a painfully bright patch in the room which itself remains 
	fairly dim.

	Barton sits at the secretary, typing furiously.

	He finishes a page, yanks it out of the carriage, and places 
	it face-down on a short stack of face-down pages.

	He feeds in a blank sheet and resumes his rapid typing. He 
	is sweating, unshaven, and more haggard even than when we 
	left him the previous night.

	The telephone rings. After several rings Barton stops typing 
	and answers it, absently, still looking at his work. His 
	voice is hoarse.

				BARTON
		Hello... Chet... Who?...

	He puts the receiver down on the desk, leans over the 
	typewriter, and examines something he has just written.

	He picks the phone back up and listens for a beat.

				BARTON
		... No, don't send them up here. 
		I'll be right down.

	ELEVATOR

	A small oscillating fan whirs up in a corner of the elevator.  

	We pan down to Barton, who is riding down with Pete, the old 
	elevator operator. Barton's voice is hoarse with fatigue.

				BARTON
		...You read the Bible, Pete?

				PETE
		Holy Bible?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				PETE
		I think so... Anyway, I've heard 
		about it.

	Barton nods.

	They ride for a beat.

	LOBBY

	Late afternoon sun slants in from one side. The lobby has 
	the same golden ambiance as when first we saw it.

	Barton is walking toward two wing chairs in the shadows, 
	from which two men in suits are rising. One is tall, the 
	other short.

				POLICEMAN
		Fink?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				POLICEMAN #2
		Detective Mastrionotti.

				POLICEMAN #1
		Detective Deutsch.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		L.A.P.D.

				BARTON
		Uh-huh.

	All three sit in ancient maroon swing chairs. Mastrionotti 
	perches on the edge of his chair; Deutsch slumps back in the 
	shadows, studying Barton.

				DEUTSCH
		Got a couple questions to ask ya.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		What do you do, Fink?

	Still hoarse:

				BARTON
		I write.

				DEUTSCH
		Oh yeah? What kind of write?

				BARTON
		Well as a matter of fact, I write 
		for the pictures.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Big fuckin' deal.

				DEUTSCH
		You want my partner to kiss your 
		ass?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Would that be good enough for ya?

				BARTON
		No, I  I didn't mean to sound 

				DEUTSCH
		What DID you mean?

				BARTON
		I  I've got respect for  for working 
		guys, like you 

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Jesus! Ain't that a load off! You 
		live in 605?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

				DEUTSCH
		How long you been up there, Fink?

				BARTON
		A week, eight, nine days 

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Is this multiple choice?

				BARTON
		Nine days  Tuesday 

				DEUTSCH
		You know this slob?

	He is holding a small black-and-white photograph out toward 
	Barton.

	There is a long beat as Barton studies the picture.

				BARTON
		...Yeah, he... he lives next door to 
		me.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		That's right, Fink, he lives next 
		door to you.

				DEUTSCH
		Ever talk to him?

				BARTON
		...Once or twice. His name is Charlie 
		Meadows.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.

				DEUTSCH
		His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Also known as Madman Mundt.

				DEUTSCH
		He's a little funny in the head.

				BARTON
		What did... What did he 

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate 
		people with a shotgun and then cut 
		their heads off.

				DEUTSCH
		Yeah, he's funny that way.

				BARTON
		I...

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Started in Kansas City. Couple of 
		housewives.

				DEUTSCH
		Couple of days ago we see the same 
		M.O. out in Los Feliz.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.

				DEUTSCH
		All of which he's now missin'.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Well, some of his throat was there.

				DEUTSCH
		Physician, heal thyself.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Good luck with no fuckin' head.

				DEUTSCH
		Anyway.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Hollywood precinct finds another 
		stiff yesterday. Not too far from 
		here. This one's better looking than 
		the doc.

				DEUTSCH
		Female caucasian, thirty years old. 
		Nice tits. No head. You ever see 
		Mundt with anyone meets that 
		description?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		But, you know, with the head still 
		on.

				BARTON
		...No. I never saw him with anyone 
		else.

				DEUTSCH
		So. You talked to Mundt, what about?

				BARTON
		Nothing, really. Said he was in the 
		insurance business.

	Deutsch indicates Mastrionotti.

				DEUTSCH
		Yeah, and he's Buck Rogers.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		No reputable company would hire a 
		guy like that.

				BARTON
		Well that's what he said.

				DEUTSCH
		What else?

				BARTON
		He... I'm trying to think... Nothing, 
		really... He... He said he liked 
		Jack Oakie pictures.

	Mastrionotti looks at Deutsch. Deutsch looks at Mastrionotti.  
	After a beat, Mastrionotti looks back at Barton.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Ya know, Fink, ordinarily we say 
		anything you might remember could be 
		helpful. But I'll be frank with you: 
		That is not helpful.

				DEUTSCH
		Ya see how he's not writing it down?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Fink. That's a Jewish name, isn't 
		it?

				BARTON
		Yeah.

	Mastrionotti gets to his feet, looking around the lobby.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Yeah, I didn't think this dump was 
		restricted.

	He digs in his pocket.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...Mundt has disappeared. I don't 
		think he'll be back. But...

	He hands Barton a card.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...give me a call if you see him. Or 
		if you remember something that isn't 
		totally idiotic.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	We are tracking toward the paper-wrapped parcel that sits on 
	the nightstand next to Barton's bed.   

	Barton enters and picks it up. He holds it for a beat, looking 
	at it, then brings it over to the secretary and sits.

	He shakes it.

	No sound; whatever is inside is well packed.

	Barton holds it up to his ear and listens for a long beat, 
	as if it were a seashell and he is listening for the surf.  

	Finally he puts it on his desk, beneath the picture of the 
	bathing beauty, and starts typing, quickly and steadily.

								DISSOLVE

						    THROUGH TO:

	REVERSE

	Some time later; Barton still types. He is face to us; beyond 
	him we can see the bed with its rust-colored stain.

	The phone rings. Barton ignores it. It continues to ring.  

	Barton rises and exits frame; we hold on to the bed in the 
	background. We hear Barton's footsteps on the bathroom tile 
	as the phone continues ringing.

	Barton sits back into frame stuffing cotton into each ear. 
	He resumes typing.

	ANOTHER ANGLE

	Barton typing. The desk trembles under the working of the 
	typewriter.  Charlie's parcel chatters.

	Barton takes a finished page out of the carriage and places 
	it face down on the growing stack to his right. He feeds in 
	a new page. We hear the muted ding of the elevator down the 
	hall. Barton resumes typing.

	We hear a knock on Barton's door. Barton does not react, 
	apparently not hearing.

	THE DOORWAY

	We are close on the bottom of the door. Someone in the hallway 
	is sliding a note beneath the door; then his shadow disappears 
	and his footsteps recede.

	The note is a printed message headed: "While You Were Out... 
	" Underneath are the printed words: "You were called by" 
	and, handwritten in the space following: "Mr. Ben Geisler."  

	Handwritten below, in the message space:

	"Thank you. Lipnik loved your meeting. Keep up the good work." 

	Barton's offscreen typing continues steadily.

								FADE OUT

	HALLWAY

	A perfectly symmetrical wide low angle shot of the empty 
	hall.  Shoes are set put in front of each door except for 
	one in the middle background.

	At the cut in we hear faint, regular typing.

	We hold for a beat. There is no motion. The long, empty hall. 
	The distant typing.

	We hold.

	The typing stops. There is a beat of quiet.

	It is broken by the sound of a door opening. It is the 
	shoeless door in the middle background.

	A hand reaches out to place a pair of shoes in the doorway.  

	The hand withdraws.

	The door closes.

	A short beat of silence.

	The distant typing resumes.

	The long empty hall. The distant typing.

								FADE OUT

	OVER THE BLACK

	We hear the distant sound of a woman's voice, tinny and 
	indistinct.

				WOMAN
		Just a minute and I'll connect you...

								FADE IN:

	CLOSE ON BARTON

	His eyes are red-rimmed and wild. He sits on the edge of his 
	bed holding the phone to his ear.

	His voice is unnaturally loud:

				BARTON
		Hello? Operator! I can't... Oh!

	He stops, reaches up, takes a cotton wad out of his ear.

	We hear various clicks and clacks as the telephone lines 
	switch, and then a distant ring. The phone rings three or 
	four times before it is answered by a groggy voice.

				VOICE
		...Hello.

				BARTON
		Garland, it's me.

				GARLAND
		Barton? What time is it? Are you all 
		right?

				BARTON
		Yeah, I'm fine, Garland  I have to 
		talk to you. I'm calling long 
		distance.

				GARLAND
		Okay.

	Muffled, we hear Garland speaking to someone else.

				GARLAND
		...It's Barton. Calling long distance.

	Back into the receiver:

				GARLAND
		...What is it Barton? Are you okay?

				BARTON
		I'm fine, garland, but I have to 
		talk with you.

				GARLAND
		Go ahead, son.

				BARTON
		It's about what I'm writing, Garland. 
		It's really... I think it's really 
		big.

				GARLAND
		What do you mean, Barton?

				BARTON
		Not big in the sense of large  
		although it's that too. I mean 
		important. This may be the most 
		IMPORTANT work I've done.

				GARLAND
		Well, I'm... glad to hear that 

				BARTON
		Very important, Garland. I just 
		thought you should know that. Whatever 
		happens.

				GARLAND
		...That's fine.

				BARTON
		Have you read the Bible, Garland?

				GARLAND
		...Barton, is everything okay?

				BARTON
		Yes... Isn't it?

				GARLAND
		Well, I'm just asking. You sound a 
		little 

	Guardedly:

				BARTON
		Sound a little what?

				GARLAND
		Well, you just... sound a little

	Bitterly:

				BARTON
		Thanks, Garland. Thanks for all the 
		encouragement.

	He slams down the phone.

	OVER HIS SHOULDER

	A one-quarter shot on Barton from behind as he picks up the 
	cotton wad and sticks it back in his right ear.

	He resumes typing, furiously.

	After a beat he mutters, still typing.

				BARTON
		...Nitwit.

	THE BATHING BEAUTY

	Later. We hear typing and the roar of the surf.'

	CLOSE ON TYPEWRITER

	We are extremely close on the key-strike area. As we cut in 
	Barton is typing:

	"p-o-s-t-c-a-r-d-."

	The carriage returns a couple of times and "T-H-EE-N-D" is 
	typed in.

	The paper is ripped out of the carriage.

	CLOSE ON A STACK OF PAGES

	Lying face down on the desk; the last page is added, face 
	down, to the pile.  The pile is picked up, its edges are 
	straightened with a couple of thumps against the desktop, 
	and then the pile is replaced on the desk, face up.  The 
	title page reads:

	"THE BURLYMAN 
	Motion Picture Scenario 
	By 
	Barton Fink"

	Barton's right hand enters frame to deposit a small cotton 
	wad on top of the script.

	Barton's left hand enters to deposit another small cotton 
	wad on top of the script.

	We hear Barton walk away. We hear bath water run.

	THE BATHING BEAUTY

	Still looking out to sea.

	USO HALL

	We are booming down to the dance floor as a raucous band 
	plays an up-tempo number.

	BARTON

	Dancing animatedly, almost maniacally, his fingers jabbing 
	the air.

	The hall is crowded, but Barton is one of few men not in 
	uniform.

	USO GIRL

	Giggling, dancing opposite Barton.

				GIRL
		You're cute!

	BARTON

	Caught up in his dancing, oblivious to the girl.

	A white uniformed arm reaches in to tap Barton on the 
	shoulder.

				SAILOR
		'Scuse me, buddy, mind if I cut in?

	Barton glares at him.

				BARTON
		This is MY dance, sailor!

				SAILOR
		C'mon buddy, I'm shipping out 
		tomorrow.

	For some reason, Barton is angry.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer! Celebrating the 
		completion of something GOOD!  Do 
		you understand that, sailor? I'm a 
		WRITER!

	His bellowing has drawn onlookers' attention.

				VOICES
		Step aside, four-eyes! Let someone 
		else spin the dame! Give the navy a 
		dance! Hey, Four-F, take a hike!

	Barton turns furiously against the crowd.

				BARTON
		I'm a writer, you monsters! I CREATE!  
		He points at his head.

				BARTON
		...This is my uniform!

	He taps his skull.

				BARTON
		...THIS is how I serve the common 
		man!  THIS is where I 

	WHAPP! An infantry man tags Barton's chin on the button. 
	Bodies surge. The crowd gasps. The band blares nightmarishly 
	on.

	HOTEL HALLWAY

	Quiet at the cut.

	After a beat, there is a faint ding at the end of the hall 
	and, as the elevator door opens, we faintly hear:

				PETE
		This stop: six.

	Barton, disheveled, emerges and stumbles wearily down the 
	hall. He stops in front of his door, takes his key out, and 
	enters the room.

	BARTON'S POV

	Mastrionotti is sitting on the edge of the bed reading 
	Barton's manuscript.

	Deutsch stands in front of the desk staring at the bathing 
	beauty.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Mother: What is to become of him. 
		Father: We'll be hearing from that 
		crazy wrestler.  And I don't mean a 
		postcard. Fade out. The end.

	He looks up at Barton.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...I thought you said you were a 
		writer.

				DEUTSCH
		I dunno, Duke. I kinda liked it.

				BARTON
		Keep your filthy eyes off that.

	Deutsch turns toward Barton and throws a folded newspaper at 
	him.

				DEUTSCH
		You made morning papers, Fink.

	Barton opens the paper. A headline reads: Writer Found 
	Headless in Chavez Ravine. The story has two pictures  a 
	studio publicity portrait of Mayhew, and a photograph of the 
	crime scene: two plainclothes detectives stare down into a 
	gulley as a uniformed cop restrains a pair of leashed dogs.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Second one of your friends to end up 
		dead.

				DEUTSCH
		You didn't tell us you knew the dame.

	With a jerk of his thumb, Mastrionotti indicates the 
	bloodstained bed.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?

				DEUTSCH
		Give you nose bleeds?

	Barton crosses the room and sits at the foot of the bed, 
	staring at the newspaper.

				DEUTSCH
		Just tell me one thing, Fink: Where'd 
		you put their heads?

	Distractedly:

				BARTON
		Charlie... Charlie's back...

				MASTRIONOTTI
		No kidding, bright boy  we smelt 
		Mundt all over this. Was he the idea 
		man?

				DEUTSCH
		Tell us where the heads are, maybe 
		they'll go easy on you.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		Only fry you once.

	Barton rubs his temples.

				BARTON
		Could you come back later?  It's 
		just...  too hot... My head is killing 
		me.

				DEUTSCH
		All right, forget the heads. Where's 
		Mundt, Fink?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		He teach you to do it?

				DEUTSCH
		You two have some sick sex thing?

				BARTON
		Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!

				MASTRIONOTTI
		You're a sick fuck, Fink.

				DEUTSCH
		All right, moron, you're under arrest.

	Barton seems oblivious to the two men.

				BARTON
		Charlie's back. It's hot... He's 
		back.

	Down the hall we hear the ding of the arriving elevator.  

	Mastrionotti cocks his head with a quizzical look.

	He rises and walks slowly out into the hall. Deutsch wathces 
	him go.

	HIS POV

	Mastrionotti in the hallway in full shot, framed by the door, 
	still looking puzzled.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...Fred...

	Deutsch stands and pushes his suit coat back past the gun on 
	his hip, revealing a pair of handcuffs on his belt. He 
	unhitches the cuffs and slips one around Barton's right wrist 
	and the other around a loop in the wrought iron footboard of 
	the bed.

				DEUTSCH
		Sit tight, Fink.

	THE HALLWAY

	As Deutsch joins Mastrionotti.

				DEUTSCH
		Why's it so goddamn hot out here?

				MASTRIONOTTI
		...Fred...

	Deutsch looks where Mastrionotti is looking.

	THE WALL

	Tacky yellow fluid streams down. The walls are pouring sweat.  

	The hallway is quiet.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	They look at each other. They look down the hall.

	THEIR POV

	The elevator stands open at the far end of the empty hall.  

	For a long beat, nothing.

	Finally Pete, the elevator man, emerges.

	At this distance, he is a small figure, stumbling this way 
	and that, his hands presseed against the sides of his head.  

	He turns to face Mastrionotti and Deutsch and takes a few 
	steps forward, still clutching his head.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Watching.

	PETE

	He takes on last step, then collapses.

	As he pitches forward his hands fall away from his head. His 
	head separates from his neck, hits the floor, and rolls away 
	from his body with a dull irregular trundle sound.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Wide-eyed, they look at each other, then back down the hall.  

	All is quiet.

	THE HALLWAY

	Smoke is beginning to drift into the far end of the hall.  

	We hear a muted rumble.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Mastrionotti tugs at his tie. He slowly unholsters his gun.  
	Deutsch slowly, hypnotically, follows suit.

				DEUTSCH
		... Show yourself, Mundt!

	More quiet.

	THE HALLWAY

	More smoke.

	LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR

	The crack where the floor of the elevator meets that of the 
	hall.

	It flickers with red light from below. Bottom-lit smoke sifts 
	up.

	CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI

	Standing in the foreground, gun at ready. Sweat pours down 
	his face.

	Behind him, Deutsch stands nervously in the light-spill from 
	Barton's doorway.

	The rumble and crackle of fire grows louder.

	THE HALLWAY

	More smoke.

	PATCH OF WALL

	Sweating.

	A swath of wallpaper sags away from the top of the wall, 
	exposing glistening lath underneath.

	With a light airy pop, the lathwork catches on fire.

	MASTRIONOTTI AND DEUTSCH

	Sweating.

				DEUTSCH
		...Mundt!

	THEIR POV

	The hallway. Its end-facing-wall slowly spreads flame from 
	where the wallpaper droops.

	LOW STEEP ANGLE ON ELEVATOR DOOR

	More red bottom-lit smoke seeps up from the crack between 
	elevator and hallway floors.

	With a groan of tension relieved cables and a swaying of the 
	elevator door, a pair of feet crosses the threshold into the 
	doorway.

	JUMPING BACK

	Wide on the hallway. Charlie Meadows has emerged from the 
	elevator and is hellishly backlit by the flame.

	His suit coat hangs open. His hat is pushed back on his head. 
	From his right hand his briefcase dangles.

	He stands motionless, facing us. There is something monumental 
	in his posture, shoulders thrown back.

	MASTRIONOTTI

	Tensed. Behind him, Deutsch gulps.

				MASTRIONOTTI
		There's a boy, Mundt. Put the policy 
		case down and your mitts in the air.

	CHARLIE

	He leans slowly down to put the briefcase on the floor.

	CLOSE ON MASTRIONOTTI

	Relax. He murmurs:

				MASTRIONOTTI
		He's complying.

	BACK TO CHARLIE

	He straightens up from the briefcase, a sawed-off shotgun in 
	his hands.

	BOOM! The shotgun spits fire.

	Mastrionotti's face is peppered by buckshot and he is blown 
	back down the hallway into Deutsch.

	Bellowing fills the hallway over the roar of the fire:

				CHARLIE
		LOOK UPON ME! LOOK UPON ME! I'LL 
		SHOW YOU THE LIFE OF THE MIND!!

	THE HALLWAY

	The fire starts racing down the hallway.

	CLOSE STEEP ANGLE ON PATCH OF WALL

	Fire races along the wall-sweat goopus.

	TRACK IN ON DEUTSCH

	His eyes widen at Charlie and the approaching fire; his gun 
	dangles forgotten from his right hand.

	HIS POV

	Charlie is charging down the hallway, holding his shotgun 
	loosely in front of his chest, in double-time position. The 
	fire races along with him.

	He is bellowing:

				CHARLIE
		LOOK UPON ME! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
		OF THE MIND! I'LL SHOW YOU THE LIFE 
		OF THE MIND!

	DEUTSCH

	Terrified, he turns and runs.

	REVERSE PULLING DEUTSCH

	As he runs down the flaming hallway, pursued by flames, smoke, 
	and Karl Mundt  who, also on the run, levels his shotgun.

	BOOM!

	PUSHING DEUTSCH

	His legs and feet spout blood, paddle futilely at the air, 
	then come down in a twisting wobble, like a car on blown 
	tires, and pitch him helplessly to the floor.

	PULLING CHARLIE

	He slows to a trot and cracks open the shotgun.

	PUSHING DEUTSCH

	Weeping and dragging himself forward on his elbows.

	PULLING CHARLIE

	He slows to a walk.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	Barton strains at his handcuffs.

	HIS POV

	Through the open doorway we see Charlie pass, pushing two 
	shells into his shotgun.

	PULLING DEUTSCH

	Charlie looms behind him and  THWACK  snaps the shotgun 
	closed.

	Deutsch rolls over to rest on his elbows, facing Charlie.  

	Charlie primes the shotgun  CLACK.

	He presses both barrels against the bridge of Deutsh's nose.

				CHARLIE
		Heil Hitler.

	DEUTSCH

	Screams.

	CHARLIE

	Tightens a finger over both triggers. He squeezes.

	BLAM!

	TRACK IN ON BARTON

	He flinches.

	The gunshot echoes away.

	Barton strains at the handcuffs.

	We hear Charlie's footsteps approach  slowly, heavily.

	THE DOORWAY

	Charlie, walking down the hall, glances in and seems mildly 
	surprised to see Barton. The set of his jaw relaxes. His 
	expression softens. He pushes his hat farther back on his 
	head.

				CHARLIE
		Barton!

	He shakes is head and whistles.

				CHARLIE
		...Brother, is it hot.

	He walks into the room.

	BARTON'S ROOM

	As Charlie wearily enters.

				CHARLIE
		How you been, buddy?

	He props the shotgun in a corner and sits facing Barton, who 
	stared at him.

				CHARLIE
		...Don't look at me like that, 
		neighbor.  It's just me  Charlie.

				BARTON
		I hear it's Mundt. Madman Mundt.

	Charlie reaches a flask from his pocket.

				CHARLIE
		Jesus, people can be cruel...

	He takes a long draught from his flask, then gives a haunted 
	stare.

				CHARLIE
		...if it's not my build, it's my 
		personality.

	Charlie is perspiring heavily. The fire rumbles in the 
	hallway.

				CHARLIE
		...They say I'm a madman, Barton, 
		but I'm not mad at anyone. Honest 
		I'm not. Most guys I just feel sorry 
		for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to 
		think about what they're going 
		through. How trapped they are. I 
		understand it. I feel for 'em. So I 
		try and help them out...

	He reached up to loosen his tie and pop his collar button.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus. Yeah. I know what it feels 
		like, when things get all balled up 
		at the head office. It puts you 
		through hell, Barton. So I help people 
		out. I just wish someone would do as 
		much for me...

	He stares miserably down at his feet.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus it's hot. Sometimes it gets 
		so hot, I wanna crawl right out of 
		my skin.

	Self-pity:

				BARTON
		But Charlie  why me? Why 

				CHARLIE
		Because you DON'T LISTEN!

	A tacky yellow fluid is dripping from Charlie's left ear and 
	running down his cheek.

				CHARLIE
		...Jesus, I'm dripping again.

	He pulls some cotton from his pocket and plugs his ear.

				CHARLIE
		...C'mon Barton, you think you know 
		about pain? You think I made your 
		life hell?  Take a look around this 
		dump. You're just a tourist with a 
		typewriter, Barton. I live here. 
		Don't you understand that...

	His voice is becoming choked.

				CHARLIE
		...And you come into MY home... And 
		you complain that I'M making too... 
		much... noise.

	He looks up at Barton.

	There is a long silence.

	Finally:

				BARTON
		...I'm sorry.

	Wearily:

				CHARLIE
		Don't be.

	He rises to his feet and kneels in front of Barton at the 
	foot of the bed.

	The two men regard each other.

	Charlie grabs two bars of the footboard frame, still staring 
	at Barton. His muscles tighten, though nothing moves. His 
	neck fans with effort. All of his muscles tense.  His face 
	is a reddening grimace.

	With a shriek of protest, the metal gives. The bar to which 
	Barton is handcuffed had come loose at the top and Barton 
	slides the cuff off it, free.

	Charlie gets to his feet.

				CHARLIE
		I'm getting off the merry-go-round.

	He takes his shotgun and walks to the door.

				CHARLIE
		...I'll be next door if you need me.

	A thought stops him at the door and he turns to face Barton.  
	Behind him the hallway blazes.

				CHARLIE
		...Oh, I dropped in on your folks. 
		And Uncle Dave?

	He smiles. Barton looks at him dumbly.

				CHARLIE
		...Good people. By the way, that 
		package I gave you? I lied. It isn't 
		mine.

	He leaves.

	Barton rises, picks up Charlie's parcel, and his script.

	THE HALLWAY

	As Barton emerges. Flames lick the walls, causing the 
	wallpaper to run with the tack glue sap. Smoke fills the 
	hallway. Barton looks down the hall.

	HIS POV

	Charlie stands in front of the door to his room, his briefcase 
	dangling from one hand, his other hand fumbling in his pocket 
	for his key.

	With his hat pushed back on his head and his shoulders slumped 
	with fatigue, he could be any drummer returning to any hotel 
	after a long hard day on the road.

	He opens the door and goes into his room.

	BACK TO BARTON

	He turns and walks up the hallway, his script in one hand, 
	the parcel in the other.

	A horrible moaning sound  almost human  can be heard under 
	the roar of the fire.

	BLACKNESS

	STUDIO HALLWAY

	We are tracking laterally across the lobby of an executive 
	building. From offscreen we hear:

				BARTON
		Fink! Morris or Lillian Fink! Eighty- 
		five Fulton Street!

	Filtered through phone:

				OPERATOR
		I understand that, sir 

				BARTON
		Or Uncle Dave!

	Our track has brought Barton into frame in the foreground, 
	unshaven, unkempt, bellowing into the telephone. In a hallway 
	in the background, a secretary gestures for Barton to hurry 
	up.

				OPERATOR
		I understand that, sir, but there's 
		still no answer. Shall I check for 
		trouble on the line?

	Barton slams down the phone.

	LIPNIK'S OFFICE

	Barton enters, still clinging on to Charlie's parcel.

	Lou Breeze stands in one corner censoriously watching Barton.  
	Lipnik is at the far end of the room, gazing out the window.

				LIPNIK
		Fink.

				BARTON
		Mr. Lipnik.

				LIPNIK
		Colonel Lipnik, if you don't mind.

	He turns to face Barton and we see that he is wearing a 
	smartly pressed uniform with a lot of fruit salad on the 
	chest.

				LIPNIK
		...Siddown.

	Barton takes a seat facing Lipnik's desk.

				LIPNIK
		...I was commissioned yesterday in 
		the Army Reserve. Henry Morgenthau 
		arranged it. He's a dear friend.

				BARTON
		Congratulations.

				LIPNIK
		Actually it hasn't officially gone 
		through yet. Had wardrobe whip this 
		up. You gotta pull teeth to get 
		anything done in this town. I can 
		understand a little red tape in 
		peacetime, but now it's all-out 
		warfare against the Japs. Little 
		yellow bastards.  They'd love to see 
		me sit this one out.

				BARTON
		Yes sir, they 

				LIPNIK
		Anyway, I had Lou read your script 
		for me.

	He taps distastefully at the script on his desk, which has a 
	slightly charred title page.

				LIPNIK
		...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't 
		wash.

				BARTON
		With all due respect, sir, I think 
		it's the best work I've done.

				LIPNIK
		Don't gas me, Fink. If you're opinion 
		mattered, then I guess I'd resign 
		and let YOU run the the studio. It 
		doesn't and you won't, and the 
		lunatics are not going to run THIS 
		particular asylum. So let's put a 
		stop to THAT rumor right now.

	Listlessly:

				BARTON
		Yes sir.

				LIPNIK
		I had to call Beery this morning, 
		let him know we were pushing the 
		picture back.  After all I'd told 
		him about quality, about that Barton 
		Fink feeling. How disappointed we 
		were. Wally was heartbroken. The man 
		was devastated. He was  well, I 
		didn't actually call him, Lou did. 
		But that's a fair description, isn't 
		it Lou?

				LOU
		Yes, Colonel.

				LIPNIK
		Hell, I could take you through it 
		step by step, explain why your story 
		stinks, but I won't insult your 
		intelligence. Well all right, first 
		of all: This is a wrestling picture; 
		the audience wants to see action, 
		drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. 
		They don't wanna see a guy wrestling 
		with his soul  well, all right, a 
		little bit, for the critics  but 
		you make it the carrot that wags the 
		dog. Too much of it and they head 
		for exits and I don't blame 'em.  
		There's plenty of poetry right inside 
		that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten 
		Feet Square".

				LOU
		"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".

				LIPNIK
		Look at "Blood, Sweat, and Canvas". 
		These are big movies, Fink. About 
		big men, in tights  both physically 
		and mentally. But especially 
		physically. We don't put Wallace 
		Beery in some fruity movie about 
		suffering  I thought we were together 
		on that.

				BARTON
		I'm sorry if I let you down.

				LIPNIK
		You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. 
		We don't live or die by what you 
		scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler 
		down. He liked you. Trusted you. And 
		that's why he's gone. Fired.  That 
		guy had a heart as big as the 
		outdoors, and you fucked him. He 
		tried to convince me to fire you 
		too, but that would be too easy. No, 
		you're under contract and you're 
		gonna stay that way.  Anything you 
		write will be the property of Capitol 
		Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will 
		not produce anything you write. Not 
		until you grow up a little. You ain't 
		no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn 
		write-off.

				BARTON
		I tried to show you something 
		beautiful.  Something about all of 
		US 

	This sets Lipnik off:

				LIPNIK
		You arrogant sonofabitch!  You think 
		you're the only writer who can give 
		me that Barton Fink feeling?!  I got 
		twenty writers under contract that I 
		can ask for a Finktype thing from. 
		You swell-headed hypocrite!  You 
		just don't get it, do you?  You think 
		the whole world revolves inside 
		whatever rattles inside that little 
		kike head of yours. Get him outta my 
		sight, Lou. Make sure he stays in 
		town, though; he's still under 
		contract. I want you in town, Fink, 
		and outta my sight. Now get lost. 
		There's a war on.

	THE SURF

	Crashing against the Pacific shore.

	THE BEACH

	At midday, almost deserted. In the distance we see Barton 
	walking.

	The paper-wrapped parcel swings from the twine in his left 
	hand.

	BARTON

	He walks a few more paces and sits down on the sand, looking 
	out to see. His gaze shifts to one side.

	HIS POV

	Down the beach, a bathing beauty walks along the edge of the 
	water. She looks much like the picture on the wall in Barton's 
	hotel room.

	BARTON

	He stares, transfixed, at the woman.

	THE WOMAN

	Very beautiful, backlit by the sun, approaching.

	BARTON

	Following her with his eyes.

	THE WOMAN

	Her eyes meet Barton's. She says something, but her voice is 
	lost in the crash of the surf.

	Barton cups a hand to his ear.

				BEAUTY
		I said it's a beautiful day...

				BARTON
		Yes... It is...

				BEAUTY
		What's in the box?

	Barton shrugs and shakes his head.

				BARTON
		I don't know.

				BEAUTY
		Isn't it yours?

				BARTON
		I... I don't know...

	She nods and sits down on the sand several paces away from 
	him, facing the water but looking back over her shoulder at 
	Barton.

				BARTON
		...You're very beautiful. Are you in 
		pictures?

	She laughs.

				BEAUTY
		Don't be silly.

	She turns away to look out at the sea.

	WIDER

	Facing the ocean. Barton sits in the middle foreground, back 
	to us, the box in the sand next to him.

	The bathing beauty sits, back to us, in the middle background.  
	The surf pounds.

	The sun sparkles off the water.

	THE END
THE BATTLE OF SHAKER HEIGHTS



                                        Written by

                                       Erica Beeney

                

               FADE IN:

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE

               Muffled by the wet green forest.

               The very earth seems to tremble.

               A RABBIT

               Darts out of a log, lifts itself on its hind legs and sniffs 
               the air.

               LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES

               VOICES and SHOUTS, closer now, mix with the rumbling WAR 
               SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and confusion.

               A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out, careless in death.

               A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees, running hunched 
               over and low, and disappear into the gray blooms of SMOKE.

               For a moment the forest takes a breath.

               Nothing but trembling leaves. Then - The RATTLE of a Jeep 
               Coming closer in fits and starts, GRINDING through low gears.

               A Willys MB appears, CRASHING through the undergrowth.

               It's driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER.

               Eighteen, if that. Not much meat on him. His insignias 
               indicate he's in the 29th Infantry.

               His face might be attractive, under other conditions.

               He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41 standard-
               issue field jacket.

                                     KELLY
                         Where the hell are those Krauts?

               To give himself courage, he SINGS Tommy Dorsey's "I'll Be 
               Seeing You [in all the old familiar places]" while maneuvering 
               the Jeep through the bushes and rocks.

               He drives straight for a fallen LOG, GUNS the engine and 
               tries to go over it.

               The Jeep's FRONT WHEELS catch on the log.

               The BACK TIRES spin.

               Kelly gets out. Takes off his M1 combat helmet and wipes his 
               face. Assesses the situation.

               He grabs a BRANCH. Jams it under the wheel, trying to lever

               the Jeep free. When --

               The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him.

               The branch SNAPS against Kelly's weight. He slips and falls 
               in the mud.

                                     KELLY
                         Shit.

               Determined, he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off on 
               foot through the forest.

               EXT. CLEARING

               Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods. Pauses against 
               a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun.

               Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN.

               But not for long, as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear around 
               the corner of it.

               Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation.

               Unaware, the Germans smoke and talk. Kelly's too far away to 
               hear them but he watches their every move.

               They're relaxed, not as on guard as they should be. Their 
               Karabiners rest slung across their backs.

                                     KELLY
                         Bingo.

               AGAINST THE TREE

               Kelly focuses himself.

               Then he shoulders his carbine.

               Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly.

                                     KELLY
                         "And so they buried Hector, breaker 
                         of horses."

               He takes his Smith & Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol belt 
               and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of the 
               guards.

               Surely he knows they can see him. He must want them to see 
               him.

               But they don't. Too busy passing nudie wallet photos.

               Halfway across the open grass, Kelly raises the pistol but 
               does not aim it.

               Just strides steadily closer, arms spread out, making himself 
               an easy target.

               Crazy as it seems, Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to get 
               himself killed.

               EXT. BARN

               Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans, FIRES into 
               the air and waves --

               -- when from behind him comes a voice.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (O.S.)
                         Eine maus findet den kase.

               Kelly whips around to face a third German, the OFFICER.

               His pistol points right into the Officer's shocked pink young 
               face. Point blank range.

               Only - Kelly doesn't fire.

               He just lowers the pistol.

               The German smiles.

                                     KELLY
                         Kill me Adolf.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Mien Prisoner!

               The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come 
               running.

               One of them yanks Kelly's hands behind his back and pushes 
               him into the barn roughly.

               Kelly doesn't struggle.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey, Siegfreid and Roy. What are you 
                         waiting for? Kill me.

               INT. BARN

               Kelly sits slumped in a chair, legs tied up. One of the 
               Germans shines a flashlight in his face. Kelly squints.

                                     KELLY
                         Come on you pussies. Let's get this 
                         over with.

               The German Officer produces a piece of paper and a fountain 
               pen.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (German accent)
                         You will write your mother. Tell her 
                         how you will die now.

               Kelly takes the pen and examines it.

                                     KELLY
                         Genuine Third Reich issue, no less. 
                         Nice work.

               The Officer pokes the paper.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         You will write. How you die alone.

                                     KELLY
                         My mother and I don't have that kind 
                         of relationship.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (hisses)
                         Write.

               Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or shouldn't 
               he - but sighs and begins writing. After a few lines, the 
               Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an 
               Infantryman.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Enough. Now you will beg for your 
                         life.

                                     KELLY
                         What don't you understand?

                                     INFANTRYMAN
                              (interrupts sheepishly 
                              in German accent)
                         The protocol says we should -

               The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker. He seems 
               to be getting a bit hysterical.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         I am the fucking protocol.
                              (to Kelly)
                         Beg!

               He and Kelly glare at each other.

               The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Beg - for - your - life!

                                     KELLY
                         You got to be kidding me.

               The Officer grabs his throat.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Silence. Now I have a little fun.

               Kelly laughs. The officer slaps him. Kelly jerks away.

                                     KELLY
                         Now that's against the rules.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (sneers)
                         There are no rules in war.

               Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German in 
               the shadows.

               Only Kelly can see him. The GI motions to Kelly "keep talking" 
               while he gets into a better position with his M-1 rifle.

                                     KELLY
                              (to Officer)
                         You've never killed anyone before, 
                         have you?

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         I shower in the blood of my victims --

               The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in exaggerated 
               pain and commence death throes.

               Quick as a flash, the GI's Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the German 
               Officer's neck, his M-1 in his other hand.

                                     GI
                         No wonder you smell so bad.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Don't shoot, please.

               The GI's eyes widen. He looks at Kelly.

                                     GI
                         Will you look at the manners on this 
                         guy?
                              (to German)
                         Remember to thank me when I kill 
                         you.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         No, really, not in the neck -

               But the GI does anyway.

               The Officer SHRIEKS, grabs at his neck, and falls.

                                     GI
                              (to Kelly)
                         You all right?

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah. My elaborate death scene wasn't 
                         going anywhere anyway.

                                     GI
                         You want me to give you a minute?

                                     KELLY
                         That's okay. They'll get me 
                         eventually. If you can't get killed 
                         in a war, when can you?

                                     GI
                         That's right. Look on the bright 
                         side.

               The GI holds out his hand.

                                     GI
                         Bart. Bart Bowland.

               Kelly takes the hand of the grinning all-American type guy.

               About his own age, but BART takes up more space.

                                     KELLY
                         Kelly. Kelly Ernswiler.

                                     BART
                         Kelly?

                                     KELLY
                              (mimics)
                         Bart?

                                     BART
                         I mean - that's Irish, right?

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (from the floor, now 
                              with a decidedly 
                              American accent)
                         Wow man, this is a really beautiful 
                         scene and all, but I have to 
                         interrupt.
                              (to Bart)
                         Why the fuck did you have to shoot 
                         that cap so close to my neck? You 
                         gave me a powder burn.

                                     KELLY
                         Listen you wienerschnitzel. You should 
                         talk. You slapped me. I'm not your 
                         bitch.

               The Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Well, what was that whole creepy 
                         death wish thing about?

                                     KELLY
                         Well it didn't work, now did it?

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (shrugs)
                         Sometimes I get so caught up in the 
                         moment.

                                     KELLY
                         And what was that ridiculous shit 
                         about making me write to my mother?

               The Officer grins.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                         Inspired, wasn't it?

                                     BART
                         Dude, you made him write to his 
                         mother? Who are you, Dr. Phil?

                                     INFANTRYMAN
                              (also with American 
                              accent)
                         Can we get up now?

               Bart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue Timex.

                                     BART
                         Might as well. There's only an hour 
                         left anyway.

               The German Officer crosses his arms.

                                     GERMAN OFFICER
                              (to Kelly)
                         Admit it. You were scared.

                                     KELLY
                              (snorts)
                         Right.

               Kelly gets up from the chair and falls over. His legs are 
               still tied.

               EXT. FOREST

               The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and some 
               other SOLDIERS, done for the day.

               Bart and Kelly walk back to the stranded Jeep.

                                     BART
                         That Willys yours?

                                     KELLY
                         Yup. Just got her. Three summers 
                         packing out at Shop Rite.

               Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs under 
               the back wheels, building up dirt.

               Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder against 
               the hood. Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the gas.

               The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud.

                                     KELLY
                         My bad. Thanks though.

               Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away.

                                     KELLY
                         See you.

               Bart stands there, dripping with mud, shocked.

               About a hundred feet away Kelly stops.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, come on.

               Bart walks towards the Jeep. Kelly backs it up again.

                                     KELLY
                         I couldn't resist.

               Bart climbs in.

                                     BART
                         Real funny, Ernswiler. You might 
                         still get your chance to die today.

               INT. DINER - DAY

               The customers are all REENACTORS. Some Yanks, some Germans, 
               a few Scottish and North African irregulars. "Boogie-Woogie 
               Bugle Boy" plays on the jukebox.

               Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together. Bart has an easy, 
               confident manner and expansive gestures. Kelly eats hunched 
               over, like someone might try and steal his food.

                                     BART
                         Character building? Those crazy guys 
                         from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock.

                                     KELLY
                              (shrugs)
                         That's what you get for invading 
                         Wisconsin.

                                     BART
                         D-Day at Kenosha was nothing. At 
                         Guadalcanal Chillicothe there was a 
                         guy who actually injected himself 
                         with malaria.

                                     KELLY
                         That's crazy.

               They both eat for a minute.

                                     BART
                         Where do you live, anyway?

                                     KELLY
                         Shaker Heights.

                                     BART
                         That explains the death wish. Me 
                         too. What street?

                                     KELLY
                         Penn Place.

                                     BART
                              (chewing)
                         Hmm, don't know it.

                                     KELLY
                         It's not technically in Shaker Heights 
                         - but I go to Shaker Heights High.

               Pause. Kelly looks at Bart.

                                     BART
                         Langely Prep.

                                     KELLY
                         Sorry to hear that.

                                     BART
                         Well, I got kicked out of Shaker 
                         Heights High because my birdhouse 
                         came unglued in honors woodshop.

                                     KELLY
                         Of course. I would have gone to 
                         Langely myself only my polo pony had 
                         the fits.

               Bart throws his napkin on his plate.

                                     BART
                         No matter.
                              (raises his voice to 
                              address the room)
                         We're all soldiers here.

                                     CROWD
                         That's right./Here, here./ Whooping, 
                         cheers, etc.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive. Bart's house 
               is fancy. A nice yard and a pool. Bart hops out.

                                     BART
                         You should come over some time.
                         Service our lawnmower.

                                     KELLY
                         I would, but then I might soil my 
                         croquet whites. You understand.

                                     BART
                         How bourgeois. Cheerio then.

               Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in spite of 
               himself.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DUSK

               Kelly's house is a also pretty nice, nothing to be ashamed 
               of. It is smaller and weirder. The flowers and bushes are 
               overgrown and strange sculptures dot the yard, some leaning 
               at precarious angles.

               Kelly washes his Jeep in the driveway.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kelly buffs the headlamps with a chamois. The Jeep looks 
               good as new. He pulls a canvas cover over it.

                                     KELLY
                         Sleep tight Hot Lips.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Kelly walks in on his dad ABE making sandwiches. A great big 
               pile of cheese and PB&J.

                                     ABE
                         Sergeant Keller! How was the war? 
                         Did we win?

               Kelly doesn't smile at this. He looks at the sandwiches and 
               puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious it's 
               downright angry.

                                     KELLY
                         Let me guess. Happy Meals for the 
                         wavy gravy wellness center?

               Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf. He looks kind. A 
               bit ill-used by life. The phrase "rode hard and put away 
               wet" comes to mind.

                                     ABE
                         As usual, your cynicism is refreshing.

               He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile.

               Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator. His back 
               tightens. He slams the door with his foot.

                                     KELLY
                         As usual, your cheerful optimism 
                         makes me ill.

               Abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly. The hostility 
               is nothing new.

                                     ABE
                              (lightly)
                         You should get that checked.

               Kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door.

                                     KELLY
                              (O.S.)
                         Sure thing, doc. Say hello to Leif 
                         Garrett for me.

               INT. ERNSWILER GARAGE - NIGHT

               Kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in.

               A family of Chinese immigrants, the Lings, paints canvases 
               at long worktables. There's a MOTHER, father MAO, grandmother 
               XIOU-XIOU, SON and DAUGHTER.

               Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in piles 
               against it. All of them are portraits of animals. Some have 
               on hats or clothes.

               Kelly's mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few strokes 
               with a paintbrush.

               Eve wears jeans. She's one of those young-looking mothers 
               Kelly's friends would have crushes on. If he had any friends.

                                     MAO
                              (to Kelly)
                         Son of Eve. You are very dirty.

                                     KELLY
                              (awkward)
                         A rough charge. You know.

                                     EVE
                              (to Kelly)
                         Don't touch anything. We have to get 
                         ready for the Starving Artist show.
                              (to Xiou-Xiou)
                         Now Nana, the gold has to be feathery, 
                         not gloppy - see?

               Eve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in French 
               court dress. Kelly looks over his mom's shoulder.

                                     EVE
                         Now you try.

               Grandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting.

                                     EVE
                              (to Kelly)
                         She loves the gold. Always overuses 
                         it. And usually her touch is so light.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Gold is the color of the sun.

               Eve moves along the row, stopping to look at the paintings 
               in progress.

                                     KELLY
                         You know why we never have anything 
                         to eat in this house?

               But Eve has stopped behind Mao's painting. She's not paying 
               attention to Kelly.

                                     EVE
                         Mao, what did we say about the eyes?

               She gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe style, 
               lots of pastels, very abstract.

               Mao looks at her quizzically.

                                     MAO
                         More - empathy?

                                     EVE
                         That's right. And didn't I tell you 
                         to put in more cacti?

                                     MAO
                              (shakes head)
                         No, no more cacti. Too busy. 
                         Simplicity is best.

               His family nods in support of this rash aesthetic statement.

               Eve rolls her eyes.

                                     EVE
                         Oh boy. I'm not having this battle 
                         with you again.

               Kelly breaks in.

                                     KELLY
                         Because your husband takes food from 
                         his own family to feed every loser 
                         druggie in Cleveland.

               Eve moves down the line.

                                     EVE
                         Well, you can always chip in here. 
                         We're ordering pizza later.

               At this the family nods and smiles to each other, pleased 
               with the news.

                                     KELLY
                         No. Some people have to work later.
                              (casual)
                         Will you drop something off at the 
                         dry cleaners for me tomorrow?

               Eve looks up at him for the first time. Takes in his filthy 
               uniform.

                                     EVE
                         Sweetie, you know what we said about 
                         paying for the war things. Nothing's 
                         changed.

                                     KELLY
                         It's the only thing I ever ask you 
                         for --

                                     EVE
                         Don't be dramatic.

                                     KELLY
                         But it's important to me.

               Eve stops at Mother Ling's painting.

                                     EVE
                         You're just going to have to find a 
                         way to pay for it yourself then, I 
                         guess.
                              (to Mother Ling)
                         No - not that way - the sky should 
                         be stormier. Angry clouds.

               Mother Ling looks up at Kelly, who's scowling. She smiles 
               and nods, understanding.

                                     KELLY
                         Why do I bother?

               Kelly leaves. Eve's busy talking.

                                     EVE
                         More brown, less blue.

               INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile.

                                     ABE
                         Now Keller, who needs that sandwich 
                         more - you or the daughter of a crack 
                         addict trying to make a new life?

               Kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich.

                                     KELLY
                         How about the son of a heroin addict 
                         trying to get ready for work?

               Kelly leaves with the sandwich. Abe sighs and picks up more 
               bread.

                                     ABE
                         That went well.

               INT. KELLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

               On the walls a poster for the Civil War miniseries next to 
               one of Led Zeppelin. Some maps. A globe. Models of fighter 
               planes and a set of old tin soldiers.

               Oh yeah, and his mom's ORIGINAL PAINTING, the one that started 
               it all, this one signed by her - a very intense looking pink 
               rabbit glaring out of the canvas with huge eyes.

               He sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring into 
               space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by piece.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Ah, the graveyard shift. Musak Steely Dan.

               Kelly unpacks cat food.

               Thousands and thousands of little cans of it. It's hard to 
               keep the rows straight on the shelves.

               SARAH, the night cashier, stands at her register. She's plain-
               looking now but she'll be beautiful later when she figures 
               out who she is.

               Not another soul in the store. Sarah wanders over to Kelly's 
               aisle as if pulled by a magnet.

                                     SARAH
                         So how'd your battle go today? I 
                         still don't understand how you could 
                         reenact the Battle of the Bulge in 
                         seventy-two degree weather.
                              (plays with hair)
                         Didn't all those guys freeze to death?

               Kelly doesn't stop working. He's got a system.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, a Port-a-John fell over on a 
                         couple of guys.

                                     SARAH
                         That's gross.

                                     KELLY
                         War is hell.

               Kelly grabs another handful of cans.

                                     SARAH
                         Then why do you do it?

               Kelly pauses. He puts two cans on the shelf very deliberately.

                                     KELLY
                         You're never more alive then when 
                         facing simulated death.

                                     SARAH
                         Really? Maybe I should try it.

               Kelly looks at her, thinks about this, and stands up.

                                     KELLY
                         You are William J. Stone of the 1st 
                         Airborne, pinned down in Noville. 
                         The Germans have the high ground and 
                         they're shelling your position 
                         heavily.
                              (starts throwing cans)
                         You're holed up in a stone barn. 
                         Sustaining heavy casualties. Running 
                         low on ammo. The cries of wounded 
                         men fill the air like the cries of 
                         hungry babies.

               Sarah covers her head, huddled behind the boxes of cat food, 
               dodging cans.

                                     KELLY
                         Your commanding officer gets hit in 
                         the face, dies. At 1 p.m. you lose 
                         radio contact with headquarters. If 
                         you withdraw, the Germans will flank 
                         the entire Allied forces arrayed 
                         along Bastogne and break the front. 
                         What do you do? What do you do?

                                     SARAH
                         Stop it!

               Kelly goes back to stocking, satisfied.

                                     KELLY
                         Battle of Bulge, the Southern 
                         Shoulder, December '44.

                                     SARAH
                         Sorry I asked.

               Sarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly makes a 
               peace offering.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. Want a snack? We got a whole 
                         shipment in of busted Oreo's.

               Sarah looks at her feet, considering whether or not to accept 
               it.

                                     SARAH
                         I'll accidentally drop a couple pints 
                         of milk and meet you over there.

               INT. DAIRY BACKROOM

               Sarah and Kelly sit on milk crates, pass the cookies back 
               and forth and get philosophical.

                                     SARAH
                         The frozen food woman came in with 
                         her kids. They must eat out of those 
                         little cardboard trays every night. 
                         One of the kids looked like cardboard.

                                     KELLY
                         Do you know we stock more flavors of 
                         cat food than we do baby food?

                                     SARAH
                         No.

                                     KELLY
                         Sixteen flavors of baby food including 
                         the toddler meals-in-ajar, thirty-
                         one flavors of cat food.

               He fishes for a cookie.

                                     KELLY
                         Next time you should tell that woman 
                         to buy her kid some cat food.

               An ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the backroom 
               with her loaded shopping cart.

                                     WOMAN
                         Is this store open? I've been waiting 
                         up front. If the store's closed, it 
                         shouldn't have a sign that says twenty-
                         four hours.

               Sarah gets up. Kelly stays right where he is, finishing a 
               cookie.

                                     SARAH
                         Sorry about that.

                                     WOMAN
                         I have a lot of coupons and I don't 
                         want to be here when they expire.

                                     KELLY
                              (to Sarah)
                         Charge her double for everything.

               Sarah smiles and hurries away.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Kelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK slung 
               over one shoulder. Besides a serious case of bedhead, he 
               looks normal.

               No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker.

               As he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices LANCE -- 
               short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and 
               his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down.

               They kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of 
               each other's mouths.

               Lance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing.

                                     LANCE
                         What the fuck are you looking at, GI 
                         Jane?

               Kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his locker.

                                     LANCE
                         No really, what makes you think you 
                         can look at me?

                                     KELLY
                         I honestly didn't know it was you. I 
                         thought it was a free preview of the 
                         Spice Channel.

                                     LANCE
                         That's pretty funny. You got dental 
                         insurance?

               Kelly closes his locker and walks away.

               Bridget wipes her mouth guiltily.

               Lance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him, grinding his 
               pelvis against hers.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Stop it.

               She walks away.

                                     LANCE
                         What? What?

               INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

               The lights are off in history class.

               The teacher MR. NORMAN shows slides on the Civil War. The 
               more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his own 
               photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials.

               Mr. Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot.

               He clicks the remote and a photo of his WIFE, crouched over 
               and wearing shorts, drinking from a garden hose appears on 
               screen.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Whoops!

               He hurries through to the next slide.

               It doesn't matter anyway. Everyone is almost asleep.

               Except Kelly, who becomes increasingly irritated the more 
               Mr. Norman talks.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         And here, at Gettysburg, the ranks 
                         of Union soldiers fought bravely on. 
                         They were willing to give their lives 
                         so that others might be free.

               Kelly shifts in his seat.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Is there a problem Mr. Ernswiler?

                                     KELLY
                         No.

               But Mr. Norman doesn't start talking again.

               He waits, looking at Kelly, smiling blandly. Until the silence 
               becomes uncomfortable. And Kelly gets mad.

                                     KELLY
                         Come on. Isn't this analysis a tad 
                         simplistic? I mean, maybe for a second 
                         grade history class, sure - but to 
                         insist on still characterizing the 
                         Civil War as some moral struggle? 
                         The soldiers were drafted - the only 
                         ones who had to fight were the ones 
                         who couldn't afford to pay their way 
                         out.
                              (losing it)
                         Why don't you talk about the Draft 
                         Riots? Where are your slides for 
                         that?

               INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

               Fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make the 
               place cozy.

               Kelly sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLMSTEAD, a well-
               groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         What gives you the idea that you can 
                         or ought to question the curriculum?

               Kelly doesn't move. He's not into this.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         Or question your teacher?

                                     KELLY
                         I know. I mean, who ever heard of a 
                         classroom dialog? Not Socrates.

               Ms. Holmstead is exasperated, but she likes him in spite of 
               herself. He's a smart cookie. She's got to change her 
               strategy.

               She leans back in her chair.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         Kelly, you're a very bright boy. But 
                         you're making some serious mistakes.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't need to. Everyone else makes 
                         them for me.

               Her chair SQUEAKS as she leans forward and looks at Kelly 
               intently.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         This anger must be masking a lot of 
                         hurt.

                                     KELLY
                         I was wondering what the tissues 
                         were for.

               Holmstead tries again. She looks down at his file.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         I see you're not going to college 
                         next year. What are your plans?

               Kelly shrugs. Holmstead searches his face for any clues.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         How do I get through to you?

                                     KELLY
                         Advertisers use status and sex to 
                         appeal to my demographic.

               She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the window 
               and gazes out at the front walkway of the school. Her face 
               clears. Something's clicked.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         I think we can come up with a 
                         punishment which might actually be 
                         more of an opportunity for you to 
                         realize your true potential.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               School's been out for a while. The first rush had already 
               left.

               Kelly comes down the front steps and starts across the parking 
               lot to his Jeep.

               Lance steps out from behind an SUV and intercepts him.

                                     LANCE
                         You upset Bridget.

               Kelly hardly stops walking.

                                     KELLY
                         Give me a break.

                         You need to apologize.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you going to do, make out 
                         with me?

               Lance runs and grabs Kelly's backpack.

                                     LANCE
                         Why are you fucking with me? You 
                         little fucker. Want to play, fuckface?

                                     KELLY
                         You just used fuck as a verb, noun, 
                         and adjective. Impressive.

               Kelly tries to start walking again but Lance has hold of 
               him.

                                     LANCE
                         Let's see what Beetle Bailey's got 
                         in his knapsack.

               Lance grabs Kelly's arm and yanks it back. Kelly still seems 
               unconcerned.

               Suddenly he pulls away, but Lance keeps hold of his backpack.

               Lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at 
               it, gleeful.

               Lance walks away towards his car. Kelly runs after him.

               Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws the 
               backpack into his SUV. They STRUGGLE for a minute, until 
               Lance pushes Kelly away, gets in the car.

               Kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as Lance 
               drives off.

               Finally, Kelly gives up. Lance turns out of the parking lot 
               and HONKS the horn.

               Kelly shakes his head.

                                     KELLY
                         Rim job.

               INT. ARMY NAVY STORE - DAY

               Kelly sifts through a pile of backpacks looking for a 
               replacement. From his post behind the counter, Bart sees him 
               and comes over.

                                     BART
                         Kelly. Hey.

                                     KELLY
                         You work here?

                                     BART
                         Just a couple days a month, to get a 
                         heads-up on the latest stuff. What 
                         are you doing?

                                     KELLY
                         Looking for a backpack.

                                     BART
                         Is that all? Don't bother. I have a 
                         couple extras at home. I could give 
                         you one if you want.

                                     KELLY
                              (beat)
                         Sure, I guess.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - DAY

               Kelly stands a bit awkwardly waiting for Bart to get the key 
               from the desk to open the door in the corner. The door finally 
               swings open.

               INT. STOREROOM

               Bart and Kelly stand between shelves piled high with war 
               memorabilia. Uniforms in vacu-pac sealed bags, weapons in 
               shoeboxes, cannonballs and tattered and gunsmoke-darkened 
               flags.

                                     KELLY
                         Very impressive.

                                     BART
                         My dad's real into hoarding.

               Kelly holds up a flask in a leather case.

                                     KELLY
                         What's this?

                                     BART
                         Grant's field flask.

                                     KELLY
                         Wow. Your dad should meet my history 
                         teacher. He sent me to the principal's 
                         office today for questioning his G-
                         rated interpretation of the Civil 
                         War.

                                     BART
                         Forget him.

                                     KELLY
                         I would, but now the principal's 
                         making me give a speech on the Civil 
                         War at an assembly.

                                     BART
                              (laughing in sympathy 
                              and amusement)
                         What is he, some kind of sadist?

                                     KELLY
                         She thinks she's doing me a favor.

                                     BART
                         Jesus, she must think you're really 
                         screwed up. Are you?

                                     KELLY
                         Depends on who you ask. Everyone's 
                         got an opinion.

                                     BART
                              (grabs box)
                         Take this. That'll shut them up.

               Bart opens the long box. Nestled inside is a leg bone with a 
               foot attached to it.

                                     BART
                         Stonewall Jackson's.

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah right.

                                     BART
                         Can you imagine that? Losing your 
                         leg and getting back up on your horse? 
                         Unbelievable. What balls.

               Kelly nods. That is balls.

                                     BART
                         He's got so much crap crammed in 
                         here he doesn't even notice when 
                         it's missing. I saw a backpack in 
                         here somewhere.

               Bart puts down the box carelessly and paws through the piles.

               INT. BOWLAND KITCHEN

               Bart and Kelly sit at the kitchen table drinking sodas, 
               waiting for MINNIE, the housekeeper, to finish making them 
               dinner.

                                     BART
                         I thought he had a couple.

                                     KELLY
                         I'd feel weird taking one out of the 
                         tomb of Tutenkamen anyway.

                                     BART
                         Trust me, you shouldn't.
                              (burps)
                         Where'd your old one go?

                                     KELLY
                         I lost it.

                                     BART
                         How?

               A pause. Kelly decides to tell him.

                                     KELLY
                         Someone took it.

                                     BART
                         You let someone take it?

                                     KELLY
                         I didn't let him. I told off some 
                         idiot --

                                     BART
                         Sounds like your mouth gets you into 
                         trouble a lot.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm telling you, it's not me, it's 
                         the world.

               TABBY, Bart's older sister comes in.

               She's older. Definitely in college, if not out. And totally 
               shockingly beautiful. Otherworldly.

                                     BART
                         Tabby, this is Kelly.

                                     TABBY
                              (to Kelly)
                         Don't give him any money, whatever 
                         you do.

                                     BART
                         Shut up.

                                     TABBY
                         All these little old ladies are 
                         looking for him in Arizona. He took 
                         their retirement money and bought 
                         defective bazookas with it.

               Kelly laughs. And looks at Tabby more closely.

                                     BART
                         Very funny. We're paying attention 
                         to you, are you happy now?

                                     TABBY
                         Finally, my life is complete. Fait 
                         accompli.

                                     BART
                              (to Tabby)
                         Minnie's making sloppy joes. Want 
                         one?

                                     TABBY
                         Sloppy joe? Sloppy no.

               She opens the fridge and gets a yogurt.

                                     TABBY
                         I have to go take a shower. Will you 
                         call me when Miner gets here?

               Tabby leaves. Kelly's distracted.

                                     KELLY
                         Who's Miner?

                                     BART
                         The fiancé.

               Bart rolls his eyes, indicating what he thinks of good old 
               Miner.

               Kelly nods, doesn't say anything.

                                     BART
                         Listen, I'm going to the flea market 
                         on Saturday. I have a line on a couple 
                         dealers. You could get a backpack 
                         there.

               Kelly glances at the door Tabby left from.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh yeah? Flea market, land of 
                         bargains.

                                     BART
                         Especially if you know who to talk 
                         to.

               Kelly looks at Bart with suspicion -- and respect.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - MORNING

               Kelly hops out of his Jeep and walks towards the front of 
               the school.

               Lance is there, hanging out with Bridget and some of his Cro-
               Magnon FRIENDS.

               He wears a WW II CAP, overseas airborne style, obviously 
               Kelly's.

                                     LANCE
                         Hey fuckface. Like my new hat? I 
                         just joined the Boy Scouts.

               The Cro-Magnons grunt approvingly at this witty repartee.

                                     KELLY
                         If you stay in it long enough, maybe 
                         you'll get your fudgepacker badge.

               Ooh. The Cro-Magnons laugh at Lance and EGG him on - "You 
               gonna take that?"/"He just called you a fag", etc.

               Lance frowns and grabs Kelly.

                                     LANCE
                         You're a regular Howie Mandel.

               Still holding on to him with one arm, he SLAPS Kelly hard 
               across the face with the other.

               Kelly's knees give a bit. Lance holds him up.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Lance!

               Lance looks over at her and releases Kelly.

                                     LANCE
                         Okay babe.

                         One day you and me will be alone. 
                         And won't that be nice?

               Kelly is hurt but covering.

                                     KELLY
                         Too bad my mom won't let me date 
                         yet.

               Kelly frowns and adjusts his clothes. Tries to re-wet the 
               dry inside of his mouth with his tongue.

               He turns slowly and trudges up the stairs.

               Sarah has been watching the whole thing from the door.

                                     SARAH
                         Why do you mess with him?

                                     KELLY
                         You're right. I should give him a 
                         break.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly watches TV in the living room. His cheek has a nice 
               bruise on it. Eve enters.

                                     EVE
                         Oh, Kelly, you're home. Good. I need 
                         you to go to the art supply store 
                         for me.

               Kelly looks at the TV.

                                     KELLY
                         Get Abe to do it.

               Eve goes to her purse and rifles through it to find her 
               wallet.

                                     EVE
                         He was going to but he had to go 
                         lead a meeting at Care House.

                                     KELLY
                         What a surprise.

                                     EVE
                         I'll make it up to you.

                                     KELLY
                         Where have I heard that before?

               Eve sighs.

                                     EVE
                         When are you going to give me a break?

               Kelly jabs at the remote.

                                     KELLY
                         Let me think - maybe when I finally 
                         forget every single word of The Little 
                         Mermaid soundtrack I'd listen to in 
                         the car waiting for him to score. 
                         No, probably when I don't prepare 
                         myself before I go into the bathroom, 
                         expecting to find him passed out on 
                         the floor.

               Eve waits through this.

                                     KELLY
                         Actually, you know what? I know I'll 
                         be able to put it all behind me when 
                         I go away to college.
                              (slaps his forehead, 
                              pretend remembering)
                         Only, I can't go because someone 
                         spent my college fund on Mexican 
                         Black Tar. So looks like I'll have 
                         to try to forget at Shop Rite, where 
                         I'll be working for the rest of my 
                         life.

                                     EVE
                         You're right. You have every reason 
                         to crawl into the corner and give 
                         up. But please just get me some paints 
                         first.

               Eve comes over to Kelly. He sighs and puts his hand out.

                                     KELLY
                         What do you need?

               She gives him the money.

                                     EVE
                         We need burnt sienna, cadmium red, 
                         and midnight blue. Two tubes of blue.
                              (looks at him)
                         What happened to your face?

               She puts her hand up but he moves away from it.

                                     KELLY
                         Forget it.

               INT. ART SUPPLY STORE - DAY

               Kelly looks through the paints, picking out tubes. He looks 
               up and sees Tabby browsing the paintbrushes.

               He's suddenly nervous. He knocks over a few cans of thinner. 
               Almost leaves.

               Instead, he gathers his courage, goes to the display opposite 
               hers and waits to catch her eye.

                                     KELLY
                         They're having a sale on glitter.

               It takes Tabby a second to recognize him.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh, hello. What happened to you?

                                     KELLY
                              (shrugs)
                         Tennis injury.

               Tabby looks at him suspiciously like she's not sure whether 
               to believe him.

               Tabby finishes with the mediums and moves onto the paints.

               Kelly follows her, staying in the opposite aisle.

                                     TABBY
                         You paint?

                                     KELLY
                         Well, you see... That's a difficult 
                         question.

                                     TABBY
                         How so?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't really feel comfortable 
                         calling anything done since the 
                         Renaissance "painting." We might 
                         have a more experimental interaction 
                         with the picture plane, but our skills 
                         have suffered from it.

               In spite of herself, Tabby laughs at this. This gives Kelly 
               more confidence. He leans over the aisle to see what she's 
               looking at.

                                     KELLY
                         You're working with acrylic. Why? 
                         Oil's much - richer.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh you're not one of those oil snobs 
                         are you?

                                     KELLY
                         Of course not.

               Kelly comes around and leans nonchalantly against the shelves, 
               knocks more things over and fumbles to replace them.

                                     KELLY
                         It's just - isn't acrylic a bit - 
                         jejune?

                                     TABBY
                         Jejune? You're jejune. How old are 
                         you anyway?

                                     KELLY
                         Older than my years.

               Tabby walks to the counter with her brushes.

                                     TABBY
                         And you paint?

               Kelly looks down and partially confesses.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, you know, my mother's kind of 
                         an artist, so -

                                     TABBY
                         That explains it.

               Tabby signs the slip and takes the bag. She walks out, Kelly 
               with her, matches her pace, talking.

                                     KELLY
                         That explains nothing. Doesn't anyone 
                         believe in innate knowledge anymore? 
                         Michelangelo was fifteen when he 
                         painted the Infanta.

                                     TABBY
                         Infantas are Spanish. Michelangelo 
                         was Italian.

               Tabby gets into her car. Kelly leans into her window.

                                     KELLY
                         Exactly. One world, one people. Just 
                         like Jesse Jackson envisioned.

               Tabby tries to conceal her smile and starts her car.

                                     TABBY
                         Well - Kelly. Nice talking to you.

               She drives away. Kelly stands there watching. Then he winces.

                                     KELLY
                         What the hell did you just say?

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly pulls up in his Jeep. He turns off the engine but 
               doesn't get out. Just sits there. He doesn't want to go in.

               EXT. FLEA MARKET - DAY

               Colored plastic flags droop in the sun.

               MILITARY STALL

               Bart sweeps his eye over everything. A SKINNY GUY wearing a 
               wife beater has some not half-bad stuff.

               Kelly, bruise faded to yellow and green, examines a glass 
               mason jar of what seems to be dirt.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                              (to Kelly)
                         That there's actual sand from Iwo 
                         Jima.

                                     BART
                         Or your sister's sandbox.

               The guy shrugs.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         Well, it don't come with no 
                         certificate of authenticity.
                              (considers)
                         I could write one up for you, I 
                         suppose. Get it notarized.

                                     BART
                         No, that's quite all right. Actually, 
                         I'm in the market for medals.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         Sure. I got a couple purple hearts. 
                         A Silver Star. DSC. Can't sell them 
                         to you though. They were gramp's.
                              (wink)

               Bart acts casual, hands clasped behind his back.

                                     BART
                         Are you sure?

                                     SKINNY
                         They have a lot of sentimental value 
                         -

                                     BART
                         Yeah. How much?

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         A lot.

               Bart pulls out a paper bag and offers it to the skinny guy, 
               who looks inside.

                                     SKINNY GUY
                         What's this?

                                     BART
                         General Ulysses S. Grant's field 
                         flask, my friend.

               Kelly is shocked. The skinny guy looks at his suspiciously.

                                     BART
                         Throw in one of those backpacks and 
                         we'll call it even.

               The skinny guy looks at Bart, and in the bag again. He goes 
               to get the backpack. Kelly's impressed by this smooth 
               exchange.

               FLEA MARKET - BETWEEN ROWS

               Kelly and Bart weave through the maze of stands. Kelly now 
               holds the backpack.

                                     KELLY
                         Buying and selling US service medals 
                         is illegal.

                                     BART
                         Exactly. That's why the resale value 
                         is so high.

                                     KELLY
                         Is that what they teach you at 
                         Langely?

                                     BART
                         Don't be so naïve. We all have our 
                         skeletons. Some of them just pay 
                         more than others.

                                     KELLY
                         And I'm not even going to ask about 
                         the flask.

                                     BART
                         Don't ask, don't tell. The army gets 
                         everything right, don't they?

               CAMPAIGN PIN STALL

               A frowsy WOMAN in a muumuu sits fanning herself in front of 
               an extensive display of pins and buttons.

                                     WOMAN
                         You boys look like Goldwater fans.

                                     KELLY
                         I've never been accused of that 
                         before.

                                     WOMAN
                         Well jeez, you don't have to be 
                         insulted.

                                     BART
                         Anything military?

               The woman considers this, her fan working back and forth 
               lazily.

                                     WOMAN
                         Fish around in that cigar box.

               Bart paws through the box. Acts casual.

                                     BART
                         What do you want for the box?

                                     WOMAN
                         Twenty dollars.

                                     BART
                         Fifteen.

                                     WOMAN
                         Don't be so hasty.
                              (fanning)
                         I got a few Geraldine Ferraro pins 
                         I'm looking to unload.

               FLEA MARKET FOOD COURT

               Kelly and Bart, now wearing the smiling black & white face 
               of Geraldine Ferraro, eat disgusting yet delicious flea market 
               food and watch a slow-motion bingo game.

                                     KELLY
                         Goldwater fan. I think that's some 
                         kind of insult.

                                     BART
                         Not at Dartmouth. Where are you going 
                         to go to school?

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not.

                                     BART
                         Ah, you have that luxury.

                                     KELLY
                         You don't?

                                     BART
                              (shrugs)
                         I didn't have much say in the matter. 
                         Everything has been decided for me 
                         since birth. I'm not whining about 
                         it. Play the hand you're dealt, right?

                                     KELLY
                         Easy for you to say. You got a royal 
                         flush.

                                     BART
                         Are you crazy? My life sucks. 
                         Everyone's always telling me what to 
                         do. You can't fight it. Go with the 
                         flow.

               They eat for a minute to the soothing sounds of the BINGO 
               CALLER: TWENTY-ONE, THIRTEEN, FOUR, SEVENTY-EIGHT.

                                     KELLY
                         What about Tabby?

                                     BART
                         She got to go where she wanted. Sarah 
                         Lawrence. Six years. She's almost 
                         done with grad school. Yale.

                                     KELLY
                         I didn't think people actually went 
                         to Yale.

                                     BART
                              (thinking)
                         I don't know. I mean, she drives off 
                         in her car in September. For all we 
                         know, she could just pull her car 
                         over in Albany and sleep there until 
                         May.

                                     KELLY
                         What do you mean?

                                     BART
                         It was a joke. Joke?

               Bart does some fake sign language to help Kelly out.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh. Is that what one of those sounds 
                         like? Somehow, I always imagined 
                         they would be funnier.

               Bart pushes Kelly, who grabs his arm like it got hurt.

                                     KELLY
                         Sarah Lawrence? Isn't that for 
                         lesbians?

               Bart shrugs.

                                     BART
                         What happened to your face?

                                     KELLY
                         Remember the backpack incident?

                                     BART
                         Same guy?

                                     KELLY
                         The one with mad cow-diseased 
                         hamburger meat for brains? That would 
                         be the one.

               Interested, Bart leans forward.

                                     BART
                         What are you going to do about it?

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not going to lower myself to his 
                         level.

                                     BART
                         Of course not. But there are 
                         alternatives

                                     KELLY
                         Alternatives?

                                     BART
                         Haven't you ever heard of the 193rd 
                         Special Operations Wing?

               Kelly shakes his head.

                                     BART
                         Well do you want to get this guy or 
                         what?

                                     KELLY
                         Yes.

                                     BART
                         All right. Let's get the fuck out of 
                         here, then.

               Bart tosses his wrapper at the trashcan. Kelly watches it 
               hit the rim and go in.

                                     BART
                              (on the move)
                         I have some things to show you.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Bart and Kelly sit amidst a spread of books, papers, and 
               electronic equipment.

                                     BART
                         Once we've gathered the intelligence, 
                         the plan will reveal itself.

                                     KELLY
                         We don't plan first?

               Bart opens a pad.

                                     BART
                         No, it limits our scope - what's the 
                         objective?

                                     KELLY
                         Humiliation. Rage. Despair.

                                     BART
                         Easy enough. 'Nam's probably our go-
                         to war for that sort of thing. I 
                         have the declassified briefs from 
                         the Phoenix Project around here 
                         somewhere.

               Bart grabs a book and starts flipping through pages.

               Tabby enters with an armful of art supplies.

                                     TABBY
                         Hey. I have some stretcher bars out 
                         in the car. Can somebody help me 
                         bring them in?

                                     BART
                         Of course we'll drop what we're doing 
                         because what you're doing must be 
                         more important.

               Bart doesn't look up. He grabs another book.

                                     KELLY
                         Sure. I mean, I'll help.

               Bart raises his eyebrow. Kelly shrugs off the look.

                                     BART
                         I'll find those reports.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Tabby drops the canvas and points at the table. Kelly dumps 
               the bars and stands there looking around.

               At the wood floors and skylights. Couch covered with a sheet.

               Painting, serious ones, with layers of paint and mysterious 
               objects stuck to them lay against the walls. They all seem 
               faded, like a vacation photo that's been through the wash.

               Kelly moves to the PAINTING on the easel.

               Very yellow and pink. Kind of looks like castles.

                                     KELLY
                         Gold. The color of the sun.

               Tabby wrestles with the bolt of canvas.

                                     TABBY
                         That's the Cleveland waterfront.

                                     KELLY
                         As the viewer, I get to decide what 
                         it is, I'm afraid. And it doesn't 
                         look a thing like it.

                                     TABBY
                         It's the light. I was playing with 
                         diffusion.

                                     KELLY
                         Well make sure you put it away when 
                         you're done with it.

                                     TABBY
                         Very funny, wiseass.

               Kelly resumes his tour of the room.

                                     KELLY
                         It must be nice to have a place like 
                         this to get away to.

                                     TABBY
                         It is.

                                     KELLY
                         What about Farmer?

                                     TABBY
                         Farmer?

               Tabby unrolls the canvas and measures lengths.

                                     KELLY
                         The boyfriend.

                                     TABBY
                              (laughs)
                         Miner? What about him?

                                     KELLY
                         Is he an artist, too?

                                     TABBY
                         No. Definitely not. Thank god.

               Kelly is silent for a while, fiddling with a clamp light.

                                     TABBY
                         You said your mom was a painter?

                                     KELLY
                         She was, well - is I guess.

               Tabby cuts the canvas.

                                     TABBY
                         What do you mean?

                                     KELLY
                         She used to be. But then my dad - 
                         wasn't working anymore so she turned 
                         it into a business. She has a family 
                         of Chinese immigrants in the garage 
                         making them for her.

                                     TABBY
                         Like Andy Warhol's Factory.

                                     KELLY
                         More like Andy Warhol's tool shed. 
                         It was nice before, though. My playpen 
                         used to be in her studio.

                                     TABBY
                         Wow. So you really grew up with it. 
                         What does, did, your dad do?

                                     KELLY
                         He's a VH-1 documentary without the 
                         music.

                                     TABBY
                         "Tragedy struck?"

               Kelly nods.

                                     KELLY
                         "And then, things took a turn for 
                         the worse."

                                     TABBY
                         Well, just wait. Those burnout types 
                         always have a triumphant comeback 
                         tour.

                                     KELLY
                         I already changed the channel.

               Tabby sits back on her heels and looks at him.

               Bart's head appears in the open door.

                                     BART
                         Christ Kelly, I let you go out on a 
                         little supply line assist and you're 
                         gone for days. Come on.

                                     TABBY
                         Have fun, boys.

                                     KELLY
                         If only it were fun. War's deadly 
                         serious, ma'am.

                                     TABBY
                              (to Bart)
                         And I used to think you were the 
                         only crazy one.

                                     BART
                         Enough with the mind pollution, Hanoi 
                         Hannah.

               Bart leaves. Kelly stands by the door. This is his only 
               chance.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm worried about you playing with 
                         diffusion unsupervised.

                                     TABBY
                         Are you?

                                     KELLY
                         Yes. I might have to come by and 
                         show you the proper safety procedures. 
                         Some time in the presence of an art 
                         prodigy would do you good.

                                     TABBY
                         I don't think I have room for a 
                         playpen in here.

                                     KELLY
                         Ouch.

               Tabby smiles. Kelly leaves.

               EXT. BOWLAND YARD - NIGHT

               Bart and Kelly walk across the yard.

                                     BART
                         So, you have a thing for my sister?

                                     KELLY
                         What? No, no.

                                     BART
                         Everybody does.

               They skirt around the pool.

                                     KELLY
                         We just have a few things in common.

                                     BART
                         Oh really, like what?

                                     KELLY
                         I can't tell you. It's my feminine 
                         side.

                                     BART
                         You don't wear women's clothes when 
                         you're alone, do you?

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama 
               bottoms and a T-shirt. The TV's on static. He sees a FIGURE 
               sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room.

               Then he stops, sighs, and backtracks. He turns off the TV.

               Then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch.

                                     KELLY
                         Dad.

               The figure doesn't move. Kelly doesn't know what to do.

                                     KELLY
                              (louder)
                         Dad?

               Kelly looks around, worried. In this house an unresponsive 
               dad isn't necessarily sleeping. Should he wake up his mom?

               He shakes the figure slightly. It rolls over, only it's not 
               his dad. It's some scabby ADDICT. Kelly yanks his hand away.

                                     ADDICT
                         Wha?

               A moment.

                                     KELLY
                         Sorry.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BACK YARD - NIGHT

               Abe sits on a lawn chair.

               Kelly comes out, unfolds another chair and sits next to his 
               dad - a good distance away.

               They both look up at the sky.

                                     ABE
                         Keller. There's a meteor shower.

               Kelly frowns.

                                     KELLY
                         A funny thing just happened. A little 
                         trip down memory lane. I thought you 
                         were on our couch, dead.

               Abe laughs.

                                     ABE
                         Oh, you mean Emmett? They didn't 
                         have an empty bed for him at Care 
                         House.

               Kelly nods, considering this.

                                     KELLY
                         Well that's one of your more brilliant 
                         ideas.
                              (anger rising)
                         Have you thought about the fact that 
                         it might be dangerous? That he might 
                         steal something, or go into cardiac 
                         arrest? Drink all our cooking wine? 
                         Which he seems to have done.

                                     ABE
                         He just needs a place to sleep for 
                         the night.

                                     KELLY
                         You're right. Besides, having him 
                         here makes it feel like home.

               Abe slams his hands down on the arms of his chair.

                                     ABE
                         I've been straight for four years, 
                         almost five. A third of your life.

               Kelly claps slowly.

                                     KELLY
                         Big whoop. I've been straight the 
                         whole time.

               Abe closes his eyes.

                                     ABE
                         I hate to tell you this, but I'm not 
                         your problem anymore.

               Kelly gets up.

                                     KELLY
                         No. That's the one thing I get to 
                         decide.

               Abe looks at Kelly.

                                     ABE
                         Let me know. I can wait.

               They look at each other. Kelly shakes his head and goes 
               inside. Abe looks up at the sky.

                                     ABE
                              (to himself)
                         Keller, there's a meteor shower.

               EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE - DAY

               In a backyard tree house next door sit Kelly and Bart, Kelly 
               looking through a pair of M3 field glasses.

                                     KELLY
                         I have the target in sight.

               BINOCULAR MATTE

               Through the twin circles Lance gets into his car in front of 
               his house.

                                     KELLY
                         I think he's leaving.

                                     BART
                         Let me see. Don't be a farb, give 
                         them up.

               Kelly hands the glasses over. Bart looks through them. Then 
               he puts them down.

                                     BART
                         The coast is clear.

               The boys looks at each other.

                                     BART
                         Let me prepare to deploy.

               Bart opens up a duffel bag and pulls out a yellow jumpsuit 
               which he puts on. Kelly looks through the binoculars.

                                     KELLY
                         Is this going to work?

                                     BART
                         We've planned for every contingency 
                         using the tried and true techniques 
                         of the last great world power.

                                     KELLY
                         Save it for the press conference.

               THE LAWN

               The boys climb down out of the tree house.

               Bart is dressed in an official-looking yellow jumpsuit with 
               telephone repairmen's tool hanging from his belt and a hard 
               hat on. Kelly carries a toolbox.

                                     BART
                         Stay low. On my signal.

               He looks at Kelly. Then he holds up one finger and gestures 
               "go." They sneak hunched over towards the fence. A LITTLE 
               GIRL comes out of the house and stops when she sees them.

               Bart and Kelly look at each other. Bart takes the toolbox 
               and gestures to Kelly by pointing at the girl and covering 
               his mouth.

               Kelly peels off towards the girl while Bart continues across 
               the lawn.

               The girl starts to SCREAM. Kelly swoops up and covers her 
               mouth with his hand. He tucks her under his arm and runs 
               towards the opposite side of the house.

               He puts the girl down, still covering her mouth.

                                     KELLY
                         We're the good guys. If you scream, 
                         the bad guys are going to come and 
                         burn down your house. Okay? So stay 
                         here and be quiet.

               The girl nods. Kelly takes his hand off her mouth and starts 
               to sneak away.

                                     GIRL
                         My dad has a gun.

               Kelly runs across the street to get a view of the front door.

               IN FRONT OF LANCE'S HOUSE

               Bart turns up the driveway and RINGS the doorbell.

               LANCE'S MOTHER opens the door. Bart confers with her briefly 
               and steps inside. The door closes behind him.

               Kelly stares so hard at the door he doesn't see the NEIGHBOR 
               come up behind him.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         Can I help you, young man?

               Kelly starts and turns.

                                     KELLY
                         I was just inspecting your lawn.

               Kelly grabs a few blades of grass.

                                     KELLY
                         Have you thought about Astroturf? It 
                         takes a lot less water to keep green. 
                         I mean, no water, technically.

                                     NEIGHBOR
                         I'm not interested.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh. I see. Okay then.

               Kelly gets up and starts to walk down the street, only - 
               Lance PULLS UP in his SUV.

               Kelly darts behind a parked car and watches Lance go into 
               the house.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, shit.

               Lance comes right back out. He forgot something in his car.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, shit.

               Kelly moves around the car, trying to keep it between him 
               and Lance.

               Bart comes down the front walk whistling and eating a cookie. 
               He smiles at Lance, now coming back up the walk.

                                     LANCE
                         Smile worker bee. I'll be your boss 
                         some day.

               Bart nods and tips his HARD HAT.

               Kelly follows him on the other side of the row of cars until 
               Lance's house is out of sight.

               Then he gets in step beside Bart.

                                     BART
                         What an asshole. His mom gave me 
                         cookies, though.

                                     KELLY
                         Did you get it done?

                                     BART
                         Don't ask stupid questions. Let's go 
                         home and listen.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - DAY

               The boys sit around an FM receiver/recorder.

                                     BART
                         It was a five-watt FM bug, so we 
                         should be in range -

               Bart FLIPS the ON switch and Lance's Mom's voice fills the 
               room.

               The boys smile with delight.

                                     LANCE'S MOM
                              (O.S.)
                         So then I told her, "Harriet, with 
                         potato salad like that it's no wonder 
                         Ray-Ray's cheating on you."

                                     WOMAN
                              (O.S.)
                         You didn't.

                                     LANCE'S MOM
                         You're right. But I was thinking it. 
                         Instead I just told her to add more 
                         vinegar next time, and -

               Kelly shakes his head as the women natter away.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't think we can use any of this.

                                     BART
                         Be patient. It's voice activated, so 
                         we'll get everything. Trust me. It's 
                         going to be great.

                                     KELLY
                         All right, then.

               Kelly gets up to leave while Bart fiddles with the knobs.

                                     BART
                         We reconnoiter tomorrow at nineteen 
                         hundred hours.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

               Abe and Eve have dinner together.

                                     EVE
                         -- And if we don't sell them there, 
                         we'll set up on the corner of Stevens 
                         and Lane, by the gas station. That's 
                         a good location.

               Eve looks at her husband and sees he's not paying attention. 
               He seems a little out of it. He's pushing his food around on

                         Are you listening to me?

                                     ABE
                         Did you make this with more chili 
                         pepper than usual?

                                     EVE
                         The same as always.

               Kelly comes in, walks through the kitchen and up the stairs.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly. Want dinner?

                                     KELLY
                              (O.S.)
                         I ate.

               His parents eat for a minute in silence. Abe winces and puts 
               down his fork. Eve smiles tenderly at him.

                                     EVE
                         One day, we're all going to be happy.

               Abe puts his hand over hers.

                                     ABE
                         That sounds nice.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bart moves around the room excitedly.

                                     BART
                         It's really too perfect, actually.

                                     KELLY
                         What? What?

                                     BART
                         I can't describe. Just hit play. 
                         It's all cued up.

               Kelly hits a button. The tape clicks ON. From the speakers 
               comes:

                                     BRIDGET
                              (recorded)
                         I told you, that makes me nervous.

                         Still. That's not a good enough 
                         reason.

                         prime time action.

                                     BRIDGET
                         But people might see us.

                                     LANCE
                         That's the point. That's what makes 
                         it sexxxy. Dangerous.

               Kelly stops the tape.

                                     KELLY
                         Dangerous.

                         Exactly.

               Bart and Kelly share a look. Kelly grins.

                                     KELLY
                         Let's draw up the plans.

                                     BART
                         I have a few notes jotted down.

               All we have to do is fill in the details and let Operation 
               Deadmeat begin.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Bridget primps at her locker while Kelly watches nervously 
               from his.

               When she starts to close the locker door, Kelly rushes towards 
               her and BUMPS into her. Her books and papers spill to the 
               floor.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh Jesus, I'm so sorry -

               He starts picking them up.

                                     BRIDGET
                         Oh, it's okay -

               She looks around. If Lance showed up it wouldn't be good for 
               either of them.

               Kelly hands her the rest of her stuff. They part ways.

               Kelly shoves a piece of paper into his pocket.

               Principal Holmstead CLICKS down the hall in her heels and 
               Kelly DUCKS into a doorway just in time. He turns and pretends 
               to look at a posted announcement as she passes.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Bart inspects Bridget's book report with a jeweler's loop.

               He swings over to a piece of stationary Kelly's working on.

                                     BART
                         She dots her I's with hearts. And 
                         her L's are loopier. The L is very 
                         important.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm working on it.

               They both crouch over the paper.

                                     KELLY
                         I feel kind of bad for her. She's a 
                         nice girl.

                                     BART
                         Sometimes collateral damage can't be 
                         avoided.

                                     KELLY
                         Stop it.

               He pushes back from the table.

                                     KELLY
                         How does that look?

                                     BART
                              (inspecting)
                         Pretty good. I think we're ready to 
                         manufacture a document.

               Kelly takes out a fresh sheet of paper.

                                     BART
                              (clears his throat)
                         Begin. "Hey Daddy. It's your birthday 
                         and you've been a very bad boy. But 
                         so has the baby. Both baby and Daddy 
                         have to get punished, only this time

               INT. LANCE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Lance, shirtless, reads aloud from the letter.

               Bart wears his school uniform and sits in the passenger seat 
               next to Kelly.

                         Yes!

                                     BART
                         Do you have everything?

               Kelly just looks at him. Bart's already asked this question.

                                     BART
                         We can't afford any errors.

                                     KELLY
                         You don't need to tell me. It's my 
                         ass on the line.

               Kelly pulls up in front of Bart's school.

               Bart turns to him and puts a hand on his shoulder.

                                     BART
                         I wish I could be there to see it.

                                     KELLY
                         You'll get the de-brief.

                                     BART
                         It's a day that will live in infamy.

                                     KELLY
                         You couldn't do any better than that?

                                     BART
                         I don't hear you coming up with 
                         anything.

               Bart hops out and salutes Kelly, who give him the thumbs up 
               in response and pulls away.

               Lance can't keep his hands off Bridget.

               INT. HISTORY CLASS

               Lance slouches into a seat next to Kelly, who drops another 
               STATIONARY NOTE into Lance's open backpack.

               Kelly watches as Lance grabs his book, sees the note, opens 
               it, and leers.

                         Mr. Palmer? May I be excused?

               Lance sneaks down the hall towards the STORAGE CLOSET and 
               whispers into the door.

               Lance turns on the light. No one there.

               But propped up on the shelf next to a vase with a rose in it 
               is another note.

               Bart crouches in the stall, looking at his watch.

               When the second hand sweeps past the twelve, he opens his 
               cell phone and punches in a number.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH, CAFETERIA/GYM - DAY

               Lunchtime. Typical bedlam. KIDS mill around.

               At one end of the cafeteria/gym is a small stage, the kind 
               pep rallies are held on.

               Lance edges his way through the crowd, making a beeline for 
               the STAGE DOOR.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH, MAIN OFFICE

               A confused Bridget stands at the SECRETARY'S desk.

                                     BRIDGET

               The crowd falls silent and turns towards the mechanical sound 
               of the STAGE CURTAIN OPENING.

               They squint from the BRIGHT STAGE LIGHTS.

               SHOCK ripples through the crowd as they take in the tableau 
               revealed to them:

               A frozen half-naked Lance on his knees before a BLOW-UP DOLL

                                     STUDENT 1
                         Look, he's got a hard on.

                                     STUDENT 2
                         Eeeeew.

               Lance stumbles off stage to HOOTS and CATCALLS, but mostly 
               hysterical LAUGHTER.

               INT. LIGHTING BOOTH

               Kelly smiles, laughs and claps his hands with delight. Then 
               he returns to military precision. He turns all the switches 
               back to how they were and uses his shirtsleeve to cover the 
               doorknob so as not to leave fingerprints.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DAD'S LIBRARY - NIGHT

               Bart pours them two glasses of his dad's scotch. He's 
               overjoyed.

                                     BART
                         You're kidding me.

                                     KELLY
                         Yup. There it was. The whole school 
                         saw it. Wasn't too impressive either.

               They raise their glasses to each other.

                                     BART
                         To Operation Mincemeat.

                                     KELLY
                         To the 193rd.

               They both take swallows of scotch. Kelly retches.

                                     BART
                         How does it feel to give better than 
                         you get?

               Kelly finishes his scotch.

                                     KELLY
                         Good. Real good.

                                     BART
                         You want some more?

                                     KELLY
                              (croaking)
                         Don't mind if I do.

                                     BART
                         That's my boy.

               The drink again. Kelly's feet are up. For the first time, he 
               looks comfortable.

               INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

               Sarah stands at her register, flipping through a magazine.

               Kelly pulls up on the ELECTRO-SHOPPER with field goggles on.

                                     KELLY
                         You know what this is?

               He puts his foot down like a kickstand.

                                     KELLY
                         Eighteen volts of pure freedom.

                                     SARAH
                         Sounds dangerous.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, it is. Unless you know how to 
                         handle it.

               Kelly runs his hand lovingly along the frame. Then he looks 
               up at Sarah.

                                     KELLY
                         You ever seen the freshly waxed floor 
                         in the produce section glistening 
                         under full florescence? It's 
                         breathtaking.

               Sarah gets on behind him.

                                     KELLY
                         Hold on tight.

               He puts his foot up and kicks it into gear.

               The Electro-shopper takes off - barely. Kelly takes the corner 
               too sharp and clips the edge of an END CAP DISPLAY of cereal 
               boxes -- they fall to the floor.

               The Electro-shopper inches forward.

                                     KELLY
                         Close call.

                                     SARAH
                         Have you been drinking?

               INT. PARENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING

               Kelly looks in at his parents, checking to make sure they're 
               still asleep.

               When he leaves ABE opens his eyes and listens to the door 
               CLOSE downstairs.

               INT. EVE'S STUDIO

               Kelly throws some paints and brushes into his backpack.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly stands awkwardly on the front stoop with his backpack. 
               Minnie opens the door.

                                     MINNIE
                         Kelly? Bart's not here, he -

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, that's all right. Actually, I'm 
                         here to see Tabby. Just to do a little 
                         painting with her.

                                     MINNIE
                         She's out back in her studio.

                                     KELLY
                         Thanks.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO

               Tabby stands barefoot in the sunlight, a palette knife in 
               her hand.

               Music's playing. Jeff Buckley. She looks over as the door 
               opens, surprised.

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly?

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. I warned you I'd come.

                                     TABBY
                         You did.

               She goes back to painting. Kelly stands there for a minute, 
               waiting for her to say something else, give him an invitation.

               She doesn't. Until she looks up and sees him standing in the 
               same place.

                                     KELLY
                         Maybe I should go --

                                     TABBY
                         Well you're here now. Go ahead. Set 
                         your canvas up. Use one of the ones 
                         in the corner.

               Kelly looks through them and picks one.

                                     TABBY
                         Brushes are in the jar. Paint's in 
                         the drawer.

                                     KELLY
                         I brought my own.

               He takes off his backpack and opens it.

                                     TABBY
                         Well then.

               Kelly busies himself pulling out paints and other supplies.

               He can't help but look at her. The light hits her hair and 
               she glows. She catches him looking.

                                     KELLY
                         Does it mess up your concentration? 
                         Me being here?

                                     TABBY
                         No.

               She turns back to her painting.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh. That's good.

               Kelly sets up his canvas.

                                     TABBY
                         Just don't talk.

                                     KELLY
                         Why would I?

                                     TABBY
                              (pause)
                         I'm kidding.

                                     KELLY
                         Right. Irony. I like that.

               Kelly feels the tubes of paint. Nervous. Squirts some color 
               out. Looks over his shoulder at her.

               He's trying to get his act together, to be cool about being 
               there, in the studio, alone with her. Trying to figure out 
               how to play it.

                                     MINER
                              (O.S.)
                         Hey! Hey babe.

               Miner opens the door. See Kelly. Smiles like the stockbroker 
               he is and crosses to him.

                                     MINER
                         Miner Webber.

               Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned shake.

               Kelly takes it.

                                     KELLY
                         Webber Miner.

               Miner looks confused.

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly. This is Kelly -

                                     KELLY
                         Kelly Ernswiler. Sorry. I -

                                     MINER
                         Quite all right.
                              (smiles as an 
                              afterthought)
                         So, what do we have here, a little 
                         painting class?

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly's a friend of Bart's. He paints.

                                     MINER
                         Oh? What's your real job?

               Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his canvas.

                                     KELLY
                         That would be stock boy at the Shop 
                         Rite. But, as President Don Kaminsky 
                         says, every employee is part owner. 
                         So you could say I'm a captain-of-
                         industry in training. Kind of 
                         capitalist larva.

                                     MINER
                         That's quite an image.

                                     KELLY
                         Only if you see the most magical 
                         part. Do you see?

                                     MINER
                         What?

               Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little.

                                     KELLY
                         One day I'll be a beautiful butterfly. 
                         First I'll have to be a pupa though. 
                         I figure I won't be going out much 
                         then. Pupa: the awkward adolescence 
                         of the insect world.

               Miner stares at Kelly. He can't tell what he might be making 
               fun of, or if it might be him.

                                     MINER
                         Whatever it takes to get you through 
                         the day.

               Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response, though 
               Miner doesn't see it. He grabs Tabby's paintbrush and pulls 
               her to him.

                                     MINER
                         I have the afternoon off. Come away 
                         with me.

                                     TABBY
                         I'm not at a good stopping point.

                                     MINER
                         Oh, come on. They'll still be here.
                              (to Kelly)
                         I know you'll still be here.

               Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps paint 
               on his canvas in exaggerated strokes.

                                     TABBY
                         I really shouldn't.

                                     MINER
                         But everyone will be coming soon. 
                         And it will get all crazy, and we 
                         won't have any time to ourselves.

                                     TABBY
                         We will. I promise.

               Tabby kisses Miner. He realizes there's no convincing her 
               and sighs.

                                     MINER
                         Like tonight? We can practice 
                         honeymoon suite.

                                     TABBY
                         Maybe. Probably.

               Miner looks at Kelly, who looks away.

               Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves.

               Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while. Kelly moves 
               around to look at his canvas from different angles, like 
               he's copying what he thinks a painter would do.

                                     KELLY
                         Is he always like that?

                                     TABBY
                         Like what?

                                     KELLY
                         Overbearing.

               Tabby stops and puts down her brush.

                                     TABBY
                         Just because he didn't want to picture 
                         you as a pupa?

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, he will - later. When he's alone. 
                         Whether he wants to or not.

               Kelly paints.

                                     KELLY
                         Not that though. How he wanted you 
                         to stop.

                                     TABBY
                         He wants to be with me. What's so 
                         bad about that?

                                     KELLY
                         Just because some one wants to be 
                         with you doesn't mean they're good 
                         for you.

               Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting. He has a 
               hard time making eye contact with Tabby.

                                     KELLY
                         No one should ever ask you to stop. 
                         If you stop, you might not be able 
                         to start again. Or you might start 
                         again, only things will be different.

                                     TABBY
                         Well, that's sweet -

                                     KELLY
                         It's not sweet, actually. It's just 
                         the truth.

                                     TABBY
                         Hey, I can take care of myself.

               She picks up her brush.

                                     KELLY
                         When's the wedding?

                                     TABBY
                         At the end of the month. But don't 
                         ask me about it. It makes me nervous.

               Kelly looks at her seriously.

                                     KELLY
                         Why? Is something wrong?

                                     TABBY
                         No.

               Awkward silence.

                                     TABBY
                         What are you painting?

               Kelly stops and sighs, now back in serious artist mode.

                                     KELLY
                         Really, there are so many layers of 
                         - imagistic symbolism - that I really 
                         don't feel comfortable summing it 
                         up, but, well - it's a recurring 
                         dream image. A mermaid riding a rocket 
                         ship.

               Tabby stops painting.

                                     TABBY
                         How?

                                     KELLY
                         What do you mean, "how?" Sidesaddle. 
                         She's riding it sidesaddle. She's 
                         got a fish tail, for chrissake. I 
                         haven't decided yet if she's got 
                         scuba gear on or not.

                                     TABBY
                         Do you have any idea what you're 
                         talking about?

               Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an artist's 
               gesture.

                                     KELLY
                         Does that matter?

                                     TABBY
                         Well, some people actually say what 
                         they really think.

                                     KELLY
                         What if they don't know what they 
                         really think?

                                     TABBY
                         It doesn't matter. It's called being 
                         yourself.

                                     KELLY
                         Sounds boring.

                                     TABBY
                         Not boring. Scary and wonderful and 
                         exciting.

               Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette. His gestures 
               slow down. He's taking this in. Then he shakes it off.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. I'm trying to create here. Stop 
                         distracting me.

               INT. EVE'S STUDIO - NIGHT

               Kelly comes in to return the art supplies.

               Xiou-Xiou's alone working. She looks up and smiles at Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         Mom's got you working late?

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         No.

               Kelly walks over and sees what she's working on. A beautiful 
               spare Chinese landscape.

                                     KELLY
                         Wow. You're really good. Why do you 
                         make those stupid animals for mom?

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Each painting is a lesson. Here -

               She gets out a piece of paper for him.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm making a lot of art these days. 
                         I guess that means a lot of lessons.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Each line has a whole drawing 
                         contained in it. Each drawing has a 
                         whole life contained in it.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, that's all?

               Kelly watches her for a minute, the delicate whoop and swirl 
               of her strokes.

               He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xiou's 
               restrained and confident movements.

               Eve leans against the doorframe.

                                     EVE
                         Hey you two. I'll try not to act 
                         surprised. It might spoil the moment.

               Kelly puts down the paintbrush.

                                     KELLY
                         I can't do this. I have to go.

                                     EVE
                         Keller, I think I'm missing some art 
                         supplies. Have you seen them around 
                         the house?

               Kelly avoids her eyes as he leaves.

                                     KELLY
                         No, I haven't.

                                     EVE
                         I don't know what to do with him.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         You son is not yet cooked. Give him 
                         time.

               Eve looks over Xiou-Xiou's shoulder.

                                     EVE
                         When are you going to let me give 
                         you your own show? We could do it 
                         for real.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         No problem. When you offer me an 
                         eighty-twenty split.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Kelly eats with the Bowlands - Bart's mom, MATHILDA, his dad 
               HARRISON, and Tabby and Bart.

               The Bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good Wasp 
               family.

                                     BART
                              (to Harrison)
                         -- But I told you I want to take 
                         German --

                                     HARRISON
                         German's a Cold War language. You 
                         can't get any kind of State Department 
                         position without more diverse 
                         linguistic training than that. You'll 
                         take Chinese.

               Bart frowns.

                                     HARRISON
                         Are we on the same page?

                                     BART
                              (mutters)
                         Same page.

               Everyone eats in silence.

                                     MATHILDA
                              (to Tabby)
                         So darling, when are you going to 
                         bite the bullet and do the seating 
                         arrangement?

               Tabby puts down her fork.

                                     TABBY
                         I can't deal with that stuff, ma. I 
                         don't care who sits next to whom. I 
                         should have eloped.

                                     KELLY
                         After all, Mrs. Bowland, sometimes 
                         when you bite the bullet, it explodes 
                         in your mouth.

               Mathilda looks surprised. This could go either way.

                                     MATHILDA
                              (tentatively)
                         Why, I've never thought about it 
                         before but that is a rather strange 
                         expression, isn't it? You wouldn't 
                         say, "Sooner or later you've got to 
                         put the grenade in your pants," would 
                         you?

                                     HARRISON
                         But have you ever noticed how in 
                         movies they always bite the grenade 
                         before they throw it?

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah, but they never take a bite out 
                         of their pants.

               Everyone but Bart LAUGHS.

               Tabby throws Kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of 
               a conversation she didn't want to have.

                                     MATHILDA
                         What an unusual conversation! Do you 
                         have similar discussions at the dinner 
                         table with your family, Kelly?

                                     KELLY
                         Basically. I ask why all the furniture 
                         is missing and my Dad reminisces 
                         about dropping acid and watching 
                         Neil Armstrong walk on the moon.

               All but Bart LAUGHS again.

                                     TABBY
                         He talks about art.

                                     BART/MATHILDA
                         You do?

               Kelly looks down at his plate.

                                     KELLY
                         My mother's kind of an artist, so -

                                     HARRISON
                         You come from a creative family, do 
                         you?

               Mathilda salts her food.

                                     MATHILDA
                         I wish my boys would talk to me about 
                         my passions. I can't get them anywhere 
                         near the subject of my garden.

                                     KELLY
                         I noticed your magnolias. Very fine 
                         specimens.

                                     MATHILDA
                         They are fine, aren't they?

               Mathilda beams.

                                     BART
                              (ironic)
                         Is there nothing you can't discuss?

               If anyone notices the slight edge to Bart's voice, they ignore 
               it.

                                     HARRISON
                         Here, Kelly, try a bit of these leeks. 
                         Minnie has a way with the white sauce.

               INT. BART'S ROOM

               Kelly and Bart play PlayStation II "Medal of Honor" in Bart's 
               bedroom. Bart is sulking, almost imperceptibly.

                                     BART
                         My dad has this friend who's a 
                         director. He's shooting a documentary 
                         for the History Channel.

                                     KELLY
                         Cool.

                                     BART
                         He needs some guys to do a reenactment 
                         of some European theater battles for 
                         him.

               Kelly stops playing and looks at Bart.

                                     KELLY
                         We're going to be on the History 
                         Channel?

               Bart's eyes stay on the screen.

                                     BART
                         I haven't asked you yet.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh, come on.

               Kelly jabs at his controller.

                                     BART
                         Well, if you want to. Next weekend. 
                         But you have to take it seriously.

               Kelly gives Bart a derisive glance.

                                     KELLY
                         What do you mean? Of course I will.

               The flickering TV light illuminates Bart's pinched look.

                                     BART
                         From what I've seen, you play fast 
                         and loose with your characterizations. 
                         This has got to be straight up.

               This annoys Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not "fast and loose." I play the 
                         emotional truth. I make it real.

               Bart glances at him.

                                     BART
                         Like back in the dining room?

                                     KELLY
                         What does that have to do with it?

               Bart shakes his head.

                                     BART
                              (mimics)
                         "I noticed your magnolias. Very fine 
                         specimens." That was real?

               Kelly's video game character dies. He drops the controller.

                                     KELLY
                         What is this about?

                                     BART
                              (shrugs)
                         You just seem to have your own agenda, 
                         that's all.

               Bart plays on. He's keeping a lid on everything while Kelly 
               gets more and more agitated.

                                     KELLY
                         My own agenda? What other reason is 
                         there to do anything?

                                     BART
                         I'm just saying. I know the difference 
                         between fantasy and reality.

               Kelly looks at Bart in disbelief.

                                     KELLY
                         Are you saying I don't?

               Bart won't meet his eyes.

                                     BART
                         I don't know.

               Bart pauses the game.

                                     BART
                         Why didn't you tell me your dad was 
                         a burn-out?

               Kelly gets up and grabs his jacket.

                                     KELLY
                         Why do you steal from yours?

               He leaves. Bart un-pauses the game and continues playing.

               INT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Kelly drinks from the fountain and wipes his mouth on his 
               sleeve.

               Principal Holmstead's smiling face greets him when he 
               straightens up.

                                     PRINCIPAL
                         Kelly! I told some of your teachers 
                         about your presentation. We're all 
                         really looking forward to it.

               Kelly frowns at the Principal's back as she CLICKS away.

               Sarah appears. They walk down the hall together.

                                     SARAH
                         What presentation?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't want to talk about it. As a 
                         matter of fact, do me a favor and 
                         pretend you never heard anything 
                         about it.

                                     SARAH
                         Okay. Um.

                                     KELLY
                         What, Sarah?

                                     SARAH
                         It's nothing. I -

               Kelly starts to pull ahead.

                                     SARAH
                         I have an extra ticket to Aerosmith 
                         this weekend.

                                     KELLY
                         Aw Sarah, that's really great, I 
                         mean. It's just that - I'm busy.

                                     SARAH
                         Oh. Yeah, I figured. Okay. I'll see 
                         you in the dairy section, though.

                                     KELLY
                         Right.

               She stands there looking lost.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly smoothes the cover over his Jeep. Bart pulls up to the 
               curb in his BMW.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you doing here?

                                     BART
                         I tracked you down. There's someone 
                         I'd like you to meet.

               INT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY

               A few OLD SOLDIERS sit sunning in chairs in the industrial 
               feeling living-room.

               Bart and Kelly sit across from CHARLIE HAYES, an old black 
               guy, playing dominos.

                                     CHARLIE
                              (to Kelly)
                         Are you one too?

                                     KELLY
                         Yup.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And what do you see in that?

                                     KELLY
                         Living, dying, camaraderie, bravery 
                         - the big stuff. Things we don't 
                         have anymore.

                                     CHARLIE
                         I see.

               Charlie sorts his tiles and scowls. He leans in to Kelly's 
               face, giving him the eye.

                                     CHARLIE
                         And do you think it's brave getting 
                         trench foot and syphilis, eating 
                         another ration of spoiled frank and 
                         beans out of a dented can?

               Kelly is taken aback by this.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, no -

               Charlie leans back and nods, thinking about Kelly's response. 
               He no longer seems angry.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Yeah, that wouldn't be much fun, 
                         would it?

                                     KELLY
                         No, sir.

               Charlie sets down a tile and pulls at his chin.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Parts of it were kind of fun though. 
                         I got separated from my platoon and 
                         lived for two weeks in the forest of 
                         the Ardennes living off what I could 
                         kill.
                              (pause)
                         I felt very close to the land.

               Bart gives Kelly a significant look. Kelly doesn't notice.

               He's looking closely at Charlie.

               EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

               Kelly sits in the car. Bart pumps gas. They talk through the 
               window.

                                     BART
                         I met him when my mom made me go 
                         around caroling with the Youth Group.

                                     KELLY
                         You don't really believe that stuff 
                         about Berlin? And Hitler's compound?

                                     BART
                         Does it matter?

                                     KELLY
                         Of course it matters. Doesn't the 
                         truth matter?

               Bart grins.

                                     BART
                         I don't know. You tell me.

               Kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.

                                     KELLY
                         I want a drink. Let me borrow a couple 
                         bucks.

                                     BART
                         I told you not to play him for money.

                                     KELLY
                         I was trying to be nice. He's your 
                         friend.

               Bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.

                                     BART
                         Exactly. You should know better. 
                         What do you want.

                                     KELLY
                         Mountain Dew -

               Just then he glances towards the gas station and sees EVE, 
               set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. She's got the van parked 
               there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around 
               on display.

                                     KELLY
                         -- Oh shit.

               But Eve has seen him. She shields her eyes with her hand and 
               calls to him.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly!

               Kelly backtracks towards the car.

                                     BART
                         That woman's calling you.

               Eve walks over to them. Kelly can't get out of it.

                                     KELLY
                              (low)
                         Bart. Meet my mom.

               Eve smiles brightly.

                                     EVE
                         What a nice surprise. It's so nice 
                         to finally meet you.

               Bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just 
               like he's been taught to.

                                     BART
                         Likewise. So, doing a little business?

                                     EVE
                         A little is right. But I work it as 
                         much as I can.

               Eve laughs.

               Kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot. Eve looks at both 
               of them.

                                     EVE
                         So, what have you boys been up to?

                                     KELLY
                         Bart took me to meet his friend 
                         Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home.

                                     EVE
                         Charlie at the Old Soldiers' Home?

                                     KELLY
                         You don't know him.

                                     EVE
                         You boys should swing by Care House. 
                         There are some Vets there.

                                     KELLY
                         We can't.

                                     EVE
                         Oh. Well - okay.

               Eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van.

                                     EVE
                         I should go. But you boys should 
                         come over to our house some time.
                              (to Bart)
                         I know your family must get tired of 
                         him.

               Kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents 
               entertaining Bart.

                                     BART
                         Not at all. But I'd love to, anyway.

               Eve looks at Kelly. Then she runs back over to the van.

                                     KELLY
                         There you go. Now you know everything.

                                     BART
                         What's your problem? She's pretty 
                         cute.

               Kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car.

                                     BART
                         Don't you want your soda?

                                     KELLY
                         Forget it.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Kelly watches Bart pick through parts of his uniform.

               After the encounter with mom, he's retreated into himself.

                                     BART
                         So filming's on Saturday. Can you 
                         make it?

                                     KELLY
                         Are you kidding?

                                     BART
                         Good. It's gonna be really cool. 
                         He's got an explosives expert coming.

               Kelly doesn't say anything.

                                     BART
                         What's up?

               Kelly runs his hand through his hair. He can't bring himself 
               to say what's really on his mind.

                                     KELLY
                         Remember that stupid speech?

               Kelly picks up Bart's Colt and sights with it. Bart frowns.

               He knows Kelly's avoiding the real stuff.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm supposed to give it next week.

               Bart polishes his combat boots.

                                     BART
                         Maybe you should talk to my dad about 
                         it.

                                     KELLY
                         You think he'd go for that?

               Bart keeps his head down, polishes intently.

                                     BART
                         Of course. He loves you. He was 
                         talking the other day about helping 
                         you out.
                              (ironic)
                         Want to go to Dartmouth?

                                     KELLY
                         Are you serious?

                                     BART
                         He was. If you applied for Spring 
                         Semester, he could "pull some 
                         strings."

                                     KELLY
                              (shakes his head slowly)
                         I don't think that would work for 
                         me. Considering -- my background.

                                     BART
                         Yeah, probably not.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm not properly socialized. I 
                         wouldn't fit in.

               Bart checks his bandoleer and cartridges.

                                     BART
                         That's bullshit.

                                     KELLY
                         No, it's not.

                                     BART
                         Tell that to my family. They're like 
                         your fucking fan club.

               Bart pauses, darts his eyes at Kelly.

                                     BART
                         Even Tabby likes you.

                                     KELLY
                         So much she ratted me out to you.

                                     BART
                         Well, she's inviting you to the 
                         wedding.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh.

               Bart watches Kelly's face.

                                     BART
                         But you probably won't enjoy that 
                         much, will you?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about. Weddings? I love weddings. I 
                         always get drunk and make out with 
                         someone's cousin.

               Bart throws his olive drab socks at Kelly's head.

                                     BART
                         Good, I'll call mom's nephew Fletcher 
                         and tell him to expect a little 
                         action.

                                     KELLY
                         Fletcher, eh?

                                     BART
                         He's twelve. Let me give some advice. 
                         He's very into sharks at the moment.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT

               Kelly waves to Minnie and goes out the front door.

               There he pauses, trying to decide what to do. Then he scowls.

               He goes around the corner. Towards Tabby's studio.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO

               Tabby sits on the couch facing away from the door. Kelly 
               enters.

                                     KELLY
                         Why did you tell --

               Tabby turns toward him. She's crying.

                                     KELLY
                         What? Oh, I'm sorry.

               He knows he should leave, but Kelly just stands there.

               Kelly runs his hand along his pants in a nervous gesture.

               Tabby dabs at her face.

                                     TABBY
                         Miner and I broke up.

               Beat.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm sorry.

                                     TABBY
                         Yeah.

                                     KELLY
                         Honestly? I didn't think you two 
                         were right for each other.

                                     TABBY
                         You did, huh?

               Kelly walks over to her painting.

                                     KELLY
                         Like this painting. Stare at it too 
                         long and you can't see it anymore. 
                         But if someone else sees it for the 
                         first time, they can tell exactly 
                         what it is.

                                     TABBY
                         I don't need any more bullshit right 
                         now.

               Kelly stops, taken aback. He walks away from the painting.

                                     KELLY
                         He could never understand you.

                                     TABBY
                         I'm not as complicated as you think.

               Kelly walks to the window and looks out.

                                     KELLY
                         I never said you were complicated.

               Tabby laughs/cries at this.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh.

                                     KELLY
                         He just wasn't the right one.

               Tabby nods. She's starting to calm down a little.

                                     TABBY
                         There's more to it than that.

               Tabby looks at her shredded tissue. Kelly sits down on the 
               couch next to her.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm really sorry. I really am.

                                     TABBY
                         Thanks.

               Kelly pats her knee awkwardly.

                                     KELLY
                         Don't cry.

               Tabby turns her face to Kelly's.

                                     TABBY
                         You like me, don't you?

                                     KELLY
                         Of course.

               Tabby closes her eyes.

                                     TABBY
                         No, I mean -- you like me.

               Kelly looks scared. He wants to retreat. But he calms himself 
               down.

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah. I think you're amazing.

                                     TABBY
                         Well, do something.

               Long pause. Then -- Kelly kisses her. She kisses back and 
               they fall against the couch together.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     BART
                              (O.S.)
                         All right, all right. I'm going.

               Bart comes out in his pajamas to turn off the sprinkler. He 
               looks up and freezes.

               Kelly comes out of Tabby's studio. He shuts the door carefully 
               and walks around the pool.

               Kelly doesn't see Bart.

               Bart doesn't say anything. He just watches Kelly go.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly throws parts of his soldier's kit onto his bed from 
               corners of the room. The canteen underhand. The Jeep cap as 
               a free throw. This is the best day of his life.

               Until he finds his uniform crumpled up behind the door, still 
               crusted with mud.

                                     KELLY
                         Damn it. Damn it.

               He flops on his bed. But he can't help it. Soon he's smiling 
               again. He gets up, gathers up the uniform, and tears out of 
               the room.

               INT. KITCHEN

               Kelly comes down the stairs two at a time, singing.

               Eve and Abe watch surprised from the table. Abe looks pale.

                                     KELLY
                         What?

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, BART'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bart sits in his desk chair, frowning.

               Mathilda knocks and opens the door.

                                     MATHILDA
                         Minnie's starting dinner. Is Kelly 
                         coming over?

                                     BART
                         Not tonight, ma.

               Mathilda pauses and looks at her son.

                                     MATHILDA
                         Okay, then.

               EXT. BATTLEFIELD - DAY

               An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR and CAMERAMAN unload equipment from a 
               van.

               The DIRECTOR looks off into the distance, trying to visualize.

               Kelly pulls up next to the van. He wears a spotlessly clean 
               uniform.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Are you with the 101st or the 82nd?

                                     KELLY
                         Well, 82nd today. It's not my usual 
                         division. Technically, my patches 
                         indicate -

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Whatever. Make yourself comfortable. 
                         We'll be a while setting up. Some of 
                         the other boys are over by craft 
                         service.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh?

               Kelly doesn't go anywhere.

                                     DIRECTOR
                         The snack table. It's over there. 
                         Someone will come get you when we're 
                         ready.

                                     KELLY
                         Right. Is Bart Bowland here yet?

                                     DIRECTOR
                         Bart? Oh, Harrison's son. I don't 
                         know.

                                     KELLY
                         Ok. Thanks.

               CRAFT SERVICE

               Kelly and a half dozen other SOLDIERS stand or sit in the 
               grass around the table. They talk and rest on their backpacks.

               A MAKEUP ARTIST makes the rounds.

                                     MAKEUP ARTIST
                              (to Kelly)
                         And you are?

                                     KELLY
                         Kelly Ernswiler, private first class.

                         All right, Kelly. Let's take a look 
                         at you.

               She gets out some pomade and runs a comb through his hair, 
               slicking it back.

                         That's it, handsome.

               Kelly grins. When she walks away he messes up his hair again.

               He scans the crowd. No Bart.

               The A.D. walks over.

                                     A.D.
                         Okay, everyone. We're going to start 
                         positioning. Then we'll go through a 
                         few rehearsals.
                              (points at soldiers)
                         You, you and you - go over there by 
                         that tree. You and you guys, behind 
                         the hill.
                              (looks at clipboard)
                         Okay, who's got the Jeep?

                                     KELLY
                         That MG? She's mine.

                                     A.D.
                         Great. We'd like to use it. Can you 
                         drive it beyond the hill over there?

               Kelly tries to act casual.

                                     KELLY
                         Sure. I don't think that would be a 
                         problem.

               He walks towards his Jeep and pauses.

                                     KELLY
                         Have you seen Bart Bowland? Has he 
                         checked in?

                                     A.D.
                         Don't know. We've got enough people. 
                         It doesn't matter.

               Kelly nods, wondering a bit. But it's soon forgotten.

                                     KELLY
                              (to Jeep)
                         Hot Lips, old girl, you're going to 
                         be famous.

                                     A.D.
                              (yells)
                         Okay people. Listen to my voice. 
                         From now on, you do whatever this 
                         voice says. Take your place.

               BEHIND THE HILL

               Kelly waits with his rifle next to his Jeep, bored.

               He sees a FIGURE in the shadows of the trees.

               He raises his rifle and points it at the figure.

                                     KELLY
                         Password.

               Bart steps out of the barn.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey! Where the hell have you been?

                                     BART
                         No where.

                                     KELLY
                         They put you over here with me? That's 
                         great. I think we'll get some close-
                         ups. They want me to drive old Lippy. 
                         Isn't that awesome?

               Bart doesn't say anything.

                                     KELLY
                         What the hell's your problem?

                                     BART
                         I ought to fucking kill you.

                                     KELLY
                         What?

                                     BART
                         You had to do it.

               Kelly shakes his head, avoiding Bart's eyes, trying to keep 
               it normal.

                                     KELLY
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BART
                         You just do whatever the fuck you 
                         want. And consequences don't matter, 
                         do they?

                                     KELLY
                         Are you out of your mind?

               Bart looks at Kelly. Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army 
               uniform.

                                     BART
                         What the fuck do you think she's 
                         going to do, run off with you?

               The blood rises to Kelly's face.

               But he still won't look at Bart.

                                     BART
                         You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. 
                         She's a Yale grad student. Talk about 
                         living in a fucking fantasy world.

               Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle.

                                     KELLY
                         No. You'd rather have me be miserable 
                         like you are.

               Bart comes closer. Uncomfortably close.

                                     BART
                              (biting sarcasm)
                         Once again, you've displayed your 
                         uncanny ability to nail the truth of 
                         a character.

               Kelly finally raises his head.

               And looks Bart right in the eyes.

                                     KELLY
                         Stop talking out your dad's mouth 
                         and use your own for once.

               Bart lunges at Kelly.

               EXT. FILM SHOOT

               The camera's set up.

               The groups are in position.

               The A.D. stands by the cameraman.

                                     A.D.
                         Standby for rehearsal. Cue the 
                         explosion.

               GRAY CLOUD EXPLODES

               In the field. Soldiers leap out of trenches.

                                     A.D.
                         Cue the Jeep.

               Nothing happens.

                                     A.D.
                         Cue the Jeep. Cue the fucking Jeep!

               The A.D. shakes his head.

               BEHIND THE BARN

               The A.D. comes around the corner followed by the cameraman.

               Bart and Kelly roll around on the ground.

                                     A.D.
                         What the H. Christ is going on over 
                         here?

               Bart and Kelly continue to fight.

                                     A.D.
                              (to cameraman)
                         Hey, roll this. Get this. Are you 
                         getting this?

               The cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films.

               Kelly finally pushes Bart off him, gets in his Jeep and drives 
               away.

                                     A.D.
                              (to cameraman)
                         Follow him. Are you getting it?

               Bart sits on the ground, out of breath.

                                     A.D.
                         We can use this. We'll cut it 
                         together.

               The A.D. directs the camera at Bart.

                                     A.D.
                         Get close on him.

               Bart pushes the camera away.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY

               Kelly lays in bed staring at the ceiling. There's a cut across 
               his eyebrow.

               Eve comes in carrying her car keys and sits on the bed.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't want to talk about it.

                                     EVE
                         Well, you're going to have to. Your 
                         father's at the hospital.

                                     KELLY
                         Which one of his loser friends ended 
                         up there?

               Eve plays with her keys. Then she stops.

                                     EVE
                         They think he has stomach cancer.

               Kelly feels the sensation of falling, like a dream.

               Then he snorts and rolls over, away from his mom.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh this is just perfect.

               Eve looks at the back of Kelly's head. She's tired but still 
               trying to deal.

                                     EVE
                         Why would you say something like 
                         that?

                                     KELLY
                         Because it seems to fit.

                                     EVE
                         "Seems to fit." Do you understand 
                         what I just said?

               Kelly gets up. Puts his feet on the floor. His shoulders are 
               slumped.

                                     KELLY
                         Why, do you want to say it again?

                                     EVE
                         Kelly -

                                     KELLY
                         I have to go to work.

               He gets up and holds the door open for her. Eve looks at 
               him, heart heavy. She leaves.

               Kelly sits on the bed. Then he looks at the rabbit painting.

               He grabs it off the wall and SLAMS it backwards against the 
               floor so he doesn't have to look at it.

               The painting falls back against the bayonet fixed to Kelly's 
               rifle and TEARS.

               He KICKS it.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Kelly angrily wrestles with giant boxes of paper towels.

               He RIPS open the box and they roll everywhere.

               Sarah watches from checkout. She comes over to help him pick 
               them up.

                                     SARAH
                         I forgot to tell you this box was 
                         booby-trapped.

               Kelly doesn't say anything.

                                     SARAH
                         The concert was lame. The opening 
                         act singer ripped his leather pants 
                         during a stupid dance routine and 
                         stormed off stage.
                              (pause, looks at his 
                              cut)
                         Are you okay?

                                     KELLY
                         No.

                                     SARAH
                         Lance?

                                     KELLY
                         No.

               Kelly gathers an armful of paper towels.

                                     KELLY
                         Listen, I'm busy.

                                     SARAH
                         Sure. I understand.

                                     KELLY
                         I doubt it.

               Sarah puts a couple of rolls on the shelf.

                                     SARAH
                         Um, I don't have a perfect life, if 
                         that's what you're asking.

               Kelly stops what he's doing.

                                     KELLY
                         No, Sarah, actually, I'm not asking. 
                         I never ask you anything but you 
                         just talk anyway. Have you ever 
                         noticed that?

               Sarah drops the rolls she had in her hands.

                                     SARAH
                         Fuck you.

               She leaves. Kelly shakes his head.

               INT. TABBY'S STUDIO - MORNING

               Kelly, still in his work clothes, comes in without knocking.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey, I hoped you were up -

               He stops when he sees Tabby and Miner sleeping together on 
               the couch.

               Tabby opens her eyes.

                                     TABBY
                         Kelly?

               Kelly goes and takes his painting off the easel.

                                     KELLY
                         I just came to get this.

               Kelly leaves.

               Tabby follows Kelly across the yard.

                                     TABBY
                         Hey.

               Kelly stops and turns around.

                                     KELLY
                         I guess the wedding's back on.

                                     TABBY
                         We talked.

               Tabby smiles sadly.

                                     TABBY
                         I'm really sorry.

                                     KELLY
                         Don't be.

               They stand there in the yard. Tabby wraps her arms around 
               herself.

                                     KELLY
                         My dad's got cancer.

               Tabby looks at Kelly, pained.

                                     TABBY
                         Oh, Kelly.

               She takes a step towards him. He backs up.

                                     KELLY
                         I guess we all get what we deserve.

               Kelly looks at Tabby for a second, then turns and walks away.

               EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

               Kelly drives along an open stretch of road. He throws the 
               painting out of the Jeep.

               He comes to a turn and takes it much too fast.

               The Jeep SKIDS, teeters on two wheels, and goes over the 
               embankment.

               BOTTOM OF DITCH

               Steam trails up from the Jeep's radiator. The front end is 
               completely smashed.

               Kelly bangs his fist against the steering wheel.

                                     KELLY
                         Stupid bitch.

               Then he calm himself, gets out, and starts walking.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               Kelly rides an old bike up to the bike rack and locks it.

               INT. HISTORY CLASS

               Kelly comes in late.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Kelly! There you are. I was just 
                         telling the class about our special 
                         treat today. Mr. Ernswiler is going 
                         to be giving the three first-period 
                         history classes a little talk about 
                         the Civil War.

               Kelly closes his eyes. He had forgotten - or tried to forget.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Let's all make our way in an orderly 
                         fashion down to the auditorium, shall 
                         we?

               The class bolts for the door.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Orderly, I said orderly.

               Mr. Norman looks at Kelly pleasantly.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Well, what are we waiting for? I'm 
                         so looking forward to hearing your 
                         views.

               INT. AUDITORIUM

               Kelly sits in a chair on the stage next to Mr. Norman.

               A scattering of KIDS sit out in the auditorium.

               Principal Holmstead stands at the podium.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         For those of you who haven't had the 
                         chance to get to know Kelly, you 
                         should know he has a very interesting 
                         hobby. He takes part in reenactments 
                         of World War II battles right here 
                         in Ohio.

                                     AUDIENCE KID
                         I did that too. When I was seven.

               Scattered LAUGHTER. Kelly frowns.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                         He has an unusual first-hand knowledge 
                         of history. We recently discovered 
                         that this extends beyond World War 
                         II to the Civil War, which he is 
                         going to discuss with you today. 
                         Kelly?

               Kelly rises to scant applause. He stands at the podium, 
               looking out at the crowd.

               He looks down and thinks. He looks back up. The silence 
               stretches. Kids start giggling.

               Finally he leans into the microphone.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm sorry.

               He walks off stage.

                                     HOLMSTEAD
                              (to Mr. Norman)
                         Well, go after him.

               EXT. SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

               On his knees Kelly fumbles with his bike lock, getting madder 
               and madder. Just as he's about to get it undone --

               Lance appears.

                                     LANCE
                         What, they re-assign you to the 
                         bicycle brigade?

               Kelly frowns at the lock.

                                     KELLY
                         I'm busy.

                                     LANCE
                         Too bad, cause I'm not. Remember 
                         that little show I put on for the 
                         school?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't know what you're talking 
                         about.

                                     LANCE
                         Oh, come on. Pants down? Doll? Hard 
                         on?

               Kelly looks up at Lance.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh that. I heard about it.

                                     LANCE
                         And did you hear me and Bridget aren't 
                         going out anymore because of it?

                                     KELLY
                         I haven't been following the story.

                                     LANCE
                         Yeah well, let's get this over with.

                                     KELLY
                         It is over.

               Lance pushes Kelly away from his bike. Kelly falls back on 
               his hands.

               He squints up at Lance and moves back towards his bike.

               Lance KICKS him back with his foot and looks at him.

                                     KELLY
                         Just let me go home.

                                     LANCE
                         Did you call me a homo?

               Lance KICKS him again. Kelly breathes hard.

                                     KELLY
                         This isn't a good time for me. Let's 
                         re-schedule.

                                     LANCE
                         No time like the present.

               Lance picks Kelly up and SLAPS him hard on the face.

                                     KELLY
                         First you should probably get me to 
                         write home to my mother.

               Lance PUNCHES Kelly and he reels. Then Kelly lunges for him 
               and they fall to the ground. Kelly swings wildly but Lance 
               pins him down and gives him a few good ones.

               Then Mr. Norman comes out.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Stop it!

               Mr. Norman rushes over to them.

               Kelly scrambles up and rips at his bike lock, gets on his 
               bike and rides away.

               Mr. Norman tries to take a panting Lance by the arm but Lance 
               shakes him off.

                                     LANCE
                         Get off me.

               EXT. ERNSWILER HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly rides by his house and keeps going.

               EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Kelly stops and looks up at the hospital but can't bring 
               himself to go in. He pedals on.

               EXT. CLEVELAND WATERFRONT - DAY

               Kelly sits on the loading dock of an abandoned factory.

               He watches the rusty barges glitter on the water. The wind 
               ruffles his sweaty hair.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly's at the front door.

                                     MINNIE
                         Bart's not here. Sorry.

               She closes the door. Kelly wheels his bike down the driveway.

               He sees Bart sitting out by the pool with a couple of LANGELY 
               BOYS.

               Bart sees Kelly and ignores him, laughs at something one of 
               the guys says.

               INT. ERNSWILER HOUSE, BATHROOM - DAY

               Kelly sits on the toilet, putting a bandage on a red scrape 
               down his arm.

               Eve appears in the doorway.

                                     EVE
                         Oh Kelly. What happened?

               Kelly looks up at her. He's still got the cut eyebrow, which 
               has split back open, and some dried blood under his nose.

                                     KELLY
                         Nothing.

                                     EVE
                         Jesus. Let me see that.

               Eve comes over and tilts Kelly's head back to look at the 
               cut. This is the first time she's touched him.

               She gets some antiseptic and ointment from under the sink 
               along with Band-Aids and goes to work.

                                     KELLY
                         Ow.

               Kelly lets her dab at his face. He closes his eyes.

                                     EVE
                         I'm going over to see dad.

               Kelly opens his eyes and pulls away.

                                     KELLY
                         Oh.

               Eve puts a butterfly bandage across Kelly's eyebrow.

                                     EVE
                         And you need to come.

               Kelly pulls his head away.

                                     KELLY
                         I don't want to.

                                     EVE
                         At this point that's not an option.

                                     KELLY
                         Now's not a good time, ma.

               Eve looks at Kelly sadly.

                                     EVE
                         It's never a good time.

                                     KELLY
                         You can't make me.

               Eve shakes her head.

                                     EVE
                              (voice rising)
                         It's not about you anymore --

                                     KELLY
                         Don't you get it? It was never about 
                         me.

               Eve rises to her feet. He's just sent her over the edge.

                                     EVE
                              (yelling)
                         What is wrong with you? When are you 
                         going to stop blaming us, blaming 
                         him? I'm sick of you being angry. I 
                         want to be angry! They just took out 
                         half of your father's stomach -

                                     KELLY
                         Enough.

                                     EVE
                              (screaming and crying)
                         You will not tell me what's enough. 
                         You don't know about anything. All 
                         you do is fight fake battles, in the 
                         woods, on the playground. But this, 
                         right here, us - this is the real 
                         one, the only one worth anything.

               She stops and breaks down.

                                     EVE
                         The man I love is dying.

                                     KELLY
                         That's between you and him.

               Eve looks at her son. Her face looks older.

                                     EVE
                         If I made a mistake, if you felt 
                         left out, I'm sorry. But I can only 
                         deal with one thing at a time.

               Eve leaves. Kelly sits on the toilet, lost.

               INT. KELLY'S ROOM - MORNING

               The sun shines in through Kelly's window.

               He's laying in bed awake - has been for a while.

               He gets up and starts dressing slowly and deliberately. He 
               puts on his best shirt and tie, sensing trouble when the 
               tie's too short.

               He pulls the suit out of his closet.

               The jacket doesn't fit. The sleeves don't even go down to 
               his wrists.

               And he can hardly button the pants. He rips off the jacket.

               He pulls everything out of his closet. Nothing there.

               He sits on the edge of his bed with his head in his hands.

               He looks at his DRESS UNIFORM, hanging on the back of the 
               closet in its dry-cleaning bag, right where his mom left it.

               He shakes his head. No, he couldn't do that.

               Then he sighs.

               EXT. EPISCOPAL CHURCH - DAY

               It's decorated for a wedding. Flower garlands trail up the 
               banisters.

               GUESTS trickle in.

               Harrison, dressed in a suit with a boutonniere on his lapel, 
               talks to an USHER.

                                     HARRISON
                         Don't sit any of Mathilda's sisters 
                         next to me if you can help it.
                              (to guest)
                         Oh, hello. So nice to see you. Thank 
                         you for coming.

               Bart comes outside, also dressed as an usher.

                                     HARRISON
                              (to Bart)
                         Where's the priest?

                                     BART
                         He should be here any minute. Calm 
                         down.

               Bart walks down the steps and looks down the street.

               Kelly's walking towards him. IN HIS DRESS UNIFORM.

               Bart walks down the street to meet him.

                                     BART
                         What the fuck are you doing?

               Kelly looks down. He can't meet Bart's eyes.

                                     KELLY
                         I was invited.

                                     BART
                         I uninvited you.

                                     KELLY
                         It's not your wedding.

               Bart looks at Kelly and shakes his head.

                                     BART
                         Why are you wearing that?

               Kelly doesn't answer.

                                     BART
                              (softening)
                         I can't let you come in.

                                     KELLY
                         Why?

                                     BART
                         Because you know why. Just go home.

               Kelly finally looks up at Bart and nods.

               A Town Car pulls up.

               Tabby gets out in her wedding dress. Has there even been a 
               more glorious woman? Will there ever be again?

               Her MAID OF HONOR leads her around to the side of the church.

               Kelly watches every step.

                                     KELLY
                         She looks beautiful. Tell her - give 
                         her my congratulations.

               Kelly walks off.

               Bart watches him go.

               INT. BOWLAND HOUSE, KELLY'S ROOM - DAY

               Kelly sits on the edge of the bed, head in hands.

               He sees the torn rabbit painting. After a minute, he picks 
               it up and looks at it.

               INT. EVE'S STUDIO

               Xiou-Xiou sits painting. Kelly enters with the rabbit.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Oh! Son of Eve. You startled me.

                                     KELLY
                         Grandma Ling. Can you fix this?

               She examines it and takes out a wet sponge. She wipes it 
               across the back of the canvas.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Your mom made it for you. I can fix 
                         it.

               She works silently for a minute. Kelly watches her. She cuts 
               a small piece of canvas to repair the hole.

                                     KELLY
                         Did you come here to work on your 
                         own stuff? Don't waste your time on 
                         this.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         I never waste time.

               She turns the painting over and gets out some paints to touch 
               it up.

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         See. Everything can be mended.

                                     KELLY
                         You're trying to tell me something, 
                         aren't you?

                                     XIOU-XIOU
                         Oh no. I could not tell you anything.

               INT. HOSPITAL, ABE'S ROOM - DAY

               Eve sleeps in a chair next to Abe, in bed sleeping. He looks 
               pale but otherwise fine.

               Kelly stands in the doorway, still in his uniform.

               Abe comes to and sees him standing there.

                                     ABE
                         Hey. Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey dad. How you feeling?

                                     ABE
                         Not bad.

                                     KELLY
                         They gave me some stitches downstairs.
                              (points to eyebrow)
                         Three.

                                     ABE
                         Did you get punched?

                                     KELLY
                         A couple times, actually.

                                     ABE
                         I know the feeling. Come on in and 
                         watch some television. Don't worry, 
                         this one's bolted to the wall. As 
                         you can see, my reputation precedes 
                         me.

               Kelly comes into the room and sits in a chair.

                                     ABE
                         Any battles this weekend?

                                     KELLY
                         A few.

                                     ABE
                         Busy, busy.

               Abe and Kelly look up at the television in the corner.

                                     ABE
                         Answer me this: how come no one ever 
                         reenacts the Vietnam War?

                                     KELLY
                         It'd be pretty depressing, wouldn't 
                         it?

                                     ABE
                         I guess it would.

               Both continue to look up at the television.

                                     KELLY
                         Plus that, you'd have to have 
                         protesters and stuff.

                                     ABE
                         Folks dressed up like your mom and 
                         me. People reenacting fleeing to 
                         Canada, burning draft cards. I guess 
                         that would ruin the spirit of the 
                         thing, now wouldn't it?

                                     KELLY
                         I could make it work.

               Abe looks at Kelly.

                                     ABE
                         I bet you could.

               Kelly nods. Eve wakes up.

                                     EVE
                         Kelly, is that you?

                                     KELLY
                         You were expecting some one else?

               HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

               Kelly and Eve get snacks from the vending machine.

                                     KELLY
                         He looks good.

               Eve looks at Kelly, her face full of love and sadness.

                                     EVE
                         He looks just like you.

               Kelly nods slowly, taking this in. And it is finally too 
               much.

               He breaks down and cries. For the fear and the misplaced 
               rage, the fights and the stubbornness.

               But finally, relief.

               They walk back down the hall together. Eve reaches out and 
               puts her hand on Kelly's neck.

               EXT. BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

               Kelly rides his bike past the house and stops when he sees 
               the car packed up in front.

               Bart comes out with a box of stuff.

                                     BART
                         Hey.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey. You going away already?

                                     BART
                         Yeah. The have this intensive summer 
                         orientation thing.

                                     KELLY
                         Is that good?

               Bart puts the box in the car.

                                     BART
                         Well, it's optional, but dad thinks 
                         it would be "a good way to meet 
                         people."

                                     KELLY
                         He's probably right.

                                     BART
                         He usually is.

               They stand there.

                                     KELLY
                         Well, go Big Green.

               Kelly gives him a little ra-ra with one hand. Bart smiles.

               Kelly's been doing his research.

                                     BART
                         Thanks.

               Kelly lifts his foot up to the pedal of his bike.

                                     KELLY
                         Have fun. And get laid, will ya?

               Bart laughs a little and shakes his head. Kelly is gone.

               Harrison comes out.

                                     HARRISON
                         Is that everything?

                                     BART
                         Everything you'd let me bring.

               Harrison checks the ties on the roof.

                                     HARRISON
                         Give me a break.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Kelly stocks shelves.

               There's a NEW GIRL working the register.

               Kelly sees SARAH come in. He follows her to the bakery.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey.

                                     SARAH
                         Hey.

               Sarah picks some bagels.

                                     KELLY
                         How come you don't work here anymore? 
                         The Electro-shopper's getting rusty.

                                     SARAH
                         I've got a summer internship at an 
                         ad agency.

                                     KELLY
                         Fancy.

                                     SARAH
                         It's all right, I guess.

                                     KELLY
                         No, it's great.

               Kelly moves around to her other side, closer.

                                     KELLY
                         Hey -

               Sarah moves away. Once bitten twice shy and all that.

                                     SARAH
                         When are you going to get a real 
                         job?

                                     KELLY
                         I don't know. Probably when I figure 
                         out something better to do.

                                     SARAH
                         You can't be a stock boy your whole 
                         life.

               Sarah walks to the front of the store. Kelly walks with her.

                                     KELLY
                         Yeah I can. I mean, I probably won't, 
                         but I could.

               Sarah turns to him at the checkout aisle.

                                     SARAH
                         Well, it was good seeing you.

                                     SARAH
                         What?

                                     KELLY
                         Remember that presentation I told 
                         you never to ask me about again?

               INT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY

               Kelly stands in the front of the room, pointing to a battle 
               plan with large arrows drawn on it.

               Charlie, Mr. Norman, Principal Holmstead, Eve and Sarah sit 
               among other OLD SOLDIERS.

                                     KELLY
                         Lee arrayed his defenses over here. 
                         Only this time, Grant was ready for 
                         him.

               Kelly keeps talking. Many of the OLD SOLDIERS sleep.

                                     OLD SOLDIER 1
                              (to old soldier 2)
                         This is boring.

                                     OLD SOLDIER 2
                         Yeah. Let's see that slide of the 
                         wife again.

               DOMINO TABLE

               Sarah, Kelly, and Eve play dominos with Charlie and Mr. 
               Norman.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                              (to Charlie)
                         Remarkable, remarkable. And they 
                         never knew?

                                     CHARLIE
                         The real kicker was moving those 
                         cutouts of tanks around. The thought 
                         we had a whole regiment over there, 
                         but it was just a couple of us and 
                         those Hollywood props.

                                     EVE
                         That's amazing. Art playing a part 
                         in war.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're damned right. We practically 
                         won the thing right there.
                              (eyeing Sarah and Eve 
                              with approval)
                         Now this is more like it. Anyone 
                         care to place a wager on the table?

               Kelly tries to gesture to Sarah "no."

                                     SARAH
                         If you think it would be more fun.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         I can't imagine having more fun that 
                         I am now.

               Mr. Norman smiles at the group.

                                     CHARLIE
                         You're never been to a French 
                         whorehouse, I take it.

                                     EVE
                         I have.

                                     MR. NORMAN
                         Oh, my.

               EXT. OLD SOLDIERS' HOME - DAY

               Eve waits while Kelly and Sarah walk out to Sarah's car.

               Kelly helps Sarah into it and closes the door for her.

                                     KELLY
                         I still don't understand how you did 
                         that.

                                     SARAH
                         I spent my summers with my grandma 
                         in the Catskills. She didn't give me 
                         any spending money.
                              (shrugs)
                         So I played the bones for ice cream.

               She pulls away. He watches her go.

                                     KELLY
                         Hot damn.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARDROOM - DAY

A very grand room, with lots of wood and some very famous portraits round the
walls.

A group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen. They are the trustees of the
National Gallery. LORD WALTON, a very grand man, sits at the table head. To
his right sits his assistant, GARETH. All are deep in thought. LORD WALTON
fidgets with a pencil on the table. He raises his head as though about to
speak. Everyone looks up expectantly. And... LORD WALTON goes back to
fidgeting. So does everyone else.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    BOARD ROOM - DAY

The scene is as silent and static as we left it Last... then:

                                     GARETH
                       I suppose we could just sack him.
                                                                          CUT TO:

EXT.   MR BEAN'S STREET.     DAY

Mr BEAN comes out of his house, ready to face the world-

He walks up the street, tutting slightly at     a 'NO PARKING' sign he passes.
The street is totally car-free except for a     very visible lime green mini. A
policeman strolls by and glances down at a     pair of legs sticking out from
under it, next to a toolbox. He moves on,      satisfied that someone is mending
their car.

BEAN approaches the car     and whips out the fake legs he left there. He then
unlocks the big padlock     that secures the car door, pops the fake legs inside,
fiddles with something     else in the back seat, and drives away at a frightening
speed with a smug look     on his face.

The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins, as do the rest of the credits.

BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune jumps, as if
it has hit a scratch: the cinema audience should be worried there's a sound
fault.

BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen ~ he goes at them at quite a
lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps, the theme tune jumps
violently.

BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause of the
problem. Instead of having a car radio, BEAN has an old record player
strapped into the back seat, playing the theme tune.

On he drives, through empty streets - then JOLT - he's reached the glorious
familiarity of Central London, Big Ben and all - but heels now in dreadful
traffic.

Heels not happy. He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway. He
takes out a metal comb from his pocket and, using it like a bomber's sight-
line-checker, measures the front of his car and the width of the alley. He 'S

satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley. It is such a
perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the walls.

But at the end of      the alley, the traffic's just as bad.     BEAN    notices he's
outside Harrods.       There's a tail-coated Security Guard at    the    'front door.
BEAN watches him      stroll a bit down the street - and takes    his    chance. He
turns and drives      straight through the double doors, into    the    store.

                                                                                            2


INT.    HARRODS.   DAY.

BEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor, past perfume counters and
leather glove racks.

CUT TO a Security Guard. As       he passes one of the counters, BEAN's little car
just shoots behind him. The       Guard continues through the Children's section
there are giant elephants and      teddies, children's size cars, then two huge
plastic tractors - and then,      stock still, strangely in harmony actually, the
Lime Green Mini with BEAN in      it. The Guard walks straight past.

The moment he is gone, BEAN shoots off again - but, damn!, spies another Guard
and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed. The theme
song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps.

                                                                                 CUT TO:

6 people waiting at a gilded lift. They hear a strange sound, and turn to see
what it is. In fact, it's coming from inside the lift. When the lift doors
open, out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the street.

                                                                                        3


EXT.    KNIGHTSBRIDGE.     DAY.

Out in the street, BEAN is faced by an accident. There are flashing lights, a
crumpled car, suggestions of hurt passengers. BEAN looks concerned.

                                                                                 CUT TO:
EXT.    THE STRAND.     DAY.

An Ambulance roars through the traffic. It reaches its hospital, turns off,
and there, right smack behind it is the Mini. Cut in to see BEAN, smiling
broadly. He whizzes into Trafalgar Square, maybe even across it, sending
pigeons and tourists flying, and parks directly outside the statuesque
National Gallery. Of course, there's not another car there. Just the Gallery
and the mini.

                                                                                 CUT TO:

EXT.    NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN    gets out of the car, takes out his bag - thinks a little, opens it and
takes    out a "Doctor on Call' sign. To re-enforce it, he puts a bone in the
back    window and a skull of the front seat. Happy with the arrangement, he re-
locks    the padlock and sets off smiling up the big, stairs to work.

As he does so, pan up the building, and into the window of the room where that
Board meeting was taking place.

                                                                       CUT TO:

A grand gentleman, MR MORRISON, pipes up.

             Heels got the feeling back in his fingers - but his hands are
             still stapled together.

                                  LORD WALTON
             Mmmm, and how far are we with the computer, Hubert?

               useful?

A glimmer of hope.



INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    PORTRAIT SECTION - DAY

BEAN wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in them.
He passes a guard.

                                        GUARD
                           (not looking up from his book)
                     Morning, Bean.

The GUARD sighs with boredom. He gets this from BEAN every day. As Bean
moves on, he treads on the heel of a tourist's shoe. It comes off- BEAN moves
on blithely.

                                                                       CUT TO:

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY

BEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vinci's cartoon, 'The
Virgin and Child', hangs, preserved by a very dim artificial light. There are
silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the work,
listening to a female GALLERY GUIDE.

BEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing brings out a
coin. The coin drops and rolls into the special room. BEAN follows it into
the darkness.

                                   GALLERY GUIDE

                                    (hushed)
                   ... by Leonardo Da Vinci. As you can see, the special light
                   in here goes some way to protect the drawing from
                   photodisintegration caused by gamma ...

The camera stays outside the room with the picture in view. We hear the
squeak of a tiny door open, then a click. The room is suddenly flooded in
blazing white light. The onlookers gasp in horror.

                                                                               5

BEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin. As an afterthought he
pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light. He scuttles away.
The GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation.
                                                                      CUT TO:

             Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto trucks
             and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else. And not tell
             him.

                                        HUBERT
             Seconded.     We could all move to France.

                                       GEORGE
             All those in favour.

They all raise their hands wildly.

                                     LORD WALTON
                           Come on - settle down everyone.
                                                                            CUT TO:
INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    ELEVATOR - DAY

BEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other       people. He gives himself
a long squirt of breathfreshener. Then offers it to        the others, who politely
refuse him. So he stands still again. Pause. BEAN          then smells something
unpleasant. He leans and has a little sniff of the        person to his left. All
right there. Then he sniffs to his right, and reels        at what he smells. He
again takes out the breath freshener, and forces it       upon VINCENT, an elderly
gentleman, who is mortified.

At this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the camera
follows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters. He is another
trustee. This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door.

                                    VINCENT
                   I'm sorry I'm late.

                   Why can't we just give him the boot for crying out loud?!

                                                                               6

                                    VINCENT
                   Steady on, old man. I only ...

                                     GARETH
                   Not you, you idiot.

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY

BEAN, with cup of tea, walks along a corridor. He can't not interfere for
tidiness sake. One empty room he switches off the light. Another he shuts
the door.

He passes a computer room, with an open door where a big man is busily typing
in a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on.

He approaches the door to his office. A sign reads: 'STORAGE & CATALOGUE'.
There is a huge padlock on the door. BEAN takes out a big key and enters his
domain.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    STORAGE OFFICE - DAY.

BEAN enters. He's been here for years and made it his own. It's an odd
little world. There's a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk and
Airfix planes hang from the ceiling. Also a large cosy armchair and a T.V.

A pleasant Man in a suit, around 40, breezes in.

                                    SUIT MAN
             Ah Bean, I'm looking for a painting by Van Hocht.    Still Life.
             Circa 1670. Can do?

BEAN nods. This is what BEAN likes to do best. The camera follows as he
turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him...

His office is just a tiny    corner of a massive storage room, hundreds of feet
high and long, the walls    completely full of rack after rack of stored
paintings. At the end of     the room, we can see hundreds of sculptures: busts,
modern abstracts, men on    horses, classical maidens, Rodins, the lot. It's
like the giant storehouse    at the end of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.

                                                                                7

BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way. He knows exactly where heels
going. He climbs a ladder, like you find in a library - then pushes himself
off, and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden runners.

He has now reached the sculpture area, but    the painting heels looking for is
on the other side. He crosses the room by     using the sculptures as a kind of
artistic obstacle course. In front of him     is the Burghers of Calais, a Rodin
statue of 5 prisoners in chains. He simply     walks across their 5 heads, like
stones in a stream.

He then comes to an abstract modern piece, which he uses as    a slide   and at the
end of which, he crawls through the hole in the next modern    thing.    He then
begins to climb up various famous ancient statues, using the    mouths   as
footholes, breasts as support, codpieces as steps and empty    eyes as   finger
holes.

After a problem getting his. foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured dog, he
walks flat along a modern sculpture, then uses a sequence of classic
sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina, one step on to
the bottom of a horse, two steps onto the head of the person riding the horse,
three steps and now he's on the other side of the hall.

He then triumphantly pulls out a painting.     It's the one!,

              What would we do without you! The entire inventory of British Art
              stored in that one, curious brain of yours.

              Only if we're positive that the new catalogue database will render
              Mr. Bean's hitherto 'talents' obsolete.

                                      HUBERT
              There's no question.

                                                                                   8


                                    LORD WALTON
              Very well.   Mr Bean is.... art history.    We can all stop taking
              the pills.

A reserved smatter of laughter, from relief more than anything.      LORD W. talks
into an intercom on the table.

                                   LORD WALTON
              Miss Hutchinson, would you send Mr. Bean up to the boardroom,
              please.

                                  MISS HUTCHINSON
                                       (V/O )

              Yes sir. oh, and Lord Walton, the Grierson Gallery called again.

                                   LORD WALTON
              Thank you. (To the room) One final thing. Once again we have been
              invited by the Grierson Gallery of Southern California to second
              one of our staff for a short visit. The Grierson has a fairly
              modest collection - but it does include the most famous American
              painting of all, 'Whistler's Mother'. Any thoughts?

Cut to the trustees - they shake their heads and wrinkle, their noses, not
very interested. A 106 year old SIR RUPERT puts up his hand.

                                   LORD WALTON
              Yes. Sir Rupert. And may I say sir, how honoured we are that you
              still grace us with all your time, wisdom, and infinite knowledge.
              Your invaluable thoughts, sir?

                                    SIR RUPERT
              Could you speak up please. I didn't catch the question.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      STORAGE OFFICE - DAY

Back in his office area BEAN ceremoniously hands SUIT MAN the Van Hocht
painting. He's very proud of himself.

                                          SUIT MAN
               Thank you, Bean.      You're a genius.

                                                                                      9

BEAN laughs - delighted.         SUIT MAN exits and MISS HUTCHINSON enters, warily.

                                     MISS HUTCHINSON
               Mr. Bean.     Lord Walton would like to see you in the boardroom.

BEAN gives a little pleasured squeak.             How exciting for him.   He follows MISS
HUTCHINSON out into the corridor.

                                                                                  CUT TO:
INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      CORRIDOR.   DAY

BEAN    walks along    the same corridor as before. Turns off another light. Then
comes    to the room    where he saw the Programmer. The computer, showing a Van
Gogh    portrait, is    on and no-one's there. BEAN, who hates wasted electricity,
goes    in to switch    it off.

We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the Storage room -
with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located. BEAN is clearly
going to be replaced by this programme. Or not ... BEAN searches for the
plug, but it's under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of the
back the computer. The entire system clicks off. At which moment the
Programmer comes back in.

                                       PROGRAMMER
                       What's happening here?

                                            BEAN
                       Ahm...

With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with puzzlement
at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random guess. And
a disastrous one. There is a ugly electrical fizzle. The screens come on
white, then pop out completely.

                                            BEAN
                       Ah.... Ahm....

BEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the cable
into another circuit. The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen. BEAN and
PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief. BEAN smiles and leaves quickly.
But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh slides
down the screen like a water-colour in the rain. The PROG difficult to
breathe.

                                                                                          10

                                                                                  CUT TO:
 INT.     NATIONAL GALLERY.      BOARDROOM - DAY

                                    LORD WALTON
               You have your voting slips, gentlemen.          Please remember the

             Americans are looking for something quite high powered.     A
             doctorate preferably...

There is a knock at the door. BEAN enters. LORD WALTON smiles. The rest of
the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug. BEAN is very
nervous indeed.

                                  LORD WALTON
                                   (gravely)
             Ah, Mr. Bean. Please take a seat for a moment.      I have some news
             which will not, I'm afraid...

The phone rings. LORD WALTON answers. BEAN sits next to VINCENT and sniffs
at him. VINCENT's breath hasn't improved.

                                      LORD WALTON
                                     (into phone)
             Yes?     Put him on... Timothy. The computer ... Yes... When? How?
             All    of it? Absolutely all of it? Did you back it up? How long
             will    it ... ? Another six months. Fair enough. Come up here
             will    you, dear boy.

He slowly hangs up. Everyone has got the gist of what has just occurred with
the new computer- The energy drains from them all as they contemplate another
six months with BEAN still on the staff. LORD WALTON coughs politely.

                                  LORD WALTON
             As I was saying, gentlemen. The Grierson Gallery. South
             California. Great opportunity. Thousands-of miles-away though it
             is. Doctorate or ( IMPISHLY ) no doctorate, perhaps

All get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their voting
slips. The slips get handed down the line to LORD WALTON. We see that every
single slip has 'BEAN' on it.

                                     LORD WALTON
             Mr. Bean.     Wonderful news. You are going to America.

                                       MR. BEAN
                                    (overwhelmed)
             Ooooh, how lovely.

There is a knock at the door. The fat, bespectacled,
PROGRAMMER puts his head round it.

                                    LORD WALTON
                                     (beaming)
             Ah, Timothy.    You're sacked.

                                                                             CUT TO:


INT.   NATIONAL GALLERY.    CORRIDOR - DAY

BEAN rounds a corner and walks     towards us, imitating a bowlegged cowboy. The
Theme from Bonanza plays. He      whips out his pair of imaginary six shooters,
spins them on his fingers and     returns them to-their imaginary holsters, making
gun sound effects. He's very      happy.-He passes the Security Guard - he draws
his gun on him - zero reaction     the Guard just raises his eyebrows and yawns.

BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly, his good mood is

broken, when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition, called The
Ultra-Human Form. This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads in to
the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes, and the 3 girls are
having a good giggle.

BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the painting
they're inspecting.

Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also has
breasts. BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other hand.

Now the third girl    heads on, so BEAN can drop the hand on the first painting -
but now has to try    to cover the breasts on the third painting, which is a real
long stretch away.     He can't quite make it, so he takes off his shoes, which
gives him the extra    3 inches. Again, safe. Just.

Now, all three girls leave the paintings - but, to BEAN's chagrin, head over
to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room. It's like the 3
Graces, 3 naked women back to back. BEAN thinks fast. He quickly whips off
his

                                                                              12

Belt and rushes over to the statue, where he succeeds in looping it round to
cover all six nipples.

Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to the other
side of the gallery. To BEAN's horror. Because at that moment we reveal what
is on the other side of the room. A epic painting in the style of the others
- with literally 40 graphically naked people.

BEAN sprints across the room, stands on a chair, and desperately tries to
cover a particularly lurid example of a gentleman's manhood.

At which    moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls appear and
scream in    chorus. BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has caused offence
and is in    outraged agreement with them. He turns. Cut wide to reveal that
they are    screaming because he's beltless
trousers    have fallen down.
                                                                          CUT TO:

EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.     AMERICA - DAY.

8.30 am California time. A modern building with plenty of glass. Large,
modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of
two huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air.

THOMAS GRIERSON, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks
with DAVE LEARY and BERNIE, both in casual jackets and ties. GRIERSON is a
vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man - maybe short - always just trying to
show he's Boss. The three are strolling towards the main entrance. Huge
sign: 'THE GRIERSON GALLERY' with a silhouette of Whistler's Mother taken from
the painting, as an incorporated logo.

                                      GRIERSON
               Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in
               the English art world. Has a couple of doctorates no less.

                                       BERNIE
               Great news.

BERNIE is smooth and smiley. DAVID LEARY, Vice President, is a very pleasant,
but slightly worried man, knocking on 40. Too nice for his own good. The
three pass a lone MIME ARTIST wearing a cheap vac-form PRESIDENT CLINTON face
mask. David can't help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left
behind. He scampers to catch up.

                                                                                   9
First, catching under the handle - then the couch, then

Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze.        No-one's going to get in
through that door.

BACK IN THE    HALL BEAN pushes the string    back inside the    letter box and slaps
his hand in    satisfaction. He locks the     door's enormous    padlock, looks about
carefully to    make sure no one's around,    and then hides    the key under a garden
gnome on the    floor, standing amongst a    row of pathetic    pot plants.

                                                            MIX THROUGH TO:
INT.    AIRPORT.   RECEPTION DESK.   NIGHT

The lady checking in BEAN looks puzzled as she holds his passport. So he
pulls the shockingly stupid face. 0h yes, she sees, that's the guy in the
picture. She hands him his ticket.

                                   CHECK-IN LADY
                Here we go, sir. You've been moved to l st. class. Apparently
                your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that you're
                finally on your way.

 BEAN is very touched.

                                                                               CUT TO:

 INT.    AIRPORT LOUNGE - NIGHT

 BEAN enters the first class lounge. It's fairly empty, but BEAN still
 squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea, and a very grand
 looking American military man in a business suit.

 The Grand Man lights up a cigar. This doesn't please Mr "No Smoking BEAN.
 First, he waves the smoke away, in small, then big, then huge wafting
 motions. Then he tries, miming, to cut it up into segments and move them
 aside. The man pays no attention at all.

 BEAN puts a plastic mug over his face, like a gas mask and breathes heavily.
 The man looks at him - but doesn't give a damn

 BEAN now takes a paper bag - catches some of the smoke, and take it over and
 empties it into the dust bin.

 The Grand Man goes on smoking stubbornly.        He then sees a magazine rack and
 leaves his cigar as he goes to get one.

                                                                                       13

                                        DAVID

               Sounds like a real coup, sir... getting this Doctor of ...


                                      GRIERSON

            Various things. Thank you. However, as you know, this is not an
            inexpensive venture, and, financially speaking, we're in very
            serious crap right now.

 He can't quite hide his tackiness.) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON - then
 sees an old woman coming towards him. He waits for her to go through, and
 due to his sweetness, is again left behind. He rushes to catch up.

They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop. DAVID exchanges
smiles with the cashier, ANNIE. Very bubbly, not very bright. The shop is
full of Whistler's Mother memorabilia - posters, cards, porcelain statuettes.

                                    GRIERSON
            So ... I'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your
            home instead of some expensive hotel.

                                     BERNIE
            Love to, sir, but no can do. No spare room.   Period.

                                        GRIERSON
            David?

                                      DAVID
            Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really
            like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't
            really er ...

                                    GRIERSON
            I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate
            attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial
            LOSS ...

                                      DAVID
              on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my
              family needs ... Yes. Great news. Fabulous. Triumphant. Course
              it might need a little smoothing over. When's he due?

GRIERSON hands DAVID a piece of paper.

                                      GRIERSON
              Tomorrow.   You have a problem with that?

PAUSE

                                       DAVID
              No. Perfect.   Looking forward to it.
                                                                        CUT TO:


INT.    LONDON . PHOTO BOOTH.    DAY.

The camera faces Mr BEAN sitting in a Photo booth. His face is totally
impassive for 1, 2, then 3 flashes. And then, just before the 4th flash, he
pulls the biggest, maddest face you've ever seen. Flash! He gives a little

Satisfied giggle.

                                                                        CUT TO:


 EXT.    THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY

 7 p.m. California time. A pleasant suburban house. DAVID's car pulls into
 the drive. JENNIFER, his slightly Gothic 16 year old daughter, is kissing
 BRAD, her scruffy boyfriend. He sits astride a motor scooter. He has a
 bum-fluff moustache.

 DAVID gets out of his car and approaches them.


                                   DAVID
            Hi, Jennifer. How was school? (she doesn't break the kiss with
            Brad) oh really? That's good, great. Fantastic. We'll talk some
            more.

 The two continue kissing as DAVID moves on. He's just about to head for the
 house when a swish convertible draws up at the curb. DAVID's wife, ALISON,
 has been given a lift home by her young attractive boss, CHARLES. They are
 laughing in the car as DAVID walks up.

                                                                               15

He is slightly disturbed to see ALISON kiss CHARLES on the cheek before
getting out with her port folio. CHARLES smiles pleasantly on seeing DAVID.

                                      CHARLES
            Hello, David.

                                    DAVID
            Hi, Charles. (To Alison) Wow - late!

                                    ALISON
                                  (brightly)
            I had to do some last minute stuff.

                                  CHARLES
            My fault. We've got a heavy load on at present.     How about you,
            gallery going well?

                                    DAVID
            Ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level I
            think it ....

                                    ALISON
            Don't ask him about work, Charlie. Life's too short.

Alison is the same age as DAVID, but seems to have lasted the course better -
she's confident, in good shape. The atmosphere is awkward. JENNIFER screams
out. Her 8 year old brother, KEVIN has sprung from the shrubbery and lassoed
her and BRAD. ALISON goes over to sort them out.

                                     ALISON
            Kevin!   You stop that right now!

                                      CHARLES
            Great kids.     Good looking too.

                                      DAVID
            You think so?    Well I 'spose they're pretty, you know... okay,
            looks-wise.

                                      CHARLES

            Take after their mother, huh?

                                       DAVID
            Ah ... absolutely.

DAVID is not very happy here.

                                                                               16

                                                                          CUT TO:
 INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - DAY

It is open plan and leads through into the lounge. DAVID and ALISON enter.
ALISON puts her port folio on the table and leads DAVID onto a sofa. She puts
her arms round him.


                                    ALISON
            Let's take a break, David. This weekend, why don't we just get
            into the car and drive to the coast. Find a motel. Like before
            the kids were born. Go to a fairground. Win me another Bambi.

She reaches across and picks up a little ceramic Bambi on a table next to the
couch.

                                    ALISON
            Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin

                                    DAVID
            Sounds great. Excellent. Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's
            coming to work at the Gallery, from England...

                                       ALISON
                                  (SUSPICIOUSLY)
                                      Yeeees?

                                    DAVID
            And they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a
            while.

                                      ALISON
            There aren't hotels?

                                    DAVID
            Yes, there are hotels. They just thought maybe it'd be nice for
            him to stay with a real American family. Popcorn, waffles, all
            that stuff.

                                       ALISON
                                    (POINTEDLY)
            And what did you say?

                                    DAVID
            I said I'd check with you.

She looks at him piercingly.     This clearly happens a lot.   She knows when he's
telling the truth. Pause.

                                       DAVID
            Then I said 'yes'.

She puts Bambi carefully back on the table, gets up and moves to the kitchen.
DAVID follows.

                                      ALISON
              Do we know anything about him?

                                     DAVID
              Ahm - he's male. He's English. He's a doctor of er ...      at least
              2 things. I think they would have mentioned if he was a     blind
              dwarf. Or one of those guys who kills lots of people all     the
              time. I think we're looking at someone moderately normal     here.

                                      ALISON
              David - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?

                                       DAVID
              Yes.   Yes. (pause) Sometime.

 She shakes her head.

                                      ALISON
              It's the last thing we need.

                                      DAVID
              That's exactly what I said ... before I said - Great, it's a
              sensational idea."

He knows he's made a mess here.       Enter KEVIN, their smart young son, strolling
through.

                                      KEVIN
              Hiya Dad ~ I'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....
              (checks watch) oh, 20 minutes.

                                        DAVID
                                    Great, good.

And KEVIN exits.

                                                                                  18

                                      DAVID
               Didn't kids do their own homework, like way back?     Years ago?
               No. Course not. Just imagining it.

 ALISON isn't really listening.       Much tension.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - NIGHT

9.30 p.m. U.K. time. A black London taxi is parked outside a terraced house
with its motor idling. Its driver looks fed up waiting. BEAN appears at a
downstairs window, motioning to his watch that he will not be long.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   MR.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - DAY

MR. BEAN is ready to leave his room.       Battered old

suitcase in hand, he checks the room from the doorway.

Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards,

drawers, fridge -sports an oversized padlock.    Even

Bean's old G.P.O. phone has one on its dial.

BEAN looks across to his TEDDY, who is lounging on a miniature chair, inside
an up-sided cardboard box. The box is sits on an armchair. A hand-written
sign, taped to its roof reads: 'TEDDY HOTEL' followed by three stars.
                                                                            19

A smaller sign informs us that the hotel is: 'FULL'. BEAN is just about to
leave but stops to consider. Taking a felt tipped pen, he adds two more stars
on the hotel hoarding, as a treat.

He then, slightly, incomprehensibly, begins to tie string it around various
objects in the flat. The fridge - the corner of a chair, a couch leg.

                                                                        CUT TO:

INT.   MR.   BEAN'S RESIDENCE'S HALLWAY ~ DAY

BEAN leaves his flat. lee notice a large official sign stuck on the door
saying 'NO SMOKING". He now turns his attention to the pieces of string
hanging out the letter box in his door. Grabbing the bunch of them, he pulls.

CUT TO back inside the flat. we now understand the string - as all the
furniture starts to move across the flat. It works incredibly neatly the
chair reaches the door

                                                                               20

BEAN acts fast.    He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the old woman's
cup of tea.

He sits there, guiltlessly, as the Grand Man returns. Simultaneously, the man
tries to suck the wet cigar, and the Old woman drinks the disgusting tea. A
horrid experience for both.

                                                                        CUT TO:


INT.   AEROPLANE - DAY.

Boarding time. BEAN enters the plane and turns    right, into the body of the
plane. After walking right down the plane, he    is directed by a hostess back
up to first. As he walks back, we notice the'    ridiculous contrast, from
totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of   children and muzak, to the
elegance, and space of First class.

BEAN couldn't be more thrilled.    There follows a sequence of short moments
from this nightmare flight.

1/ The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her ,luggage.    A hostess
slides it into the compartment above her head.

                                      OLD LADY
               Be careful.   It's for my Grand-daughter.

The next instant BEAN comes up with his case. He opens the     same locker, and
tries to fit his case in. Doesn't quite go - so he pushes     it violently. We
hear crunching cracking sounds. Finally, it's almost there     - BEAN slams the
locker door. One final definitive, though muffled, smash.      The OLD LADY looks
at BEAN suspiciously.

2/ BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour? The Grand Man,
whose name is REYNOLDS. BEAN smiles merrily. The affection is not mutual.

Champagne comes    round instantly. BEAN takes it, along with a small bowl of
nuts, and clinks    glasses with his unsmiling partner. BEAN tries to impress
him by throwing    nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth (a well
practised art).     No response.

BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower. Then can't turn it down
again. It's very stuck. He manages however to push it away from his face -
straight into REYNOLDS' . REYNOLDS looks annoyed, BEAN guiltless.

                                                                                 21

Then 'BEAN has an idea. He takes a tissue out of his pocket, puts in his
mouth, chews it into a spitball

And rams it into the blower. Both of them are relieved. REYNOLDS picks up
his champagne to have his first proper sip. And whapp! The spitball, under
high pressure, shoots

into it, sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS.     Not a good start.


3/--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine. There's an annoying sound. He
looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat across the
aisle. He's fallen asleep with his headphones on. BEAN looks annoyed. Then
suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors he
carries. He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on purpose
simply cuts the wire of the boy's headset. That's better.

4/ Night. Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool of
light. It's Mr BEAN still up, reading.

But even he is   wilting. His eyes close, and his body starts to waver towards
sleep. Next to    him, REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and
unfortunately,   as BEAN slowly tips over, his mouth comes into direct contact
with REYNOLDS'   flies.

From across the compartment, a hostess sees what's happening. She's shocked,
comes over and taps BEAN on the ,,shoulder. He shoots up, and nearly
strangles her in shock. She calms him down, shows him how to put his chair
back - and leaves him to sleep. CUT ON....

5/ REYNOLDS still asleep. With BEAN asleep completely on top of him.
Completely. His hand is spread on REYNOLDS' face. REYNOLDS' eyes open.         He
sees what's happened. His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess.

6/ Morning has broken. REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is wide
awake. The Hostess approaches, and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says her son
isn't very well.

BEAN decides to cheer him up. He mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel
more ill. Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of
paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them.

He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his trick of
throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. The boy is too ill
to be impressed.

BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy
and then a tough American Cop. Nothing. Then he has an extremely fun idea.
He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them.

                                                                                22

He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake REYNOLDS, when
he sees it's got a hole in it. No fun.

Meanwhile, the Boy has taken out his sick-bag. BEAN is delighted - yes,
that's perfect. He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless
bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. BEAN turns, grabs the
bag from him - blows into it, puts it right into REYNOLDS' face at arms
length, and smacks his hands together. CUT at just the right moment.

                                                                        CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT

The traditional exit area. A random bunch of people are waiting - relatives,
limousine drivers - and, rather strangely, three 30 year old women dressed in
curly red wigs from the musical, 'Annie'.

The LEARYS are at the barrier. KEVIN has a cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN'
written on it. People are streaming out of the Arrivals gate. ALISON is not
happy. Actually no one is. JENNIFER looks particularly fed up.

                                        DAVID

             For all you know, he may be a very attractive young man.

                                    JENNIFER
             Oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.   All Englishmen are
             ugly.

                                        DAVID
What makes you say that?

                                   JENNIFER
           All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan
           Day-Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish. Even Anthony
           Hopkins is welsh. Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two
           million bucks a year to stay indoors.

                                     DAVID
             Richard Burton was very good-looking.

                                      JENNIFER
             Welsh.

                                        DAVID
             Sean Connery.

                                       ALISON
             Scottish.

                                       DAVID
             Tom Jones?

                                     JENNIFER
             Welsh again.

                                     DAVID
             Okay, so the guy's gonna look like Meatloaf's backside.    No-one's
             asking you to go to bed with him.

JENNIFER glares at him.     A tired ALISON has had enough of this waiting
already.

                                       ALISON
             Bed sounds good though.    Bed sounds great.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.    CONVEYER - NIGHT

BEAN, is off the plane. REYNOLDS strides ahead of him, a huge wet patch in a
semi-circle around his neck. BEAN comes to a moving walkways. He steps on to
it sheepishly, thinking it's very daring and brave, gripping the handrail as
though he was travelling at 100 mph.

But soon he gains greater confidence. He stands up straight, both hands off
the rail. There are a couple of COPS leaning against a wall, chatting. BEAN
notices their guns. Slipping into role-play mode, he reaches into his breast
pocket, ready to bring out his imaginary shooter ... The last security guard
he tried this with just yawned ~ so BEAN thinks it's safe. But this time, the
COPS turn and stare at him tensely..

Flustered by their interest in him, BEAN needs to get away. He turns,        but
finds that he is walking in the opposite direction, on the spot. The        COPS
read this as suspicious behaviour and move towards him suspiciously.        BEAN
turns to gets himself going in the right direction. The COPS follow.         BEAN
runs. The COPS give chase.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   'AMERICAN AIRPORT.    ARRIVALS - NIGHT

A little BALD MAN arrives at the barrier. The three red wigged clones from
the musical, `Annie' swamp him with shrieks and kisses. The LEARYS are
getting impatient.

             Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.

                                     DAVID
             Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.

                                       KEVIN
             I vote for Bart.

             Shut up, Kevin.

                                     KEVIN
          NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something
          about his upper lip that is so weird. What do you think it is, Dad?
          Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11
          mosquitoes, resting.

                                   JENNIFER
          You know the thing I hate most about children?

                                      KEVIN
          Nope.

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.   CORRIDOR - NIGHT

BEAN is running down the busy corridor with the two COPS in pursuit.      They
draw their guns. Two more COPS appear,

coming from the opposite direction.    BEAN is trapped.    He drops his case.

                                       COP 1
                           Police!   Stop or we shoot!

                                                                                 25

Passers-by scream and throw themselves to the floor. BEAN freezes on the
spot, terrified. All four COPS have their guns trained on him in the shooting
position.

                                     COP 1
             Carefully take out your weapon, holding the butt with two fingers
             only. Slowly place it on the floor and take three paces back!

Dead slowly, BEAN puts his hand into his inside jacket pocket and brings it
back out made in the shape of a gun. He slowly transfers that imaginary item
to the finger and thumb of his left hand. He bends down and places it on the
floor then takes three paces back. He gives out a big breath after the effort
of it all. The COPS just stare at him, gob-smacked.

Little OLD LADY from plane steers up from nowhere. She rattles her box of
broken china and kicks BEAN in the shins. Things are not going his way.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.   POLICE INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT

Bright and clinical. Close on BEAN sitting behind a       table; a very small man
in very big trouble. Behind him, two uniformed COPS       stand guard. A large,
black plain clothes detective sits opposite, smoking      a cigarette. This is
BRUTUS. He studies BEAN's passport photo. It's the        baboon face. He holds it
up to bean's face to make a comparison. BEAN pulls       the face to match the
photo.

                                     BRUTUS
             Mr. Bean. Are you presently on any kind of medication at all?

BEAN thinks deeply for a moment then shakes his head.

                                     BRUTUS
             You could certainly use some.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.   ARRIVALS - NIGHT

ALISON, JENNIFER and KEVIN are slumped in seats near the barrier.      DAVID walks
up.

                                     ALISON
             What did they say?

                                                                               26

                                     DAVID
             Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...

                                     ALISON
             Did you really ask?

                                     DAVID
             I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...

                                     ALISON
             What's wrong with you, David? All you have to do is say, Excuse
             me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and
             I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
             I'll go.

                                      DAVID

             No, no.   I'11 try again ...

                                     ALISON
              I said, I'11 go.

 She goes. KEVIN shakes his head disappointedly al,-- his father. DAVID
 slumps down on the seat. He overhears JENNIFER flirting with an incredibly
 undesirable bloke in a leather jacket - white, with Rasta hair extensions,
 and about sixty rings in his nose. (This is STINGO).

                                    JENNIFER
             So. where do your parents live?

                                     STINGO
             My parents are dead.

 DAVID is pretty confident that he knows who killed them.

                                    JENNIFER
             Yeah, so are mine.

                                                                          CUT TO:

EXT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.     TAXI RANK. NIGHT

COP 1 puts BEAN in the back of a taxi with his case.      He

takes some dollar notes from his own wallet and hands them to the driver.

                                                                                   27


                                     COP 1
             Just get him the hell out of here, will ya?

He slams the door and the taxi drives away.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT-.     ARRIVALS - NIGHT

The LEARYS are all asleep in eccentric positions on the seats. JENNIFER's
head is resting on STINGO's leg. Kevin's cardboard sign with 'MR. BEAN,
written on it falls from his lap to the floor.

                                                                           CUT TO:


EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

The taxi draws up outside the house.      BEAN gets out with his case.   The CAB
DRIVER is strangely friendly.

                                   CAB DRIVER
             Thanks man, I can't tell you how much I appreciate talking to ya.
             In this job you get so many jerks spilling their guts all over ya,
             with their stupid problems ... But you, you're a great listener,
             ya know that?

BEAN smiles politely. Taxi drives away. BEAN walks up to' the front porch,
checks the house number on his piece of paper and presses the doorbell. No
answer. Presses again. Still no answer ... Now where have they hidden the
key. He inspects things carefully.

The camera sees what he sees ... the     doormat, the flowerpot, the window-ledge
... and then he spots a little stone     frog. BEAN smiles. Key hiding is
something he knows about - and people     are pathetically obvious about it. BEAN
picks up the FROG to reveal the front     door key. It glints in the porch-light.

                                                                           CUT TO:


INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.     HALLWAY - NIGHT

BEAN lets himself in. The pre-alarm buzzer goes off quietly. He has 15
seconds before the alarm goes off proper. He strolls confidently to where the
alarm control unit obviously is ... under the stairs.

                                                                                   28

Close-up of flashing L.E.D. Again, BEAN looks carefully and finds the magnetic
box, housing a little key, attached to the underside of the console. Just as
the alarm goes off, for the splittest of a secondette, he turns the key in its
slot ... and is safe.

BEAN finds the switch and turns on the hall light. He switches it off again
... then on. Then rapidly clicks it on and off repeatedly.Fun.

                                                                                CUT TO:

INT.     THE LEARY HOUSE.    LOUNGE - NIGHT

BEAN stands in front of the television, looking a little annoyed about the
fact that the remote control in his hand is having no effect at all. He stabs
at it randomly.

                                                                                CUT TO:

INT.     DAVID'S CAR - NIGHT

KEVIN and JENNIFER are asleep in the back. DAVID drives in silence, Alison
next to him. Uneasy atmosphere. DAVID stabs at buttons on the car radio.

                                       ALISON
               It isn't working any more, David.

                                       DAVID
               I know - I'11 take it in to George tomorrow'- he'll fix it.
               Stupid thing.

HE SWITCHES IT OFF.

                                                                                     29

                                          ALISON
                No, US.     It's not working any longer -you and me.

 Pause. DAVID's now heard it completely. He takes his eyes off the road and
 stares at ALISON a moment too long. A car's horn snatches back his
 attention.

                                          DAVID
               Jesus.

                                       ALISON
                I need some time, David. A little time.        It's not just you.
                It's partly me.

                                          DAVID

                But in general ... it's ... mostly me, right?

Pause.     Single shot of Alison and David.       She doesn't answer.   He is

destitute.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   HALLWAY - NIGHT

BEAN wanders down the stairs in his pyjamas. He sees a walkman - and puts it
on happily. He moves to the rhythm. He locks the door, turns on the alarm
and turns off the
hall light.

                                                                         CUT TO:
EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - NIGHT

DAVID's car turns into the drive just as the hall light goes off. (For the
next few minutes, knife-edged timing 0 is all). The LEARYS sleepily get out
of the car and approach the house. DAVID brings out his door key.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   UPSTAIRS LANDING - NIGHT

The exact moment the key turns in the lock, BEAN, still wearing headphones,
disappears into a bedroom with a little ceramic sign on it saying: 'GUEST
ROOM'.

The exhausted family enter an apparently untouched house. KEVIN turns on the
stairs light, climbs to his room off the landing and closes the door on which
a sign reads: 'KEVIN'.

                                                                              30

At that instant BEAN walks out, looking for the bathroom with his wash bag.
He looks up at the light. It should not be on. He frowns, turns it off and
exits to bathroom. At which precise moment JENNIFER, zombie-like, is halfway
up the stairs

                                     JENNIFER
             Thanks a lot, Kevin!

JENNIFER goes into her room.     The sign reads: `JENNIFER'.

ALISON turns on the light and climbs the stairs. David heads into the
kitchen. They exchange a sad look. She goes into their bedroom: the sign
reads: 'GRUPS'. At which instant, BEAN, still wearing headphones, leaves the
bathroom, and heads downstairs ....

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   KITCHEN - NIGHT

The light is on. DAVID takes a deep breath. Bad night. He picks up an empty
coffee jar, sighs and goes into the pantry a full one. BEAN enters. He opens
the refrigerator and he studies the food on offer. Nothing he fancies ...
then BINGO!

He sees a little plate of 3 strawberries. He eats     one, then two, then pops
the third into his mouth. It tastes a bit off, so     he takes it out of his
mouth, puts it back on the plate, closes the fridge    door, and exits ... just
as DAVID comes out of the pantry. Close on BEAN's     hand as it comes round the
door frame and turns off the light. DAVID, on the     move, stubs his toe on a

chair. He groans in pain, limps to the fridge.        He spots the lone, already
sucked strawberry and pops it into his mouth.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALISON is watching T.V. in bed with the remote control.       DAVID enters with
orange juice and puts it down by his side of the bed.

                                      DAVID

             The lights blown in the kitchen. I'll fix it tomorrow.

They're not a happy couple.    She concentrates on the TV even turns it up a
little.

                                                                           CUT TO:

BEAN turns on the basin's cold faucet.       It gushes noisily.

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   D & A'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Close on Letterman on the TV. The noise from it drowns out any noise from the
bathroom.(The bathroom has two doors - one into DAVID and ALISON's bedroom,
the other onto the landing)..

                                                                           CUT TO:
INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.   BATHROOM - NIGHT

BEAN can't hear the T.V. because of his headphones. He takes out his
toothbrush but notices an electric one on a shelf with spare brush heads.
He's intrigue. He swaps the heads and enjoys cleaning his teeth with this
clever modern implement.

-He puts the   electric brush down and checks his teeth    in the mirror. He has
forgotten to   turn off the brush and so it vibrates off    the sink and lands in
the toilet.    Bean fishes it out and places it back on    the shelf where he found
it. He turns    off faucet, then exits, turning out the    light.

DAVID enters and turns the light on again. He takes down the toothbrush and
cleans his teeth. He calls through the bedroom door.

                                     DAVID
             That poor guy, Bean ... He's probably still sitting at London
             Airport!

He finishes his teeth then runs the hot faucet.       He exits to bedroom as BEAN
enters from hall with dirty socks.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.      BATHROOM ~ NIGHT

BEAN is just finishing washing his socks in David's water. He rings the dirty
water from them, and exits. DAVID enters in his under shorts. He checks his
tired eyes in the mirror then washes his face in the basin water without
looking.

                                                                               CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.      LANDING ~ NIGHT

BEAN notices a framed photograph on the wall. It is of the LEARY family.
They are grouped outside their house. It is a very happy picture. BEAN
smiles at it. He takes it off the wall and takes it into a bedroom. As the
door quietly closes we see the sign: 'JENNIFER'.

                                                                               CUT TO:

               I need to make a confession. I know you're awake.       Please, it's
               important.

(Long pause)

                                        ALISON
                                  (without stirring)
               Go ahead.

                                       DAVID
               I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.

ALISON smiles in spite of herself. She turns over and puts her arm around
DAVID. She gets up close to his face.

                                       ALISON
               There were three strawberries.

                                         DAVID
               One.

               0h Ali we can work this thing out, you know.

ALISON smiles, sleepily, and goes to kiss him. She stops and sniffs.
Thoroughly put off, she rolls over and closes her eyes.

                                         DAVID
               Ali?    What's wrong?

Birds sing. It's a lovely, peaceful, early morning. Then ... a terrifying

                                     ALISON
             Shut up, Kevin. (to Jennifer) Honey, you-re not making sense ...

                                       DAVID
             It's okay.    There's no one out here. Just open the door.   Trust
             me.

Pause ... then a click of the bathroom lock ... Jennifer comes out. Then
there's another click. BEAN breezes out of Jennifer's bedroom, past the
family, in his pyjamas, carrying a wash bag and a towel over his arm. He
waves to them friendly, slips into the bathroom and closes the door. The
family stare in amazement.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    KITCHEN - DAY

The family, now dressed for work and school, are having breakfast at the
kitchen table. After an uncomfortable silence:

                                        KEVIN

            He makes Prince Charles look kind of handsome.

                                    ALISON
            He can't stay here, David.

                                   DAVID
            Okay. It's not a problem... Let's just sit ... I'11 talk to the
            gallery ...

                                    ALISON
            David, I'm serious!

                                     DAVID
            I know you are.   Very serious ... most of the time these days.

                                    ALISON
            Now what does that mean? My daughter wakes up with a strange man
            in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing? (looks at his
            tie) That tie's God-awful. Why do you wear it?

DAVID is thrown.   He looks down at his tie.   JENNIFER looks grumpy.   KEVIN is
eating happily.

                                                                               35

BEAN enters, dressed, carrying a plastic carrier bag.    He acknowledges the
family with a grunt and a smile.

                                     DAVID
            Ah, Mr Bean ...

                                     BEAN
            Excuse me.

 He moves to the phone, checks his watch and dials quickly.
                                                                         CUT TO:



 INT.   BEAN'S BED-SIT - ENGLAND - NIGHT

 The ancient G.P.O. phone starts to ring on a small table. (The following
 takes place in a matter of seconds).

 On the table are two, large, shiny, hard backed books, wedged up    at one end
 and sloping away at right angles to one another. Each book has a     pair of
 rulers set, parallel to one another, in Play-Doh. They each form     a canal.
 Between one pair of rulers sits a small box of salt. Between the    other pair
 is a miniature bust of BEETHOVEN. As the phone continues to ring     and
 vibrate the table, these items judder along the canal, an inch at    a time.

 The box of salt teaches the bottom of the book and topples over the edge of
 the table. ( The BEETHOVEN bust' teeters on the edge of its book). The salt
 lands in a plastic funnel, taped to the top of a bamboo stick. The bottom
 of the stick sits on the BBC 2 button of a T.V. remote control. Close-up of
 its infrared L.E.D. as it flashes once. The phone stops ringing.

 CUT TO: the T.V. comes on at the start of a documentary about grizzly bears.
                                             A voice-over begins a narration.

 CUT TO: close on TEDDY sitting in his cardboard box hotel.    Flickering light

 from the T.V. plays on his face.

                                                                              CUT TO:
 INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    KITCHEN - DAY

 Bean hangs up happily, then approaches the toaster, stuffs a pair of wet
 socks into it and pulls down the start lever. Satisfied, he now turns to
 the family.

                                         BEAN
               Now - can I help?

  They just stare, dumb-founded.

                                                                                      36

 EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY

 DAVID and BEAN arrive at the car and get in.          DAVID heads out of the drive
 at a reasonable speed.

 BEAN suddenly yanks on the hand-brake. DAVID's head hits the windshield
 with a sickening thud. BEAN reaches for and fastens his seat belt. He
 looks to DAVID. DAVID gives BEAN a pained look. What planet does he come
 from? He fastens his own seat belt while BEAN wonders why it's all taking
 so long.

                                                                              CUT TO:

 EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      CAR PARKING - DAY

 It's a rather fancy building. Like a little Guggenheim DAVID parks by a
 large, expensive, looking car. BEAN opens his door and it bangs-hard
 against the pristine body work.

                                                                              CUT TO:


 INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      RECEPTION AREA - DAY

 As BEAN and DAVID enter through the swing doors they meet ANNIE, the very
 bubbly girl in charge of entrance tickets at the reception cum shop counter.

                                         ANNIE
               Two dollars please.

                                         DAVID
               Annie, it's me.

                                       ANNIE
               Oh, right, yeah. (to Bean) two dollars please.

                                         DAVID
               No, Annie, no.    This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with
               us.

BEAN frowns.    That word 'doctor'.

                                                                           37


                                    ANNIE
            Oh, great. Usually we charge people two dollars to come in- but
            for people who work here, that would be 730 dollars a year, which
            is like, a lot of money, so we kinda like let them off. Hi.

BEAN smiles at her.

                                    ANNIE
            He doesn't like to say much does he?

                                    DAVID
            Right first time.

                             ANNIE
            I can understand THAT. Neither do I.

As BEAN and DAVID move on, BEAN gives ANNIE a 1ittle wave. She waves sweetly
back. She cocks her head to one side and watches him go. She likes Mr. BEAN a
lot.

                                                                      CUT TO:

INT. GRIERSON GALLERY. GROUND FLOOR- DAY

BEAN and DAVID arrive In the ground floor gallery. A few visitors are viewing
the paintings. The acknowledge ELMER, the huge, ex-army, Security Man, sitting
on a small chair by a wall, reading a newspaper. The pass two oldish ladies
inspecting a painting

                                    DAVID
            You'll notice, our clientele is not totally young. I sometimes
            worry they're not really getting to grips with the art on a deep
            aesthetic level.


Stay with the ladies as DAVID and BEAN head on.

                                 OLD LADY 1
            What do you think?

                                  OLD LADY 2
            0h yes - lovely - very nice.

                                  OLD LADY 1
               And what colour would you use for the curtains?

                                                                           38

                                  OLD LADY 2
            Well, I thought the sort of blue in this one. (she points to a
            gorgeous blue Matisse) And I thought the curtains in the bathroom
            would be nice in this yellow ....

And-they head on to a Van Gogh with a nice yellow in it.

BEAN stops to admire a painting. It is Pre-Raphaelite in style, depicting a
woman reclined on a bed in a castle chamber. She is wearing a chastity belt
fastened with a small padlock, her breasts are concealed under a draped flag.

It is a tasteful and romantic picture.

                                        DAVID
              Beautiful.    'HIS MISTRESS' by John Everett Millais, 1829 to 96.
              Know it?

BEAN shakes his head. It's the padlock he's interested in he points at it and
smiles. ANNIE walks up.

                                        ANNIE
              Excuse me.    Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you
              upstairs.

                                        DAVID
              Thanks, Annie.

ANNIE walks off back the way she came, looking at BEAN approvingly over her
shoulder.

                                        DAVID
              Better go.    Grierson hates people being late.

                                        BEAN
              Yes.   Ahm... think I'11 ...

He gestures that held like to tidy up a little. Brush his hair, etc. BEAN
waddles off after ANNIE clearly in need of relief. DAVID watches him go.

                                        DAVID
              Why me?

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN is catching up with ANNIE. She notices him following and coyly smiles to
herself. She stops, turns round and grins. She thinks he has come to say
something to her.

                                                                                  39

BEAN stops dead in front of her - then turns sharp left into the men's
washroom. ANNIE's smile fades.


                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.    GRIERSON GALLERY.   WASH ROOM - DAY

BEAN    comes out of a booth. He tidies his hair and tie in a mirror. He pushes
down    the pressurised tap to wash his hands. It splashes terribly. The whole
front    of his trousers are soaked. The last thing you want when about to meet
your    new boss. Damn!

There now follow a quick, complicated piece of business.

1/ BEAN spots a paper-towel dispenser. He turns towards it at just the moment
a man exits from a booth - BEAN turns back to the sink to hide his trousers,
as the man swiftly does his hands, goes to the paper dispenser, and takes the
last towel. Damn again.

2/ BEAN    now puts    his hope in a rolling    towel. But it's rather high. He has
to jump    to try to    reach the trouser.     At which point Another Man enters.
Jumping    BEAN has    been caught in a very    weird position. He pretends he has
.chosen    the Men's    Room as the place to    do his rather energetic exercise
routine.

3/ As the man leaves, he then tries to blow the patch dry with his mouth.
Another Man enters. Again, BEAN is 1 compromised - pretends it's even more
exercises. That man also enters a booth.

4/ BEAN suddenly notices the hand drying machine! He turns it on. A healthy
blast of warm air. Annoyingly, it's also rather too high. He tries jumping
and bouncing to get his waist to the right height. It's not going to work.
Brainwave! He climbs up on two sinks. Now the drier is blowing in exactly
the right place. BEAN sways to let the air cover the whole area. It's
working excellently.

5/ At which moment, one of the men exits from         a booth and sees him in the
mirror. BEAN is in an immensely compromising          sex-with-machine position. He
pretends he's there to change the light bulb         above, which he takes out calmly
and polishes. The man leaves, BEAN smiles.           But as he exits, BEAN's face
transforms - he's totally scalded his fingers         on the scorching bulb.

                                                                                   40


6/ BEAN rushes to the sink, puts his fingers under the tap, pushes on the
water - and soaks himself all over again. At which moment, DAVID enters,
exasperated.

                                          DAVID
                Come on!     Let's go!

 BEAN exits uneasily hunched to hide his wet patch.          They enter the corridor,
 and he spots a newspaper.

                                                                              CUT TO:

 INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

 BEAN and DAVID enter. It's        a warm, formal. office. On the wall behind the
 desk is a full-size, framed       poster of Whistler's Mother. On a white
 background, at the base of       the poster, a caption reads: 'THE GRIERSON
 GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S       MOTHER'. Elsewhere, the walls are full of
 paintings.

 GRIERSON and BERNIE look up from a computer screen at DAVID and BEAN, who
 is, rather weirdly, carrying a newspaper in fronts of his flies. GRIERSON
 approaches David, and shakes his hand.

                                      GRIERSON
               Ah, David. Finally. (CHECKS HIS WATCH DELIBERATELY ) And this
               must be our professor from across the sea.

                                       DAVID
               Yes, this is Doctor Bean.

                                        BEAN
               Actually I'm not .... er ...

                                    GRIERSON
             This is Bernard Schimmel. Bernie the Doctor.

 BERNIE offers his hand. BEAN has to do a nifty handchange to free up the
 correct hand for the handshake. The newspaper stays firmly in place.

                                THOMAS GRIERSON
             Ah ~ the Tribune - mind if I just ....

He reaches out to borrow the newspaper. BEAN has to squeeze in right next to
the desk and sit behind it, before he can hand the paper over   thus ensuring
the continued invisibility of the wet patch. GRIERSON studies the paper for a
second.

                                    GRIERSON
             Take a seat, gentlemen..... although before we settle - feast your
             eyes on these.

GRIERSON goes to a painting on a wall. DAVID and BEAN follow ~ BEAN about one
inch from DAVID's back, walking in perfect rhythm.

                                    GRIERSON
             Arthur Rackham. Originals of course. Got four of them. Check
             this out ... Venus and the Cat, Aesop's Fables. Isn't that
             something?

He heads towards said illustration on adjacent wall - and BEAN and DAVID
follow, still totally glued together. A strange sight.

                                       DAVID.
             They're beautiful, sir.

                                   GRIERSON
             Maybe. Hell of a price, I'11 tell you.     Anyway - down to
             business.

 They head back to the desk - but Bean, in a momentary lapse of concentration
 fails to follow. He's now stuck on the wrong side of the room, unable to
 turn around.

                                    GRIERSON
             Bernie was just showing me his new ideas for a cross-gallery
             computer system. Dr Bean - would you like to look at this? Very
             exciting stuff ....

                                        BEAN
             Ahm ... NO.

GRIERSON is slightly surprised.   But they persevere.

                                     BERNIE
             What I'm doing, Dave, is developing the ultimate user-friendly,'
             interactive public guide to the gallery.

Punching buttons on the computer, he reveals wonderful maps of the gallery,
and when clicking on sections of the map, graphic explanations of each rooms
contents.

                                                                                 42

Meanwhile.   Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room.    He moves

around the room, always facing straight to the wall. When he reaches the fan,
he switches it on: unfortunately it's a rotating fan - so to keep the wind on
his trousers, BEAN has to do a strange, rhythmic dancing movement, following
the arc of the fan.

                                       DAVID
           It's very good Bernie.

                                   BERNIE
           But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work
           oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the
           program to every room in the gallery.

                                     GRIERSON
             Not bad, eh?    What do you think, Doctor?   Ah.... Doctor Bean?

 BEAN turns, shocked to    have been observed. He looks down at his trousers
 and, HOORAY!, they're    dry at last. He's delighted, and moves back across
 the road towards them,    hands in pockets, in a big, confident, groin-
 thrusting, dry-trouser    boasting walk.

                                   GRIERSON
             Well, thanks for dropping by. Enjoy your stay with our Vice
             President and his family. They're simple people.-.but warm,
             yes, Doctor?

                                    BEAN
           I'm not actually... um...

                                   GRIERSON
             ... Settled in yet. I know. Plenty of time. Bernie, perhaps
             you'd like to take Dr. Bean on a tour of the gallery.

                                      BERNIE
           Absolutely.     This way, sir.

 BEAN displays his crotch proudly one last time before he and BERNIE exit.
 GRIERSON tries to fathom the strange man who just left.

                                     GRIERSON
           He's a genius, right?



                                                                                43


                                   DAVID
           Ah... He certainly has something, sir.

                                  GRIERSON
           Very pleased you've taken him in, David. At a time when no-one's
           job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.

                                   DAVID
           Yes, although, I really..... thank you. Yes, it's great to have
           him with us. The whole family's very excited.

                                     GRIERSON
           Glad to hear it.     Tell poor Mr Larson to come through, will you?

                                      DAVID
           You're not going to ....

                                  GRIERSON
           Sack him? David, what else can I do? This business is not,
           repeat, not breaking even. And David ... notice anything this
           morning?

 DAVID frowns then sees.

                                    DAVID
              You've tinted your hair? It takes years off you, sir.

GRIERSON beams.

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   RECEPTION AREA - DAY

End of the day.. ANNIE perks    up at the reception desk as DAVID, but
especially BEAN, approaches    from the gallery area. She has a pile of
tissues near-by and draws a    heart on one of them. She arranges it on the
counter-top where BEAN could    not fail to see it on his way to the exit.

                                      DAVID
           Goodnight Annie.

                                      ANNIE
           Night.

BEAN does not even notice her.    As DAVID heads for the exit, BEAN suddenly
sneezes.

                                                                               44

He reaches for ANNIE's love message and blows his nose on it. He drops the
tissue in a bin as he exits.

ANNIE sighs her disappointment.

                                                                        CUT TO:
EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BY PARKING LOT - DAY

(About 5 p.m.) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot. On the way, BEAN's
interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton mask,
performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture. BEAN lingers.

The MIME accosts a woman, pretending to brush dust from her clothes, comb
her hair etc. The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really. The woman
quickly moves on.

BEAN is intrigued. The MIME mimes climbing a ladder. BEAN goes up next to
him - and looks up. There's nothing there. He decides the MIME is a bit of
a tricky. This is confirmed when the MIME pretends he's locked behind a
pane of glass. BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary glass
wall, and hits the MIME's nose.

                                 CUT TO: DAVID watching bemusedly some way off.

The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last.    He

 takes a handkerchief from BEAN's pocket, and gets BEAN to guess which hand
 the hanky's in. It's not in the left. Not in the right. BEAN isn't the
 slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y from
 where it's tucked into the MIME's trousers - and heads away. As he moves
 off, the MIME touches h' on the shoulder. BEAN turns and the MIME starts a
 mocking gun duel. He draws his guns. BEAN is pretty unimpressed.

 The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw. 4 He turns ....

 But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all. In a brilliant piece
 of big mime, he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an Arnold
 Schwarzenegger movie. He sets up a pedestal - opens a case ~ lifts out a
 hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun. Then opens
 another case, and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it.

 The MIME is getting very frightened. Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary stool
 to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun. The MIME begins to run away. BEAN
 twirls in his imaginary seat, and lines up his sights, following the
 terrified MIME.

                                                                             45

 Finally, in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat, he
 fires. 10 seconds delay, and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death, 50
 yards away.

BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID, arms folded,
leans against his car. DAVID gets into his car. BEAN opens the passenger
door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door (same
as this morning).

                                                                       CUT TO:

EXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT - DAY

DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible.

                                      DAVID

             Okay. I'll get some steaks. Alison loves steak ... Wine - good.
             Candy? No candy. Alison hates candy. We gotta do this right,
             Bean, or ... (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble, okay?

BEAN nods.   DAVID gets out and heads for the mall.   Nearby woman tramp (BAG
LADY) goes   through a trash can.

BEAN tries to control himself but weakens. He plays with all the buttons and
switches on the dashboard; windshield wipers, lights. Then he notices a
throbbing noise ... He gets out of the car to investigate.

BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound. The e-empty convertible has its
engine running. BEAN notices the keys in the ignition. How stupid of
someone. He turns off the engine and takes out the keys. There are several
people returning to their cars with groceries. BEAN offers the car keys to
them as if to say: "Are these yours?"

[The following should take place at quite a speed, real drama.]

Then suddenly, A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction ' of the Mall,
weaving in and out of parked cars, with a small white carrier bag, assumedly
full of money. He wears jeans, a black polo-neck and, much to BEAN's delight,

a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask.      As far as BEAN's concerned, this is his old
friend, the MIME.

ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible and gets
in - but he cant find the keys to start it. He frantically searches all his
pockets ...

                                                                                  46


BEAN leans into shot.     He holds out the keys, grinning.

                                       ROBBER
             Gimme the keys!

BEAN runs away with them. Or doesn't! He is in mime mode - And runs on the
spot, getting faster and faster. The ROBBER approaches this obvious madman.
He is quite a tough, scary, and scared individual.

                                     ROBBER
             I said, give me the keys!

BEAN turns and holds out two hands, just like the MIME did to him. The
perplexed ROBBER picks one hand. Wrong one. He then.... pulls a gun and puts
it hard to MR BEAN in BEAN's face. Passers-by scream and fall to the ground,
the bag lady amongst them. Sudden harsh reality.

But not to BEAN. He simply takes the gun, and waves it in the ROBBER's face,
ticking him off for breaking the rules.

                                     ROBBER
             OKAY, OKAY - TAKE IT EASY!!!

BEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around. He does, sure this sicko is going
simply to shoot him in the head. But instead BEAN puts his back to the
ROBBER's back, and starts to count

                                        BEAN
              1,2,3,4, 5, 6,7,8, 9,10

He turns and gestures to the ROBBER it's time to draw.       By this time a crowd
has gathered.

                                     ROBBER
             But I haven't got a f.....

                                        BEAN
             Ssssh!!!!

He points out a small child, watching from behind a trash can.


                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   SHOPPING MALL.    EXT.   COFFEE SHOP ~ DAY

DAVID is hurrying back to the parking lot, with a bag of groceries, and a big
bunch of red roses.. He stops dead in his tracks as he spots something ...

                                                                                  47

ALISON and CHARLES are sitting up on stools, in the window of a coffee shop.
ALISON laughs at something that CHARLES says. Their body language suggests a
certain closeness. DAVID is saddened. He hurries away.

                                                                      CUT TO:
EXT.   SHOPPING MALL.   PARKING LOT ~ DAY

BEAN waves the gun at the ROBBER.

                                       ROBBER
             I haven't got a gun.

But BEAN is pushing him to draw.      Finally...

                                      ROBBER
                             Okay, okay, I'11 do it!

He draws. BEAN draws too. They fire. And BEAN really fires. To his
amazement. Onlookers scream. BEAN throws the gun away in startlement.

The ROBBER lunges for it ~ BEAN kicks it away, trying to help him avoid such a
dangerous implement.

The ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder. The
ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke - and
niftly swaps the ROBBER's bag, for one of the Old BAG LADY's bags. A few
dollar notes spill out of it.

When the ROBBER emerges with the keys, BEAN 's waiting to escort him to his
car. He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm around
the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them. BEAN removes the
ROBBER's mask as the picture is taken. Forgetting himself, the ROBBER smiles
for the camera.

The ROBBER, jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police car
sirens, jumps in the car and drives away. BEAN waves goodbye to the
convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up. COPS jump out.

DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses. What kind of hell has
BEAN caused now? But instead of trouble, he sees the passers-by are getting
to their feet, applauding BEAN and whistling! They crowd round the COPS
explaining what a hero BEAN has been.

BEAN hands over the gun to a COP. He doesn't really understand what all the
fuss is about. He notices the BAG

                                                                            48

LADY wandering away with her bags. Should he tell her that he has swapped one
of them for the ROBBER'S? No. He's getting too much attention to be bothered.
A COP comes up to BEAN. It is COP 1 from the airport scene.

                                        COP 1
                         Excuse me.    Mr. er ... Cabbage?

Sudden mutual recognition.

                                                                      CUT TO:

INT.   POLICE PRECINCT. INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT

Classic smoked filled room with street light cutting through half closed
Venetian blinds. Two or three DETECTIVES slouched in the shadows.

BRUTUS, the   huge    black detective from    earlier, sits opposite BEAN    at a table,
smoking. He    is    looking at a photo. A     close-up reveals it to be a    full length
one of BEAN   and    the ROBBER outside the    mall with the ROBBER's face    unmasked.
BRUTUS eyes   BEAN    for a while. BEAN is     terrified. BRUTUS taps the     photo.

                                         BRUTUS
              It's Eddie Guardino.     Go pick him up.

One of the DETECTIVES lazily leaves the room.          BRUTUS leans forward on his
elbows.

                                      BRUTUS
              Guardino fled the scene with 160 K, in a white plastic bag. We got
              the car. We got the bag. And we got 20 pairs of stinking
              pantyhose. (drags on his cigarette) Anything you wanna tell me?

BEAN looks at h4-m blankly.       BRUTUS holds up the photo.

                                      BRUTUS
              'Fraid I'm gonna have to keep this.

BEAN calmly takes the picture and tears it in half. He gives back the ROBBER
half and puts the other half, with himself on, into his pocket. BRUTUS glares
at him.

                                         BRUTUS
              Mr. Bean.     You lookin' to stay long in California?

                                                                                      49


BEAN grins.    At last.     A question he can answer.     He nods, happily.

                                       MR. BEAN
              Oh, yes.

                                                                                 CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.      KITCHEN - NIGHT

DAVID is talking to KEVIN. BEAN is there. In the background, Jennifer plays
with a computer game. DAVID is very animated.

                                         DAVID
              He was incredible.     This guy is fearless.     He has no fear.

                                      KEVIN
              That's one - way of looking at it.        You might also say this guy is
              brainless he has no brain'.

                                         DAVID
              Well, there is that ...

                                       KEVIN
                                    (TO BEAN )
              I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?

                                        BEAN
             Ahm....


                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   THE LEARYS' HOUSE.   KEVIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

KEVIN is playing an adventure game: `GOBLINS 2' [This game exists.] The
GOBLINS chuckle and make stupid noises that BEAN can imitate. A catchy piece
of music accompanies the game.

The computer monitor shows the inside of the WIZARD's house. KEVIN moves the
GOBLINS, and two little characters, FINGUS and WINKLE, around the room by
clicking on areas in the room with his mouse.

BEAN and KEVIN are both wearing pointed goblin hats made from newspaper.

                                                                                  50

                                     KEVIN
             It's so embarrassing. All the guys I know are on Goblins 3 and
             I'm still stuck with the lousy Wizard in Goblins 2.

 BEAN is interested in the computer because he likes the cute little GOBLINS.
 He gets his delighted face right up to the screen. He sings along with the
 catchy tune. KEVIN is getting frustrated.

                                        KEVIN
             Come on, winkle.

 KEVIN clicks on a cuckoo clock in the WIZARD's room.       The cuckoo pops out
 holding a key in its beak.

                                        KEVIN
              It's gotta be here.     Something to get the key away from the
              stupid cuckoo.

 BEAN scans the monitor screen: he spots a little frog at the bottom of the
 scene. His eyes light up. He takes the mouse and rapidly and repeatedly
 clicks on the frog.

                                        BEAN
                       Click, click, click, click, click ...

 The frog croaks and jumps off a little round stone.       KEVIN gets excited.

                                        KEVIN
              How'd you do that!?     That was so obvious!!!

 BEAN grins and makes WINKLE pick up the stone. Then he clicks through to
 inside the wizard's house. He makes WINKLE throw the stone at the cuckoo
 which instantly drops the key from its beak.


                                     KEVIN
             Beanie, you are waaaaay Cool!

 KEVIN slaps BEAN on the back.      BEAN is delighted.   Close on monitor, showing
 The Goblin game-

                                                                         CUT TO:

 INT.   LIVING ROOM.    DAY

 Another game. JENNIFER'S Super Nintendo game on TV in the lounge area. It
 is a Gothic game where he-man types attack Vampires and bats with swords.

                                                                              51

DAVID is in the kitchen - setting out the roses in a vase.    The door opens -
enter ALISON. Some tension.

                                      DAVID
            Hi,

                                      ALISON
            Hi..... (PAUSE ) Roses.

                                    DAVID
            Yes. And    I have a wine for dinner
            that will kill you.

                                    ALISON
            Great. ( SHE SETTLES A LITTLE ) You said you'd ask Grierson about
            putting our guest somewhere else. Did you?

                                      DAVID
            Sort of half.....

                                      ALISON
            Meaning?

                                    DAVID
            I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have
            asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.

                                    ALISON
            Honestly David, you're so spineless.

Pause. Jennifer looks around.   She can't help but hear.   Not a happy
experience.

                                      DAVID
            Roses.     Wine.

He is asking her for softness. Pause. At which moment BEAN enters wearing
pointy hat. He helps himself to a melon from a bowl. He grins and exits.
ALISON looks at DAVID sadly.

                                      ALISON
              But no real change.

Almost instantly, BEAN is back. He rummages through a drawer and takes out
some large elastic bands. And leaves.

                                    ALISON
            I really do need some time on my own. Away from here.

                                                                              52

                                     DAVID
             Look, Bean's history. I swear to you, he's packing as we speak.
             And you can't leave. ( HE PICKS UP THE BAMBI ) I've got Bambi.
             You never go anywhere without him. Please let's just talk.


                                     ALISON
             Okay. ( GHOST OF A SMILE ) Put Bambi down, and we'll talk.

He puts Bambi down on the side-table, on the flat surface of his CD player.
BEAN appears again behind her, now looking even madder. Pointy hat, large
pointy ears made from melon peel, held in place by the rubber band stretched
round his face ~ huge front teeth also cut from the melon. He grins
gleefully.

DAVID and ALISON just stare. BEAN is followed by KEVIN who wears the same ears
and teeth.

                                     DAVID
             Look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... Jennifer -
             could you turn that damn thing down.

It is quite loud. JENNIFER looks for the remote control. BEAN helpfully picks
up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room.

                                     ALISON
             No, that's not for the TV. That's for the ...

Too late! BEAN punches a button and the lid of the CD
player launches the Bambi into the air.

DAVID sees it. In slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it.         It
smashes on the floor.

BEAN raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts.        He thinks DAVID
is a real Butter Fingers.

JENNIFER, upset, has found the TV remote and unintentionally switches from the
Vampire game to a TV channel. It's very loud.

ALISON gives DAVID a tearful look, and shakes her head.

                                                                             CUT TO:

EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE      NIGHT.

A taxi drives away.      Alison is in it.
                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HALLWAY- NIGHT.

JENNIFER and KEVIN are in their night clothes. They sit with David on the
stairs ~ still looking at the door-Alison left through.


                                           KEVIN
                I wish I    could use    that at school. "Hey, Teach, no hard
                feelings    ... It's    just things between us ain't what they used
                to be and    I need a    little space, ya know? So I'11 see you
                around in    a couple    of years, maybe".

                                    JENNIFER
             It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.

She gets up and walks away.

                                     DAVID
             Jen - you don't wanna talk about it?

                                    JENNIFER
             It's you and Mom that need to talk.

                                        DAVID
             Sure.    You're right.

                                     KEVIN
             You know, Mr. Bean's okay. You're not gonna kick him out, are
             you, Dad?

                                      JENNIFER
                                  (FROM HER DOOR)
             Of course he is.

                                        KEVIN
             Are you?

                                        DAVID
              Yes, I am.    I must.


                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   HALL/BEAN'S ROOM.   DAY.


DAVID heads for Mr BEAN's room, and knocks cautiously on the door.

                                                                                 54

                                         BEAN
                                      (o. o. v)
             Enter.

 DAVID enters - Camera follows as DAVID finds his way through BEAN's washing
 hanging from strings across the room. BEAN is sticking things in a picture
 album.

                                        DAVID
             Hi, am I disturbing you?

 BEAN gives him an affable smile. In a pause before he quite gathers himself
 to broach the difficult subject, DAVID asks a polite question.

                                        DAVID
             May I?

 BEAN acquiesces. He starts from the beginning, with pictures of him as a
 kid. Always standing on his own.

 Picture of BEAN with mop of frizzy hair, at 16.    DAVID smiles.   BEAN mimes
 stupid disco dancing.

 DAVID turns another page. It is a sequence      of pictures of BEAN at famous UK
 locations - Big Ben, Stonehenge, Buckingham     Palace, 10 Downing Street. They
 are .idiosyncratic because all taken by him     at arms length with his Polaroid
 - so he never quite makes it squarely into     shot.

 A whole page of Teddy. Then three pages of BEAN's mini with dates, on
 labels, going way back.

 Then a whole page of garden gnomes.

                                      DAVID
              None of your folks here - Family?

 BEAN starts to look for something in particular.      DAVID uses the pause to
 broach the awful subject.

                                      DAVID
              Look... the reason I came in here was to ... well... since you've
              been here twelve all...

 BEAN has    found what he was looking for. It is the picture of the family
 that he    took from the landing on his first night here. What's left of the
 Polaroid    of himself, from the mall, that he rescued from BRUTUS, is stuck
 next to    it. He's even written - 'Bean & Family' - he doesn't realise there's
 anything    sad about it. But DAVID is rather moved. Pause.

                                                                                 55

                                      DAVID
              Well, that's er...great. Look, I just came in ... (no, he cant do
              it) ... to say good night. Okay?

BEAN nods.    DAVID smiles and goes to the door.

BE-AN waves good-bye a little rudely and gets back to the album. Even when we
feel sorry for him, he's a little rude. DAVID walks away, shaking his head.

                                       DAVID
              Spineless.
                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   DAVID AND ALISON'S BEDROOM.

The first morning without ALISON.    "She's Gone" by Hall & Oats begins to play,
a song full of yearning.

DAVID feels the other side of the bed.    No-one there.

He walks into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Then walks back into the
bedroom - She's gone - I've got to learn how to face it " He takes a towel
from a cupboard and returns to the bathroom. He feels very alone.

He removes his pyjamas and gets into the steam-filled shower. - she's gone -
she's gone" - but the camera moves to reveal that he is not alone after all.
BEAN has, simply entered the shower, and is now happily soaping himself,
wearing ALISON's shower cap. manly screams from the both of them.

                                                                          CUT TO:
INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   CANTEEN - DAY.

DAVID sitting down at table, with BEAN, who is tucking in happily ~ eating a
burger & bun with knife and fork. DAVID speaks after a longish pause.

                                      DAVID
              Bean can I ask you something?

BEAN nods.

                                      DAVID
              Do you think you can ever really know someone? Even if you've
              known them, well, almost all your life? What do you think?

                                                                              56


 BEAN thinks hard, then looks at his watch, makes his excuses and simple
 walks away.

                                                                         CUT TO:

 INT.    GALLERY CORRIDOR.     DAY.

 BEAN at a pay phone.      He dials carefully-
                                                                         CUT TO:

 INT.    BEAN'S BED-SIT.     DAY

 10 am U.K.    time. (The following takes place in a matter of seconds) Close on
 the T.V. A    morning kids show blares out. A huge wardrobe stands four feet
 away from    a wall. There is a string tied to one of it's door handles,
 stretching    out of shot. The wardrobe seems to be leaning backwards at an
 angel. It     rocks slightly and creaks. (Feature its padlock).

 There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet, see-saw
 fashion. One end of it is wedged under the wardrobe.

 BEAN's G.P.O. phone rings on the table and it's vibrations cause the bust of
 BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table. It lands on the end of the
 ironing board. The Wardrobe groans as it is set off balance and falls
 against the wall with a heavy thump! and raising of dust. The string tied
 to its handle becomes taut.

CUT TO: the T.V. plug in its socket. This end of the string is tied to it.
The string tightens and the plug is yanked out of the socket.
The T.V. screen goes blank. Shot of TEDDY in the cardboard hotel'.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.    CANTEEN.   DAY.

BEAN returns, sits down and starts to eat again. David is still deep in
thought.

                                        DAVID

              Well, they say there's only one way to get over this sort of
              thing. Take it day by day. Keep working. Keep to your normal
              patterns. That's the only hope. So let's just ... take today
              shall we?

                                                                                57

BEAN nods.    He is not on David's emotional level here.

                                      DAVID
              I think the time has come from you to meet the grand Madame.
              She's all around you ... how do you fancy meeting her in the
              flesh?

 Sure enough, all around are posters, and the silhouette of Whistler's
 Mother. BEAN nods, though fairly distracted by the slice of gherkin he's
 found in his bun and now picks out with his fingers.

                                                                         CUT TO:

BEAN and David en route to the painting.

                                      DAVID
              I usually only let her out for the big summer exhibition - but'
              let's see whether what they say about the healing power of great
              works of art is true, huh?

                                                                         CUT TO:


 INT.    THE WHOLE GALLERY - DAY

 BEAN and DAVID do the rest of the journey, in quick cuts - along corridors -
 in an elevator. A sense of expectation and excitement. En route, they are
 joined by ELMER, the huge Security Guard.

 The three arrive outside a large oak door. ELMER ceremoniously unlocks the
 door, all the time glaring at BEAN - who swallows hard. A light turns green
 and a buzzer sounds.

 Then there is the door to the inner sanctum. ELMER stares at BEAN as he
 unlocks it. Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds.

                                      DAVID
              As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.   Nobody
              gets past Elmer here. Isn't that right?

                                      ELMER
              Not in one piece anyway. I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like
              my own dear mother. I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with
              her. The Vice President here will vouch for that.

                                                                                58


                                      DAVID
              You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me
              David?

                                      ELMER
              Not my place, sir. It would only be a matter of time before I'm
              calling you Dave. Then where would we be? By next year, you're
              my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo". I'11 be back in 15.

He salutes, glares at BEAN and walks away.        BEAN and DAVID enters the room.
BEAN looks warily back at ELMER

                                      DAVID
              You think he's tough you should see the size of the hunk that
              works the night shift.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      THE WHISTLER ROOM - DAY.

The room is very dark, only tiny lights in the corner.

                                        DAVID
              Stay there.    Keep your eyes closed. One final lock, one final key.

DAVID unlocks double doors in a wall with a plastic key card. Buzz - click!
The camera holds on BEAN, his eyes tight shut. The lights go up on BEAN's
face, a magical golden glow.

                                          DAVID
              Right.   Open now.

Cut round - and there is this beautiful and very famous painting, lovingly
shot. Music. Atmosphere. Glory.

BEAN opens his eyes and looks at the painting.

                                          BEAN

              Mmmmm. Nice.

                                      DAVID
              I'11 leave you with her for a few minutes. I'm sure you'll want
              to give her a proper inspection. But whatever you do, don't leave
              the room. Megasecurity, okay? Catch you.

BEAN nods. DAVID leaves him.         BEAN is still for a while and then goes up and
inspects it closely.

                                                                                    59

He tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame. He blows
it away fussily. He steps back to admire the painting. There is dust up his
nose and... SNEEZE - all over the painting!

He takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic. Then looks
back at the painting. Unfortunately, there now seems to be a big blue mark
right across Mrs Whistler's face..

BEAN checks his handkerchief. Yes, there's wet ink all over it. He finds the
leaking pen in his pocket. 0 God. He takes out his shirt, spits on it and
tries to wipe the painting, but he can't make the shirt reach it. He takes
the painting down from the wall and has another go. NO GOOD! The ink just
spreads right over Whistler's Mother's pure white collar.

BEAN    now looks round in panic. What the hell can he do? He goes to the heavy
door    - and looks out into the corridor. He hears someone coming, hides and
sees    a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly squeaky trolley
past,    covered with a white cloth.

He goes back in - and has an idea.        He goes to a little table in the corner
and begins to take thing off it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.     GALLERY.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY.

The    door opens, and    BEAN emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered
with    a white cloth.     Although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually
has    no legs. It is     the painting covered with the table cloth. To make it a
bit    more convincing,    BEAN makes an apt squeaky noise.

He proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly similar
trolley coming right towards him.' A problem. As they get close, BEAN
suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming man.

                                            BEAN
                                     (silently mouths)
                What the ... !!!

When    the   man turns, BEAN just twists his painting sideways and shoots past
him.     We   see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when he looks
back    and   BEAN is no longer there. He turns round to BEAN, who turns back to
him    with   a totally blank and innocent look. BEAN sees an elevator and heads
for    it.

                                                                            CUT TO:

                                                                                    60

INT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.     ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator, BEAN relaxes for a moment. He leans the painting against
the wall and presses the third floor button. The bell dings.

                           ELEVATOR VOICE
                Second floor.

BEAN manages to get the painting into trolley position before the doors open
to a group of six very fat middle aged people. They all wear large badges
declaring them to be members of a 'Diet Club'. They squeeze into the elevator
along both sides of BEAN's trolley. There is a very, very, THIN WOMAN behind
them who can't fit on.

                                      THIN WOMAN
                I guess I'll see you up there, guys.

The doors close. As the painting is wedged against the fat people's stomachs
on both sides, BEAN is able to let go of it and make a great show of checking
his watch. He nonchalantly, drums the fingers of both hands on the top of the
trolley'. The bell dings.

                               ELEVATOR VOICE
                Third floor.

The doors open. BEAN flips the painting onto its side and strolls out of the
elevator. The 'Diet Cub, members stare, after him.

BEAN heads on, squeaking - and at last sees what he's looking for.        A men's
room.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    MEN'S ROOM - DAY

BEAN enters, relieved. It is small, just a little sink, a towel and a toilet.
About a yard wide - but the picture fits in.

BEAN starts to wash the painting very carefully and lo!! The ink starts to
come off. Massive relief. Then, alas, someone tries the handle of the door.
BEAN speeds up. A knock. He peers out the keyhole. There are now 4 people
waiting. BEAN is very worried.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.-GRIERSON GALLERY.     OUTSIDE MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Pause. Then out comes BEAN, drying his empty hands, miming, "Sorry, Sorry.".
We see into the toilet. nothing there. No sign of the painting. BEAN turns
sharply left.

                                                                           CUT TO:
EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

DAVID is talking to BERNIE in the grounds.       We can see the side of the whole
gallery in shot as they talk.

                                        BERNIE
             I was hoping DU.     Bean might take a look at my computer project
             today.

                                    DAVID
              Yes. I'11 mention it to him.       But ... he's kind of his own guy,
              you know?

                                     BERNIE
             Howls he getting on with the family?

                                         DAVID
             Ah. Fine.     It's good.   It's great.

 We will be slightly distracted by      the observation that Whistler's Mother,
 America's most valuable painting,      is at this moment balanced on a very thin
 ledge three floors up - where Bean      has put in, outside the Men's room
 window. A bird and then a couple       more birds perch on it.

                                        BERNIE
             And howls Alison?

                                     DAVID
             She's ... well, she's good.

                                     BERNIE
             Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.
             Nice guy. Good looking.

                                         DAVID
             Yes, isn't he.

                                        BERNIE

             It's great when people who work together can become real friends.

                                        DAVID
             Isn't it?

                                                                                   62

                                     BERNIE
             I like to think that's what's happened with you and me ... even
             though you're kinda my boss. Still maybe it won't always be that
             way, huh?

DAVID doesn't quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely.

Now we see BEAN's plan -    he has emerged at a nearby window. He    can't reach
the painting at first.     So he stretches further and further out   the window.
No good. Finally he has     to go out on the ledge. He shoos away    the birds, who
then decide to settle on    him instead. Finally he gets a hand on    the painting.
As he does so, he loses    hold. He just manages to grabs a window    before he
falls.

                                     DAVID
             Look, I've left Bean on his own. Nice to chat though Bernie -
             always a subtle joy.

                                      BERNIE
             Thanks, David.   Always a pleasure.

Period.

BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window with the
painting. It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics. DAVID turns to go.

                                        BERNIE
             By the way. Don't     know what you think, Mr Vice President, but
             I've been hinting    to the old man that someone's got to have the
             balls to take some    sort of emergency measures around here - or
             we're all in the
             crap house. What     do you think?


                                     DAVID
             'Emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?

                                    BERNIE
             Not necessarily. That's where this ... ( POINTS TO HIS BRAIN )
             comes in. No, I've had a better idea than sacking people. You'll
             hear soon enough.

BERNIE grins and walks away. Bean does one final swing, and ....

                                                                              CUT TO:

                                                                                   63
INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.   STOREROOM - DAY.

A small storeroom where Bean's wriggling bottom is just coming back through
the window. He has the picture and is safe.

He sets the picture down on a table.      Darn!   The birds have done their
business on it.

He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles on a shelf. He
chooses a can, too rusty to read its label, takes off the lid and sniffs.
This smells like the right sort of stuff. He pours the liquid on to a rag and
rubs it on the face of Mrs. Whistler. The solvent effortlessly removes the
ink stain. Whistler's Mother looks as good as new.

BEAN is so, so, relieved. But then he notices something else happening.      The
liquid did not stop with removing the stain. It is now busy removing
Whistler's Mother's face entirely. As Bean watches-in frozen horror,
America's most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas.

BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought.     Removing the pen
that started all the trouble, he decides to try to draw back    on Whistler's
Mother's 'face. He doesn't have much time. It shows. Where       once was a
sublime oil painting, is now a biro line-drawing which looks    a little like
Danny de Vito.

Bean lifts it against the wall to check how it's worked. Unfortunately,
there's a nail there. The picture tears, Bean panics - it tears even more.
Total destruction.

                                                                         CUT TO:



 INT.     GRIERSON GALLERY.   CORRIDOR - DAY.


BEAN Hurries down the corridor with his pseudo-trolley again, and a vaguely
mad look on his face. He spots ANNIE at a drinks machine. She smiles sweetly
(here comes her man) BEAN takes a sharp left into an adjacent corridor. ANNIE
is hurt.

                                       ANNIE
               True love can be very hard.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   THE WRONG ROOM - DAY

Close on the double doors (identical to those of the Whistler Room) BEAN
enters with the Painting, under the

                                                                                 64

cloth. He closes the doors and rests a moment to catch his breath.     He takes a
step into the room and freezes.

The    very fat 'Diet Club, people are seated at easels, paint brushes poised.
The    very THIN WOMAN is standing in the centre of the room in her underwear
with    a Greek urn perched on her shoulder. All eyes are on BEAN, who exits
very    quickly.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.     INNER SANCTUM.   WHISTLER ROOM DAY.

BEAN gets back to the right rooms and closes the door desperately behind him.

He stands frozen for a second - and at that moment, a hand tries the door.

BEAN leaps at it and stops. the handle turning. Then there's a knock. BEAN
moves the big table in front of the door - he's barricading himself in.
There's a famous Rodin sculpture in there - he shoves it along to block, the
door as well. When he's succeeded, he leans hot and sweaty against it - and a
door on the other side of the room calmly opens and .... DAVID walks in.

                                     DAVID
             Seems to be a problem with the door.(PAUSE) Where's the picture
             gone?

                                       BEAN
             Ahm.....

                                       DAVID
             What?    What?

Pause.   Pause.    BEAN finally shows it.   Not a pretty sight.

                                       DAVID
             Oh Jesus. Oh God.     Oh Jesus God.   Oh Mary Mother of Jesus. Oh
             Jesus of Nazareth.

                                       BEAN
             oh dear.

                                       DAVID
             What happened?!!!

                                      BEAN
             Ahm.... (setting himself up for an interesting, comprehensive
             answer).

                                                                                 65

                                     DAVID
             Don't bother (panicking) Oh my god.....

He rushes to the door he just came in - and locks it.

             Wait a minute - why am I worrying about this? I did it. I just go
             out and tell them what happened - you're a madman from England and
             you did this terrible thing and it's not my fault. That's right,
             isn't it?

BEAN nods, knowing he deserves his doom.

             Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the
             picture?" And I say - "me". And they say "you're fired". And I
             say ' right'. And so I get fired and you go to jail and no one's
             any happier.

BEAN shakes his head.

             And then they say, "firing David isn't enough - let's prosecute
             him for negligence. And they prosecute me and it turns out I was
             negligent and I go to jail, and my wife leaves me and my daughter
             becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a cell with
             Butch McDick, the infamous gay rapist - or worse, I end up in the
             same cell as you!

BEAN looks hurt.

             No, no...Now, let's just be calm let's think about this calmly.
             (he tries - and fails ... ) Oh Godigodigod! Okay, now wait.
             Let's have another look at it.

BEAN shows it to him.

             Jesus!!! I'm already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as paradise.
             5 minutes ago - just walking along, shooting the breeze with my
             old pal Bernie.

BEAN then he has a brilliant idea. He hangs the painting back up in the
security cupboard and closes the doors. Then he removes from his pocket a
small note book.

                                                                               66



He scribbles something on it, tears the page out, licks it and sticks it on
the cupboard door. It reads `OUT OF ORDER'.



                                      DAVID
             Brilliant.   Brilliant. Problem solved!

BEAN is delighted.

             Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who opens the
             cupboard will say -"Look, someone's totally destroyed Whistler's
             Mother- let's kill them".

BEAN is less delighted.

              No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it.
              Ever again!

He locks the cupboard with his plastic card key-

               That's the first thing. Then ... that's the first thing....
               Next ... next is the next thing which is... obviously... ritual
               suicide. Look, let's get out of here. Try to act natural.

The let themselves out and go into the corridor- BEAN acting his version of
`natural' - very liquid.

                                                                       CUT TO:



INT.   CORRIDOR.   DAY-

They bump straight into GRIERSON and ELMER.

                                     GRIERSON
             Ah, David.   Showing Dr. Bean our good lady?

                                      BEAN
             Actually I'm not a...

                                    DAVID
            That's right - Whistler's Mother. Looking at his mother - not his
            father - not interested in his father, Couldn't give a flying
            doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother. Yes.


                                   GRIERSON
            Well, good - think I may go and look at her myself...


                                                                               67


                                     DAVID
            No!

                                   GRIERSON
            Er ... pray tell me why?

                                    ELMER
            Because they've just cut her into tiny pieces, sir.     That's why.

BEAN and DAVID die and go to hell until ELMER laughs at his own little joke.
GRIERSON laughs too.

                                    ELMER
            I better continue my rounds, sir..

He strolls away.

                                    DAVID
            The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very
            thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel
            the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.

                                   GRIERSON
            Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?

                                     DAVID
            Exactly.   She's in a surprisingly terrible state.    Isn't she,
            Bean?

                                     BEAN
            Oh yes.

                                    DAVID
            Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of
            paints ....

BEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing.

The colours are beginning to fade. However ~     if you give me just one little
year I can restore the picture to its original    glory, the way it looked when
Whistler's Mom first looked at it and said....    0 Actually I'm not sure you've
got the hair right, darling." By the way, your    hair is looking great today,
sir.

                                                                               68

                                    GRIERSON
            Thank you David.   However, flattery will get you nowhere.    Truth

             is, I have a rather different plan for Whistler's dear Mama.
             Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the long and
             short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...

                                        DAVID
             ... you have to sack me.     I understand, sir.    I'll go quietly.     In
             fact I'll go right now.

                                    GRIERSON
             No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've
             decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.

DAVID lets out a little yelp.

                                    GRIERSON
             Brilliant, huh? I already have a prospective       buyer - the current
             Governor of California, no less, who is flies      in tomorrow to
             inspect her and clinch the deal. Spread the       news. I think
             decisive leadership has done the trick, don't      you?

                                       DAVID
             Yes, sir.   Yes, sir.   Congratulations. Marvellous thing.     Bravo.

 GRIERSON leaves.    DAVID turns to BEAN.

                                        DAVID
             Bean.   Do you drink?

BEAN shakes his head.

                                        DAVID
              Neither do I.

                                                                            CUT TO:


INT.   BAR - NIGHT

It is very late and very gloomy. Just a couple of loners staring into their
drinks. The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the
sports pages. There is a T.V. on above the bar, showing baseball.

                                                                                   69

BEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar. The latter has had far too much
whisky and looks the worse for it. BEAN has a tall glass packed with fruit
and paper umbrellas. We can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he
has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. DAVID almost, but not quite,
slurs his words:

                                     DAVID
             It's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job -
             lose you wife ... C'est la vie. You ever been married, Bean?

He turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose.

                                        DAVID
             I guess not.

He fills his glass from a bottle.

            You know, I don't get it. The New Artist     exhibition-this year -
            people might not all have liked the dead    sheep, but ... the place
            didn't look that empty to me. It wasn't     full but I saw people. I
            just don't understand how the gallery can    be so bankrupt they have
            to sell the Whistler.

He looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril.
DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely ....

                                      DAVID
            He's English, okay?    You wanna make something of it?

BARTENDER goes back to reading. DAVID searches for his last train of thought,
taking a huge swig from his drink.

                                    DAVID
            ... To hell with the figures. I'm not a damn accountant. I'm an
            artist. You know, me and Ali met in art school? I cut quite a
            figure then. Far cry from the man you see before you now. Then,
            I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed, to help me sort out the
            problems of the world. Now, I take a spoonful of laxative before
            I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.

                                                                                 70


BEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick. He throws a peanut
high into the air - and catches it in his mouth. Then does two. Then does it
with his eyes closed. Actually, it's rather impressive.

                                    DAVID
             Truth is, I disappointed her. I turned out to have no spine.
             Spineless. A kind of medical miracle. Mr Flippy-Floppy. I
             just don't seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for myself.
             Too nice. I mean, I should never have let you come stay and I
             should be handing you over to the police right now. Shall I
             tell you something, Beanie ...

Bean has been interested all this, even looking to    check whether David does
indeed have no spine. But now the baseball on the     TV is making it hard for
him to concentrate on-this important confidence.     He raises a finger, for
DAVID to be quiet for a second. He blows a peanut     from his, nostril at the
T.V. - it hits the button, and changes station to    a pleasant quiet-music
station.

                                    DAVID
             Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?

 BEAN nods his head, very curious, listening hard.

             This is it. Because you moved into my house, my wife has left
             me. She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten ton
             weight that broke the camel's spinal column.

BEAN stares at DAVID - something is getting in he's actually registering this.

             That's point one. And point two - is that you've destroyed
             Whistler's Mother, which was' the last hope for the place where
             I work. So within a week, I'm going to lose my job as well.

BEAN nods, seriously dispirited.

                                                                                 71

                                     DAVID
             So, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. Do you
             understand? You've put me in a position where it would have been
             better if I'd never been born.

He puts his hand on BEAN'S shoulder.     BEAN looks down.

Very sad. This is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that
his actions have really effected the life of another person. BEAN looks up
sadly. Sad music plays.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   LEARY HOUSE.   DAVID'S ROOM - NIGHT

DAVID is asleep in bed.     The camera moves out into the hall and into BEAN's
room.


INT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.    BEAN'S ROOM- NIGHT.

BEAN is lying, fully dressed, in the darkness, on his back. Thinking.
Worried by what he's heard. Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes.      The
music is like his brain He jumps off the bed.

There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence. But
the 'tools' here are distinctly bizarre. BEAN picks up his suitcase, and in
quick cuts, rushes through the house and collects....

DAVID'S PLASTIC KEY CARD
A PAIR OF Y-FRONTS

A TORCH.
SOME OF KEVIN'S CHEWING GUM. 6 EGGS
A COOKING BASIN
A CUP
A LARGE PAINT BRUSH
A BOTTLE OF CLEAR NAIL VARNISH DAVID'S LARGE TIN OF LAXATIVE.     A HAIR DRIER
AN ACTION MAN DOLL
A POSTER OF THE GIRL AND HER BOTTOM WITH THE TENNIS BALL.

TWO OVEN GLOVES
A SKATEBOARD
AND 4 VOLUMES OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA.
Fully tooled, he snaps the suitcase shut.
                                                                         CUT TO:


                                                                                 72


EXT.   GALLERY.   NIGHT.

The building is floodlit by ground spots.

BEAN arrives silently, with suitcase, on the skateboard. Soon his full plan
will be revealed. The Gallery is empty, apart from the one Security Guard,

BUCK, visible through the glass front of the building, drinking coffee,
watching his 12 security monitors. BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK - he is
a massive gorilla of a man.

                                                                            CUT TO:


INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION - NIGHT.

BUCK is casually watching his screens, when suddenly, horror of horror, the
huge silhouette of a person hanging .themselves from a tree outside appears,
the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall. BUCK
frantically rushes out. And BEAN subtly slips in.

                                                                            CUT TO:


EXT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT.

BUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees. He finds nothing. Because he
fails to notice the tiny ACTION MAN swinging gently in front of one of the
ground-level floodlights.

                                                                            CUT TO:


INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT'.

Inside, BEAN is casually pouring the entire       contents of DAVID's large laxative
tin into BUCK's coffee. He also swaps two        keys on the board of keys by the
desk. He then takes the opportunity to put        the oven gloves on his feet, one
shaped like a pig, one like a crocodile, so       he can move silently.

BUCK returns. He sits down, and takes a long gulp of coffee. Pause. BEAN
watches. BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach. He takes a key
from his rack of keys, and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor screen,
BEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another monitor
BUCK is at full sprint. BEAN giggles.

BEAN is satisfied he'll be uninterrupted for a while. He goes to the key-
rack, borrows two keys, and sets off on his mission. The next 3 minutes of
film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios:

                                                                                 73


FIRST: BUCK - his next 10    minutes    are not happy ones. When he reaches the
toilet, the key he chose    does not    unlock it. He has to sprint back, grab all
the keys, and charge back    again to    the door. Then he has to try out every
single key. We never see     him find    the right one.

SECOND scenario - all the    activities of the night shown on the security
monitors. BUCK sprinting     desperately through shot - BEAN casually going about
his business and, on one    occasion, BUCK running right past BEAN, but not
seeing him - he has other    things on his mind.

THIRD scenario - we actually see BEAN's Big Plan.

He unlocks the merchandise shop. So he can see properly and have his hands
free, he puts the y-fronts on his head, and wedges the torch into them, like a
head-lamp. He then takes a poster of Whistler's Mother and replaces it with

the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl. He unrolls the Whistler and places the 4
encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down.

He separates the yokes from the eggs, mixes the whites with clear nail varnish
and varnishes the-poster with it. Dries it off with the hair drier.

,With the now stiff poster, he heads up elevators and escalators to get to the
Whistler Room itself, all the time chewing gum frantically. Once there, he
unlocks the final cupboard with David's plastic key, takes the Whistler down
and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame, and its wooden support
frame. He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old frame.

He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security cupboard and
relocks it with DAVID's key card.

The job is done.     He scrunches up the old, torn picture, pops it in a dustbin,
and heads off.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT. STREET.    NIGHT-

BEAN zipping along on the skate board with his suitcase.

                                                                           CUT TO:

BUCK, trouserless, is sitting, reading a newspaper next to a noisy washing
machine.

BEAN lies back in bed with quiet satisfaction.

INT.   DAVID'S ROOM.      MORNING.

DAVID wakes with a violent start.

                                       DAVID
               0 my God. Tell it vas a dream.

 The door swings open.       It is Bean with a tray of coffee and toast.

                                            BEAN
               Morning.


                                       DAVID
               It wasn't a dream, was it. I have to go in to work and tell them
               Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.

                                            BEAN

            Well, Ahm....

 He laughs cheerily.

                                         DAVID
            What?

                                                                           CUT TO:


 INT.   DAVID'S CAR.

 Bean is still chuckling.

                                                                           CUT TO:


 INT.   GALLERY.    CORRIDOR.

 Still highly amused, BEAN      guides DAVID in the direction of Whistler's Room.
 David takes out his key to      open the room - but the door swings open. DAVID
 is shocked. There stands       GRIERSON, looking straight at Whistler's Mum. In
 all its untorn, unsmudged,      undestroyed glory.

                                                                                75

                                   GRIERSON
            I think you're wrong, David. She looks as fine as she's ever
            looked. Worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.

                                         DAVID
            Ahm....

                                  GRIERSON
            Bravo. Let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?       Don't want
            anything to go wrong.

                                         DAVID
            Quite right, sir.

Grierson leaves.    David gets close to the painting and peers ....

                                         DAVID
            Wait a minute.

BEAN just puts his finger to his mouth...

                                         BEAN
            Ssshhhh.

He lets out a hug smile - he can solve the problems of the world, as well as
create them.


INT. THE LEARY HOUSE. HALL- SATURDAY

JENNIFER skips down t-he stairs, carrying a trendy duffel bag, just as DAVID
enters from the kitchen.

                                       JENNIFER
            Bye, Dad.

                                     DAVID
             Ah ... Jennifer, I need you to watch Kevin.    Jen?

But JENNIFER has already reached the front door ....

                                      JENNIFER
             Be serious, Dad.    It's Saturday.

She exits.

                                                                          CUT TO:

EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE - DAY

JENNIFER is heading down the path.    DAVID runs out of the house and catches up
with her.

                                     DAVID
             Jen, you have to help me here! I've got to go in to work, and
             with your mom away ... I really need you.

A powerful motorbike turns into the drive at speed and skids round to face the
opposite direction. JENNIFER runs over to it. The bike's rider turns off his
engine and removes his helmet. It is STINGO, the white Rasta from the
airport, with the hair extensions and the sixty rings in his nose.

                                      STINGO
                                    (to DAVID)
             You.

He hands JENNIFER a helmet.

                                      JENNIFER
             Don't worry, Dad.    I'll be home. Monday, after school.

BEAN and KEVIN arrive at DAVID's side to spectre.

                                     KEVIN
             Hey, En, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna
             look just like its handsome driver.

                                     DAVID
                                  (angry now)
             Jennifer! This is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this
             family. I've told you never to get on one of those death traps!
             Please - talk to me. I promise to be reasonable.

JENNIFER has put on the helmet and is climbing onto the back of the bike.

                                    JENNIFER
             Great, Dad. You promised you'd get rid of him! (points at Bean)
             And as for: "how we do things in this family. We don't have a
             family till you get Mom back.

                                                                               77

She slaps STINGO on the shoulder.    STINGO kicks the starter lever.    Nothing.

Again.     Nothing ...


                                        JENNIFER
               Come on Sting!

                                        KEVIN
               Sting?!   Sounds like something you put on a rash.

STINGO is still kicking the starter.       DAVID is desperate.

                                       DAVID
               Don't just stand there, Bean - do something.

BEAN instantly takes on the hero's mantle and runs to the bike. DAVID is not
far behind him. STINGO is still trying to kick start it. BEAN takes out a
small screwdriver and twiddles with something on the engine.

The bike sparks into life and does a wheelie before speeding out of the drive
and down the road. BEAN stands, hands on hips, looking very-pleased with
himself indeed.

                                          DAVID
                To BEAN )    Right! Right! You get inside and look after Kevin!
                (not such    a good idea) Uh --- Right! Kevin. You get inside and
                look after    ... uh... (that would be a worse idea) Right! Get in
                the car!     Both of you. Jesus!

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.     THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    RECEPTION AREA - DAY

DAVID, BEAN and KEVIN at the reception desk.

                                         ANNIE
               So, Kevin.    How's it going?

                                         KEVIN
               Badly.    You wanna adopt me?

ANNIE smiles cutely at BEAN.       DAVID is still rattled.


                                          ANNIE
                Big day today, huh?
                                                                                  78

                                          DAVID
                Uh ... yes ...

DAVID looks askance at BEAN.       BERNIE hurries up and takes DAVID to one side.

                                       BERNIE
                Great day. At last we can start getting out of debt and
                concentrating on the future.

                                       DAVID
                Yes, look, I wanted to talk to you about this.      I'm sure we
                haven't been doing as badly as all that.

                                         BERNIE

              You're an innocent and an optimist David - that's why I love
              you. (he hugs him and laughs). Jesus - what a terrible tie-
              Come on, the Governor's coming at 3. And before then I have a
              little surprise for you and the Boss.

 DAVID calls to ANNIE.

                                     DAVID
              Annie ... would you look after Kevin? And Kevin - you look after
              Bean.

He heads off with BERNIE.     Back at the counter.   BEAN, KEVIN & ANNIE.

                                     KEVIN
             My Dad told me all about you.

                                       ANNIE
             Did he now?

                                     KEVIN
              He says you've got a babe count of ten out of ten, and a brain
              cell count of about two and a half.

                                     ANNIE
              Yeah, I'll go with that. I'm kinda, like, dumb, intellectually.
              (to Bean) But I'm great in bed.

BEAN is unsettled by this.     He gives a shudder and heads for the gallery.

                                                                                 79

             Catch you later, babe.(goes after Bean) Come on, Beanie - there
             must be a computer here somewhere. I hate paintings. They don't
             do anything.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.    DAY.

BERNIE, DAVID and GRIERSON. BERNIE looks very confident at a computer
monitor. A painting is in fact 'doing' something, on the computer screen, as
the girls in a Toulouse-Lautrec painting actually dance the can-can.

                                      GRIERSON
             Well, congratulations.    Isn't that great, David?

                                       DAVID
             Certainly is.

                                     BERNIE
             We'll be able to start this afternoon. I'11 pipe the guide to
             every video screen in the gallery. Now, that'll impress the
             Governor.

                                   GRIERSON
             Well, bravo! What with you and Whistler's Ma - I think I've got a
             winning team.

DAVID slightly embarrassed not to be included in the winning team.      He looks

to the poster of Whistler's Mother behind GRIERSON's desk.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY

KEVIN and BEAN have found a computer,    also showing BERNIE's Gallery programme.
The monitor shows the interior of the    ground floor of the gallery. KEVIN
clicks, and up comes the same Toulouse    Lautrec picture. As KEVIN works the
mouse, BEAN hums the catchy tune from    'GOBLINS 21. It's play time again.

                                     KEVIN
              This is way cool, Beanie.

He clicks again, and a tiny talking Toulouse Lautrec starts to explain the
provenance of the painting.

                                                                              80

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   THE WHISTLER ROOM. DAY

DAVID is overseeing things. There's a burgundy rope, keeping people a bit
away from the case in which Whistler's Mother is contained. ELMER brings in
two large flower displays. BERNIE enters.

                                     BERNIE
             Jesus! Hurry up you guys. Am I the only person round here who
             actually gets things done.

He exits. BERNIE is growing in confidence - and getting nastier by the
minute. DAVID pulls a face at ELMER.

                                     DAVID
             You arrange those flowers yourself?

                                      ELMER
             Sure did.

                                      DAVID
             They're pretty.   Learn it in the army?

                                     ELMER
             No - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands,
             you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

The final touches in the preparation for the big visit to up-tempo, "we're
getting ready" music.

1.    Gardeners gardening, window cleaners cleaning, polishers polishing etc.
And someone empties a dustbin, in the midst of which we glimpse something
which might be a scrunched up old Whistler painting.

2.    BERNIE watches as someone plugs in a plug - and a huge video screen in
the gallery flickers and starts up.

3.    ANNIE at her counter, reading a book called 'The Art of Conversational.
She shakes an imaginary hand and rehearses a keen conversation with an
imaginary V.I.P.

                                                                                81

4.    ELMER, in the men's room mirror, trims his hair around his peaked hat
with scissors. He has a row of war medals on his chest. He polishes them
proudly with his sleeve.

5.    GRIERSON watches through the front glass - a red carpet rolls itself out
from the gallery's main entrance to stop by the rear door of a black car.

                                                                         CUT TO:


EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

Close on the bottom    of the black cars rear door. It opens and a pair of legs,
wearing black shoes    and charcoal trousers, step out onto the red carpet. As
they walk purposely    up the carpet, the camera pans up their owner's body, to
reveal that this is    BERNIE. It's a rehearsal. He is met with a hand shake by
GRIERSON at the main    entrance.

                                    GRIERSON
             What a pleasure, Governor Reynolds. I'd like you to meet some of
             our staff here. (checks a prompt card).

                                     BERNIE
             And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.

                                      GRIERSON
             Right.    Got it.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.     RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Gallery staff wait, all wearing name badges. GRIERSON leads BERNIE to the
reception counter. ANNIE steps out from behind it and shakes BERNIE's hand.

                                     ANNIE
             Good day, Governor Reynolds. I'm Annie ...

                                       BERNIE
             Curtsy.

                                     ANNIE
             Curtsy? Are you kidding? This is 1990s America.      Women don't
             curtsy, they run the damn country!

                                                                                82



                                      GRIERSON
           Alex, please!

                                       ANNIE
           That's Annie, sir.

GRIERSON takes BERNIE on to ELMER who is next in line.

                                    GRIERSON
             This is Elmer, our longest serving...

                                     BERNIE
             Hey. Let's junk the medals, Elmer. This is not a Veterans'
             reunion. We wanna make the Governor feel at home. Not remind him
             of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.

ELMER puts on a defiant face. DAVID shakes his head disapprovingly.        GRIERSON
moves BERNIE to meet DAVID. They

'Shake hands.

                                     DAVID
             David Leary. I'd like to echo my colleagues welcome to you and
             thank you for your patronage ...

BERNIE rudely cuts him off.

                                     BERNIE
             Okay, that'll do. The Governor's here in half an hour.       We have
             to be totally ready then. No excuses. Period!

                                    GRIERSON
             Thank you Bernie. Well done. Now, If you'll excuse - I have a
             little smartening up to do myself.

                                                                           CUT TO:


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    BERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

BEAN at the computer. He's actually quite enjoying himself now. In fact,
he's rather hogging the thing. This is, after all, an animated catalogue -
his area.

                                                                                83

                                     KEVIN
             I'm just gonna go see if Annie needs me for anything.      Truth is,
             she smells kinda nice. okay? (grins).

BEAN smiles and gives KEVIN a thumbs-up.       KEVIN returns the gesture and
exits..

Back to the computer, BEAN clicks on an icon which takes him to the ground
floor gallery. He clicks through various paintings and stops at the painting
of the woman, in the castle, wearing the chastity belt. BEAN clicks and
enlarges the painting to fill the screen.

He happily hums the catchy tune from 'GOBLINS 2' and homes in on the tiny
padlock on the chastity belt. Padlocks interest him. He clicks on the
keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in GOBLINS 2).

                                     MR. BEAN

             Click! click! click! click! click!

.Suddenly, to BEAN's surprise, the padlock starts to flash red...then the
whole screen starts to flash ... before going dramatically back to black ...
Now flashing in the .centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key. Beneath
it, a row of six dashes appears (e.g - - - - - - - ). A cursor is flashing
over the first dash.

BEAN is totally absorbed. He loves these kinds of puzzles. With one finger,
he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some of
them). As he does so, they appear over each dash in turn:

                                 G-O-B-L-I-N
A message pops up: "ACCESS DENIED" BEAN tries something 0 else.
                                 G-N-O-M-E-S
The message again: `ACCESS DENIED'. The room door suddenly opens! Making
BEAN jump! It's BERNIE. He cannot see the computer screen from the doorway.

                                       BERNIE
         How goes it, Bean?    Ready for the Governor?

BEAN smiles and nods nervously.       He knows he's probably up to something he
shouldn't be.




                                                                                   84


                                    BERNIE
           We need you downstairs in ten minutes and not a second more.
           Period. Oh, And put this on.

BERNIE throws BEAN a name badge with 'Dr. Bean' on it. BEAN nods. BERNIE
exits. BEAN goes back to the code. He types in the first thing that comes
into his head:

                                      B-E-R-N-I-E

That damned message again: `ACCESS DENIED'.         Then, as though something is
dawning on him, he punches in:

                                      P-E-R-I-0-D

Up comes a message: "CODE ACCEPTED". Close on BEAN's face as light from the
computer plays on it- He reads it carefully and with interest. We cant quite
read his expression - but what he sees is a surprise and a puzzle. Long
meaningful pause as his eyes scan the screen.

                                                                             CUT TO:

BERNIE enters - DAVID is looking at Whistler's Mother, still puzzled.

                                        BERNIE
             David?   Lift off!

The staff and various dignitaries are lined, looking out through the glass in
anticipation. Through the glass we see a couple of Police Motorcycle Escorts
pull up outside followed by a beautiful, old, classic Rolls Royce.

                                                                            CUT TO:


EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY

The red carpet unrolls all the way to the Rolls, rear door. Close on the
bottom of the driver's door. It opens and out step a pair of legs, wearing
army boots and khaki trousers.

                                                                                    85

The legs step sideways onto the carpet and approach us. Camera pans up to
show us that GOVERNOR REYNOLDS is dressed in his Veteran's uniform - chest of
medals and forage cap. He is a grand figure. In fact - he's exactly the same
grand figure Mr BEAN caused epic problems To on the plane over. He gives his
prized possession, the car, a little token polish with his sleeve before
heading on.

BRUTUS and his SIDE-KICK COP fall into step behind him.       They are the Police
presence today.

GRIERSON and BERNIE greet REYNOLDS at the entrance.

GRIERSON is wearing a striking brand new light blue silk suit.       BERNIE is
frowning - not happy about that uniform.

                                    GRIERSON
             what a pleasure, Governor. Welcome.

                                    REYNOLDS
             Hi, Grierson, forgive the war paint.       Going on To my regiment/s
             reunion after.

                                      GRIERSON
             Not at all, Governor.    Very striking.

 REYNOLDS takes in GRIERSON's suit.

                                      REYNOLDS
             Interesting suit.

                                       GRIERSON
                                      (Beaming)
             Why thank you sir.

                                      REYNOLDS
              off the peg?

                                   GRIERSON
                                (crestfallen )
                Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...

He gestures to BERNIE but REYNOLDS cuts in and hands BERNIE a set of car keys.

                                    REYNOLDS
                                  (To Bernie)
             Go park the old jalopy, will ya, son.

BERNIE's smile melts away. As they enter the gallery, BERNIE hopefully offers
the car keys to BRUTUS - who rewards him with a "don't be stupid" smile and
follows the Governor.

                                                                                 86


BEAN (wearing "Dr Bean" name badge) comes into the corridor by the front door,
thus just missing REYNOLDS. BERNIE sees him and jumps on the chance to
delegate.

                                     BERNIE
             Bean - go park the Governor's car, will you.

 BEAN assents happily. BRUTUS spies BEAN over his shoulder and frowns - its
 that mad English guy again. BEAN gets to the door and sees the Governor's
 car. Yummy!

                                                                           CUT TO:

GRIERSON leads REYNOLDS to the reception counter, as BERNIE sneaks up to take
his position again. ELMER is in the background trying to look professional,
deferring to BRUTUS.

ANNIE steps out from behind the counter, curtsies and ,shakes REYNOLDS' hand.

                                     ANNIE
             Good day, Governor. I'm Annie.      You know, you're a lot taller
             than you were half an hour ago.

                                    REYNOLDS
             Well, that's great to hear at my age, Annie.      Thank you very much.

                                      ANNIE
             Governor Reynolds, does your wife, like, have to curtsy?      Or does
             she 0 have a decent job?

                                    REYNOLDS
             Er ... Mrs. Reynolds is doing just fine.      Just fine.

He spots KEVIN and winks at him.      KEVIN smiles back.
                                                               CUT TO:

BEAN has let himself into the car. It's one of the happiest moments of his
life, as he inspects the gleaming panel and sits back in the gorgeous leather
seat.

                                                                                 87


He starts the car up - and heads up into the circular car park. He sweeps
dangerously round a few turns - but just manages to keep the car in tact.
Finally he reaches the top floor where there is one quite small space left.

BEAN is a good driver in a car that is, unfortunately, one foot wider than the
one he's used to.

He takes out the comb he always used to measure space with his Mini, and
measures the space. Yes. Seems large enough. He moves the car in. It isn't
large enough.

With a hideous scraping of metal against metal, the Rolls Royce squeezes in
between the two cars, losing its wing mirror and door handle in the process.
BEAN looks a tadge concerned.

                                                                                CUT TO:

REYNOLDS has moved on to ELMER who salutes crisply.         REYNOLDS returns the
salute with pride.

              Nice set of medals there Elmer.      Which beach they drop you on?
              Utah? Omaha?

              Couldn't tell you sir. I was so drugged up with the killing I
              didn't know where I was.

                                     REYNOLDS
              Well, congratulations soldier.
                                                                                CUT TO:

EXT.    PARKING LOT - DAY.

BEAN sitting in the wedged car. He tries       the door - but it won't open a
centimetre. He's totally stuck. He looks        up at a small window in the roof.
If only he could get that open. He pushes      various buttons, which set of
windscreen wipers, squirters, radios. He       pushes the cigarette lighter.
Finally, he pulls a lever - and the bonnet      pops up an inch.

At which moment we see the lighter shoot out, and on to the seat. BEAN is
still looking round below the dashboard, when he notices a little fire in the
seat beside him. Not good news.

                                                                                     88


 BEAN panics a bit, turns and half      climbs over into    the back   seat, when he
 spies a drinks cabinet. He has a       very good idea -    he finds   a cut crystal
 decanter of brown liquid, opens it      and uses it to    douse the   fire. Not a
 wise move with brandy. Before the       cut, we see the    WHOOOSH!   of a major fire
 in the front seat of the car.

                                                                                CUT TO:

 INT.    THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   DAY.

GRIERSON leads REYNOLDS towards the main gallery. He points up to the video
screen they are passing, which shows the two of them walking along - as does
every screen in the gallery. REYNOLDS is impressed. He glances at DAVID in
passing.

                                        REYNOLDS

             Nice tie, fella.

DAVID grins to himself.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   PARKING LOT - DAY.

The front of the car isn't    what it was. There has been a big fire. It's out
now - three decanters lie    empty. BEAN is not happy. Finally, he decides to
go for brute strength. He     turns the car on again, puts it into reverse, and
puts his foot down on the    accelerator.

We see the car from above. Full throttle. Totally still. Totally still.
And then WHOOOOSH WHAM!!! It reverses at 100 mph straight backwards, smashing
violently into and destroying the back of the car behind _ as it happens,
Bernie's car.

                                                                  CUT TO


INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.    GROUND FLOOR - DAY

REYNOLDS stops to admire a small painting - a twelfth century 'Crucifixion of
Christ'.

                                    GRIERSON
             Ah, one of my favourites. It expresses a universal agony that the
             established Church so rarely acknowledges, don't you think?

                                                                            89
                                    REYNOLDS
             Jesus ... no one's got feet like for crying out loud. Have you
             got feet like that? Dammed if I have. Let's move it, shall we?

BERNIE spots a slightly concerned DAVID.

                                       BERNIE
             Everything okay, David?

                                        DAVID
             Yes. Ahm.      I was just wondering where my English house guest had
             got to.

                                     BERNIE
             He's just parking the Governor's car.

                                     DAVID
             Great - keep him out of trouble.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.   PARKING LOT - DAY.

BEAN is inspecting the car. He's not too happy with it. '.He tries to get
the bonnet down, but it insists on staying up. He shrugs his shoulders and
gets in to drive off again, having to wind down the window and drive by
leaning his head out. This means that as he heads for the exit, he fails to
see the system to stop people leaving without paying, a foot high barrier that
appears out of the ground. When he hits it, the car stops dead.

BEAN gets out,    leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where normally the
attendant would    be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment. Inside he
pushes a couple    of buttons, and, hurrah, gets the one that drops the barrier.
Less hurrah, he    has forgotten to put on the hand brake.

As he moves    back towards the car, it glides slowly down the ramp on the
outside of    the building, then accelerates, and finally, on a particularly
sharp turn,    smashes through the wall, and flies off the building. We hear a
crash - but    do not see where it lands.

                                                                            CUT TO:

GOVERNOR REYNOLDS turns away from another picture.


                                                                                 90

                                     REYNOLDS
              Can we go and see Mrs. Whistler now?      My eyes are making my feet
              sore, as my wife would say.

                                          DAVID
              Sure, Governor.   Please.     This way.

The party follows DAVID as he walks through the gallery, towards the double
doors, to take the lift to the Whistler Room. An excited atmosphere.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   WHISTLER ROOM.    DAY.

Everyone enters.

                                      DAVID
              Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistler's Mother
              before, can I ask you just to step back. Thank you.

It's part of his plan of caution - he knows there's something wrong - and
wants as few people as possible to .see the painting close up. The crowd
moves back.

                                      DAVID
              I'd like the Governor to have, as it were, a private audience with
              his new friend.

REYNOLDS is flattered. Silence. DAVID inserts the plastic card key - opens
the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistler's Mother'.
Respectful silence.

REYNOLDS is delighted.     He stands back to inspect her.

                                     REYNOLDS
              Well, hello Ma'am! Yes - she certainly looks a million dollars to
              me - or should I say ten million dollars!

Everyone applauds.

                                     GRIERSON
              Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of, though I say it

             myself, rather 'expensive' champagne. (grins smugly)

                                                                               91

People start to file out. REYNOLDS, GRIERSON, BERNIE and DAVID stay behind.
DAVID spots BEAN arriving. He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a
slightly dazed smile. DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over.

                                     DAVID
             Governor, I don't believe you've met Dr Bean, our expert from
             England.

They turn to each other - recognition from BEAN "it's the man from the plane".
He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before REYNOLDS
recognises him...

                                      BEAN
             Ah, hello, sorry, I ... Ahm... sorry ...

BEAN turns. In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops anyone
getting too close to the great painting. He spins and falls in the direction
of the painting.

CUT TO: the looks of horror on all the faces.

CUT TO: BEAN, reaching out to keep himself standing. We think he's going to
tear the painting. He doesn't. He simply catches hold of the bottom of the
ornate frame. It ,,snaps off.

CUT TO: a look of relief for an instant on all faces.

CUT TO: the truth - as the frame breaks off, there is the little white strip,
saying, THE GRIERSON GALLERY, HOME OF WHISTLER'S MOTHER"-

CUT TO: a look of horror on all faces.

CUT TO: ELMER looking like someone has just murdered his own mother.

CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK glowering at BEAN.
                                                                       CUT TO:

Governor REYNOLDS storming through the Gallery, with -BERNIE and GRIERSON
scampering after him.

                                    REYNOLDS
             You were going to sell the State of California a poster - for ten
             million dollars! Who the hell do you think you are, Shorty!?

                                                                               92



                                    GRIERSON
             Look, Governor - just wait - it's may not be as bad as it looks
             ....

                                                                       CUT TO:

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.      WHISTLER ROOM - DAY.

DAVID and BEAN stand alone in silence, in front of the debris. BEAN is
absolutely destitute. DAVID stares at him. BEAN just lifts his hands.
Totally sad. What will, what can DAVID say to him? Finally, DAVID just puts
his hands on his shoulder.

                                        DAVID
             Nice try, kiddo.

BEAN cant quite believe he's forgiven. At which moment, there is a knock on
the door. ANNIE enters, holding KEVIN's hand.

                                      ANNIE
             David.   There's a call for you.    It's your wife.

                                    DAVID
             Great. Classic timing. Why don't you ask her just to leave a
             date for the divorce? I'll check my diary later.

Then he notices the worried expressions on ANNIE and KEVIN's faces.

                                      ANNIE
                       She's calling from the hospital ...

BEAN and DAVID both take this in.      DAVID turns and runs towards the reception
area. ANNIE calls after him.

                                        ANNIE
             She's on line three!

KEVIN grabs BEAN's hand and they both run after DAVID.      ANNIE watches BEAN go
and sighs.

                                        ANNIE
             Such... great buns.

                                                                          CUT TO:

INT.   GALLERY ENTRANCE HALL.   DAY.

The party is in disarray. In the background, DAVID is on the phone at the
reception counter with KEVIN and BEAN. BRUTUS hovers, he suspects BEAN -
wants to question him.

                                    REYNOLDS
             I've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more
             intelligent than you two. Not only have you failed to protect
             your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even
             know it'd been stolen! I'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who
             sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you
             guys.

                                    GRIERSON
             I am sorry you feel that way.

                                    REYNOLDS
             And I'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.     That suit stinks and
             you obviously dye your hair.

GRIERSON is seriously shocked and offended.

             Now, bring my car round the front please - I've had enough of this
             crap!.

                                         BERNIE
             Certainly, sir.

He rushes off. Meanwhile, DAVID slams down the phone and he, BEAN and KEVIN
rush out of the building. ELMER, BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK give chase.

                                                                              CUT TO:

EXT.   GALLERY PARKING LOT.     DAY.

DAVID's car screeches out onto the street and tears away.

BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK arrive, flustered, at their car.        SIDE-KICK is
frantically searching for its keys.

                                         BRUTUS
             Come on man!     Move it!

A car passes by them slowly.      ELMER is driving.   He shouts from his window.

                                                                                   94

                                          ELMER
             Hey, Cop, wanna ride?       Jeese, where do they get you guys?

The cops jump in his car while it is still moving.

                                                                              CUT TO:

REYNOLDS at the entrance.      BERNIE walks up sheepishly, holding up car keys.

                                     BERNIE
             There is one other tiny problem, sir.
                                                                              CUT TO:

DAVID's car speeds by.      ELMER's car is not far behind it.
                                                                              CUT TO:

INT.   DAVID'S CAR - DAY

DAVID is driving fast.
                                          KEVIN
             Is Jenny gonna be okay?

                                     DAVID
             She was wearing a helmet. It could have been worse.

                                     KEVIN
             But is she gonna be okay?

                                          DAVID
                                       (snapping)

             How the hell should I know?

KEVIN is hurt.

             I'm sorry. What can I say - she's unconscious. And I mean -
             every night when we sleep, we're all unconscious, aren't we?
             She'll pull out of it. God though - why the hell do kids have to
             ride bikes?

DAVID slams on the brakes.     He nearly went through a red light.

                                                                              95

                                     DAVID
             Damn! She's a good kid. Sometimes good people get a break once
             in a while. (manages a smile)

A chauffeur driven, open top limo, pulls up next to DAVID's car. BEAN looks
out of his window to see the BAG LADY, from the mall robbery, sitting in the
back. She is still wearing her filthy clothes. She raises a glass of
champagne to BEAN and smiles.

BEAN waves back uncertainly.     He's sure he's seen her before - a vague memory.

CUT TO: ELMER's CAR is in the traffic queue about ten cars back. BRUTUS and
SIDE-KICK get out and start running down the line towards DAVID's car.

The lights are green. DAVID puts his foot down and the car screeches away
just as BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK are within inches it.

CUT TO: BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK turn on their heels and head back to ELMER's car.
They are very unfit.

They are just about to jump in the car when gun shots are heard from a near-by
gas station- BRUTUS turns and sees a .robbery in progress. A man with a gun
is about to run away. BRUTUS is torn, not knowing which quarry to pursue.

                                      BRUTUS

             Shiiiit!

                                       ELMER
             It's okay!    I'll tail 'em!

                                      BRUTUS
             You got it.

BRUTUS and SIDE-KICK draw their guns and run towards the gas station. In a
moment of confusion - a shot rings out. We think in the corner of our eye
that we see BRUTUS fall to the ground, as ELMER screeches away after DAVID's
car.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.   RECEPTION - DAY

Much hustle and bustle. DAVID is getting directions from a nurse at the desk.
He beckons to KEVIN and BEAN and strides, purposely towards a corridor. They
hurry to catch him up, and Bean treat on the back of his shoe. DAVID turns
and shouts at him.

                                                                               96


                                      DAVID
           Just stay away from me!   D'you hear?

He takes KEVIN's hand and storms away round a corner. BEAN is taken aback not
knowing what to do or where to go. He is really feeling sorrow now. He's
shaken. All part of his slow coming to feel things properly.

                                                                       CUT TO:


INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY

DAVID and KEVIN turns a corner - and stop, frozen. There, sitting alone, on a
bench, outside JENNIFER's room, is ALISON. She gets to her feet. Their eyes
meet.

                                                                       CUT TO:


EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY -DAY

A crowd outside the gallery, look off camera. The camera follows BERNIE's
gaze and takes in the modern car sculpture. Where there were two cars face
down in the earth, there are now three, the new addition being Governor's
pride and Joy. The three cars form a tall pyramid.

Close on REYNOLDS' face. GRIERSON approaches.

                                    REYNOLDS
               Don't even think of saying one word to me, or I'11 find a way
               of fitting all three of those cars right up your ass.

  GRIERSON nods - he's got the message.

                                                                       CUT TO:



INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR. DAY

ALISON and DAVID are standing where they were before, three paces apart.
ALISON is upset, tired and drawn.

                                     ALISON
             They're not calling it a coma. The doctor says she's ... just
             kind of taking time out. (to Kevin) Hi, tough guy. (to David) It's
             a busy night. The doctor will be back in a while.

  A doctor passes

                                                                               97

                                     DAVID
             Excuse me.

                                    DOCTOR 1
             I'll be back in a minute.

                                           DAVID
              Okay, great.

 ALISON looks at him. We don't quite read the expression but somewhere under
 there we know she's thinking "yup, he's still ineffective."

                                     ALISON
              At least you didn't bring Mr Bean with you.

                                           DAVID
              Ah, well ....
                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - DAY

BEAN is looking for his friends.        A doctor sweeps by him.   A nurse behind.

                                           NURSE
              Doctor Jacobson?

                                      DOCTOR JACOBSON
             Yes?

                                     NURSE
             We need you urgently in C Theatre.

                                   DOCTOR JACOBSON
             Damn.     I was just going to Number 4 ....

                                           NURSE
             It is urgent, sir.

                            DOCTOR JACOBSON
             Okay.....

The doctor rushes away and drops his stethoscope as he .goes.         BEAN sees it,
picks it up and follows him he's trying to be useful.

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     RECEPTION - DAY

ELMER is at the busy reception desk and has been talking with a nurse.

                                     ELMER
             No, no, I didn't realise the situation.       I won't disturb them now.

ELMER is obviously moved to find out about JENNIFER. He moves towards the
exit ... He is surprised to see BUCK, the night-shift guard, dressed in
civvies, sitting with outpatients.

                                           ELMER
             Buck?

BUCK looks up, painfully, goes to say something, then dashes into a men's room
close-by. ELMER shakes his head and leaves.

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN still following DR JACOBSON, who goes through more swing doors and then
suddenly disappears. BEAN sees a big "4" above a door and goes in, holding
the Stethoscope. A nurse accosts him instantly. She reads his name badge.

                                       NURSE 2
             Doctor ... Bean?

BEAN is fed up trying to correct people with this misconception.

                                      BEAN
              Actually ... (huge sigh) ... Yes, yes, yes...

                                       NURSE 2
              Just in time, sir.     Allow me.

She immediately slips the white coat onto BEAN, and the gloves, and the mask.

INT.   HOSPITAL.   CORRIDOR - DAY

ALISON, DAVID and KEVIN are sitting on the bench opposite JENNIFER's room.
KEVIN picks up JENNIFER's SUPER NINTENDO console from the bench. DAVID
notices this. ALISON answers his look.

                                                                             99

                                    ALISON
           When the Police told me what had happened I ... it's stupid I know
           ... but I remembered all that stuff people do to get through to
           coma victims ...

                                     KEVIN
           Like playing them recordings of their dish washers and coffee
           grinders?

                                     ALISON
           That right.   So I went home and picked it up.

                                     DAVID
           Good thinking. (pause) You still call it 'home'.

ALISON looks at him seriously.


INT.   OPERATING THEATRE.   NIGHT.

Inside the operating theatre, a body is waiting in position. There are 3
attending nurses and an assistant doctor. They all look up to BEAN as he
enters, fully kitted up.

                                   ASSISTANT
             Good evening Doctor.. What we have here is a bullet wound in the
             lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung, and there's
             severe inner bleeding along the abdomen.

                                       NURSE 2
             He's coming round.

                                   ASSISTANT
             Give him a T 70, straight away.

The victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the first time.
It is the police officer, BRUTUS. He is in great pain. As the sedative shot
goes in, BEAN takes off his mask, and smiles, with a little wave. A look of
total panic goes over BRUTU'S eyes, as he loses consciousness.

                                   ASSISTANT
              Shall I do the cut, sir?

BEAN nods - he's not going to argue with anyone. The assistant cuts. BEAN is
horrified, almost faints, then snatches the knife. He can't believe this
maniac has just cut through another personas flesh.

                                                                             100


                                   ASSISTANT
             I'm sorry. it's only MY first week.

BEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily.

                                     NURSE
             I'm afraid we'll now have to wait for the X-rays, Doctor, or we'll
             never find the bullet. Come on everyone sort out the support
             systems.

EVERYONE turns to get on    with their particular jobs. BEAN is left with the
body. A pause. He gets      a little bored. Takes a sweet packet out of his
pocket. Only one sweet     left. he takes it out lovingly, and then does what he
always does - throws it    up into the air, to catch it in his mouth.

Unfortunately, he forgets that he is wearing a mask.     It hits the middle of
the mask and bounces into the cut in the body.

BEAN looks down annoyed. Checks round him - everyone's 'still busy. So he
puts his hand in the body, really rummages around, finds the sweet, takes it
out, and then realises he's in fact got the bullet between his fingers.
..Guiltily, he slips it back into the body, rummages a bit more, finds the
sweet, wipes it, & pops it in his mouth. At which second the X-ray arrives.

                                   ASSISTANT
              Here we go, doctor. ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is here -
              so we'll probably have to extend the cut to here. Think we all
              better be prepared for a long one here. This is tricky.

BEAN tuts scornfully - 'you're wrong 1, reaches in again, feels around for a
second, and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers.

They all applaud.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.    CORRIDOR - DAY.

BEAN exits from the theatre - still in gown and mask, followed by the
assistant. The police SIDE-KICK is waiting.

                                   SIDE-KICK
             Any news on the chief?.

                                                                                101

                                    ASSISTANT
            There certainly is.    Dr Bean here just saved his life.

SIDE-KICK's eyes water. He's choked. BEAN shakes his hand nervously, and
heads on fast before he's found out. He turns the corner and suddenly sees
DAVID and ALISON, still seated. ALISON sees him.

                          ALISON
            0 my god.

                                    DAVID
             Sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.

                                    ALISON
            Nothing ever really changes, does it, David?

She turns her head away: the bond of the moments before is gone.       BEAN looks
very contrite. At that moment, another doctor walks by.

                                      DAVID
            Excuse me.

                                   DOCTOR 2
            Yes, your doctor will be with you in a minute.    We have a lot to
            deal with here, sir.

ALISON looks round, and shakes her head. BEAN kicks DAVID in the shins.
DAVID looks round, puzzled. There is a poster of the human skeleton. BEAN
points to the spine. DAVID looks but cannot fathom a relevant meaning from
it.

Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first.       He's
young, confident slightly arrogant.

                                     ALISON
            Excuse me, doctor.

                                    DOCTOR
            Really Ma'am, we'll get to you in due course.

                                     ALISON
            Okay.

DAVID looks at the poster opposite again. Spine, ribcage, skull. Looks back
at Bean gesturing to it. This time the penny drops! Spine spineless!

                                                                                102

                                      DAVID
            Say that again, son.

                                     DOCTOR
            I beg your pardon?

                                    DAVID
            I said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I'll
            make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less
            healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.

                                       DOCTOR
               I'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.

                                       DAVID
               We have. In fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the
               Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end
               of the world.

A hint of a smile arrives on ALISON's lips. She's heard that somewhere before.

                                                DAVID
               So,    why not haul    your    ... (checks) nice little ass into this room
               and    explain to me    and    my wife why our precious daughter is going
               to    be absolutely    fine    because of all the fantastic intelligence
               and    attention you    are    going to give her case.

                                               DOCTOR
               Okay, sir.        Certainly.    Good.

DAVID turns to ALISON - she does a little tilt of her
Head `WOW'. And he turns to BEAN, who points to
himself,    and nods .... n Come on!

                                       DAVID
               Yes, and Bean, for God's sake, keep out of the goddamn way, will
               you?

 BEAN nods enthusiastically and backs off.

                                               ALISON
                 Smiling         Well, well.

                                                                                  CUT TO:

INT.     HOSPITAL.    JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Close on an E.C.G. monitor, green lines on black screen. DAVID and ALISON sit
by JENNIFER's bed. JENNIFER is unconscious. She has her arm in a cast and a
small Band-Aid on her head. otherwise she seems undamaged.

KEVIN    is sitting on the end of the bed playing the SUPER NINTENDO game (the
Gothic    Vampire thing, with bats and he-men, we saw on JENNIFER'S TV earlier).
It is    plugged into a T.V. which sits on a trolley. It's quite a noisy game.
KEVIN    is immersed in it.

                                               ALISON
               Let's get a coffee.

                                             DAVID
               Yes.     Great.     Kevin, I'11 send Bean in to keep you company.

ALISON exits. David follows. BEAN enters.               He sees JENNIFER for the first
time. Sympathy shows in his eyes.

                                       KEVIN
               Help me with this. It's a scientific experiment. We're gonna
               wake up Sleeping Beauty here with the tortured screams of Vampire
               bats.

BEAN is determined to help. He sits down with KEVIN. The game continues.
The he-man jumps up and down, lashing out at bats with his sword. Lots of
noise, but JENNIFER sleeps on.

                                                                          CUT TO:

                                       ALISON
             Disgusting.

She looks up at DAVID, who's looking at her.     Slowly she gets close and puts
her arms around him. She's a bit tearful.

                                     DAVID
             Everything's gonna be fine.

              It was nothing. We're not ... He just makes me laugh.      When was
              the last time we laughed? Any of us?

                                     DAVID
              I know... I know. I've been an arsehole of spectacular
              proportions. Olympic standard.

                                        KEVIN
              Dad...

 They look down to see KEVIN has arrived.

                                     KEVIN
              These guys just hijacked the T.V. Me and Bean were trying to ...

 A hospital PORTER passes, pushing the T.V. on a trolley.

                                HOSPITAL PORTER
              Sorry, folks. We're short on these and there's another kid down

INT.   HOSPITAL.   JENNIFER'S ROOM - NIGHT

JENNIFER is still asleep. BEAN is sitting on the end of her bed. He looks at
the SUPER NINTENDO console thinking, "How can I get this working again? How
can I help?" The only sound in the room is the beeping from the E.C.G.
machine, monitoring Jennifer's heart. BEAN has an idea.

He yanks off the jack plug at the end of the Super Nintendo lead.        Producing
his small screwdriver, he starts to unscrew the console casing.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     CORRIDOR - NIGHT

DAVID, ALISON and KEVIN walk back towards the room.

                                     ALISON
             Maybe I ought to think about getting another job.

                                     DAVID
             Good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.

She and DAVID manage to share a smile. They're going to get through this.
Suddenly, we hear noise from the vampire game, coming from JENNIFER's room.
KEVIN registers this and is puzzled. Then ALISON and DAVID notice it.

                                         DAVID
             I thought you said....
                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   HOSPITAL.     JENNIFER'S ROOM - DAY

The LEARYS appear in the open doorway.       Their expressions turn from curiosity
to horror.

BEAN has plugged the SUPER NINTENDO games system into the       back of JENNIFER's
E.C.G. monitor. A couple of bats are flapping about the        screen but the most
worrying thing here (shown in close-up) is the sight of a       he-man type, jumping
up and down, lashing out, with his sword, at the passing       pulse light, showing
Jennifer's faint vital signs ...

ALISON gasps.      DAVID slowly moves into the room.

                                     DAVID
             Now, Bean ... just put down that thing ... nice and slow ... you
             hear me? Come on now...

But BEAN is determined to keep going - it's his way of reviving Jennifer.
DAVID approaches the opposite side of the bed and gets ready to pounce ... CUT
TO: a close-up of the monitor. The he-man chases the pulse light ...

DAVID dives across the bed just as he man swipes the pulse light with his
sword. DAVID has landed on top of JENNIFER. The pulse light explodes and the
monitor screen whites-out. JENNIFER wakes up with a start.

                                                                                   106

                                        JENNIFER
             Dad!     Get off!?   What's happening here?!   Mom?

ALISON covers her mouth, tearful, but she can't hold it back.        She laughs.

DAVID and KEVIN stare at JENNIFER. They can't help but join in the laughter.
JENNIFER has no idea what's going on. BEAN is happy that everyone is happy.

                                     KEVIN
             I don't care what anyone says. Mr. Bean brought my sister back
             from the dead. He did it under laboratory conditions. My eyes do
             not lie!

ALISON grins at him.      Then at BEAN.

                                                        MIX THROUGH TO:

INT.   LEARY HOUSE.     KITCHEN.   NIGHT.

ALISON is fixing some coffee.       DAVID enters.

                                            DAVID
             Here, let me do that.

                                          ALISON
             No, I'm fine.

He just stands there.

             okay - you grind the beans, and


He moves towards her - his arms slip round her waist.

             ... put them in the .... ( but she can't concentrate I don't
             believe this. I'm being seduced by my own husband.

Pause. They are just about to kiss when BEAN enters.
He's a bit impatient.

                                      BEAN
             Ahm - excuse me ... ( POINTING TO HIS WATCH ) You know..

They jump apart.      The moment is gone.

                                          ALISON
             Oh yes.     Sorry.    Though I think these are ready.

                                                                                  107


ALISON takes out two single socks which have been neatly wrapped around a
couple of drinks mats and put in the toaster slots.

                                        ALISON
             There.     Is that how you like them?

BEAN beams at her.      He's impressed - and feels he's accepted.    He leaves.

                                          ALISON
             He's not too bad.       I can live with him.

                                     DAVID
             I'm afraid you don't know the half of it. Sit down.       I have a tale
             to tell. And not a happy one.

                                                                            CUT TO:

EXT.   THE LEARY'S KITCHEN.     NIGHT

Looking in front outside, we see Alison sit down. We see, ,but do not hear
David start to talk. Within seconds her hands go up to her face in horror.

                                                                            CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.     DAY.

With heavy hearts everyone is gathered to hear their fate. Pan across the
familiar faces. DAVID. BERNIE. ELMER. ANNIE. BEAN, looking nervous and
shifty. Dead silence as GRIERSON stands, very solemnly.

                                    GRIERSON
             Colleagues - what can I say? Incidents such as occurred yesterday
             teach a man important lessons. On reflection, I realise it would
             have been a sin to sell Whistler's Mother to such an impertinent
             philistine as Governor Reynolds. And therefore, I blame myself
             for having ever let things get to such a pass that we felt we had
             realise our the staff - twelve got today, I've Schimmel as to sell
             her. I suddenly problem here hasn't been it's been the leadership
             flabby, lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new Vice-
             President.


CUT TO BERNIE, looking smug next to DAVID, who is pretty shocked by this.

                                                                                108

                                    GRIERSON
               He's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and
               the 21st century.

                                          BERNIE
               Thank you, sir.       Although, I'm afraid I don't quite see how we
               can ...

                                    GRIERSON
               Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
               interjection I'd expect from my new V.P. How can we, you ask,
               survive without Whistler's Mother - our single greatest asset?
               Well, the truth is - we can't. So what am I saying? Will we
               find her again? Never - this robber was clearly the work of a
               criminal of great genius.

BEAN looks pleased - but then realises it's not a suitable emotion ~ so nods
sagely.

               Insurance? Not a chance. Those bastards never pay. So,
               surely we're bankrupt? Surely your jobs are forfeit? Surely
               you're back on the unemployment lines, scraping a living as
               waiters and boys? Yes. Yes indeed. Except for one little
               thing. one little thing done by one little man. Dare I say,
               one helluva little man. Watch this.

Everyone is totally at a     loss. GRIERSON stands and moves to the framed poster
of Whistler's Mother on     the wall. He then produces a plastic key card and
inserts it in a slot on     the side of the frame. A buzz and a click! An
electric motor starts to     whirrrr ...

The glass, along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster, slides
gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in fact the
original oil of Whistler's Mother.

                                    GRIERSON
               Ladies and gentlemen. The REAL Whistler's Mother!

There are gasps from the room.     BEAN is open mouthed.

GRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively.      He's
saved!

                              GRIERSON
                The best security in the world is no match for a master
                criminal. But no master criminal is a match for me. Thank
                you all. Now if you would please return to your posts, my new
                Vice President, Bernard Shimmel would like you all to see the
                computer program we had prepared for yesterday until we were
                so rudely interrupted by events.

The room is emptying.     DAVID and BEAN stand there, DAVID stunned.   GRIERSON
heads over.

                                    GRIERSON
             David, David, David ...

                                       DAVID
             I'm fired?    Because I let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?

                                    GRIERSON
               Of course not. I'm sacking you for neglectful conduct,
               relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred,
               through your recent lack of professional judgement. A loss I
               trust Bernie will be able to reverse.

                                       David
              But ....

                                    GRIERSON
               I will of course invite you an excellent reference - or Bernie
               will.

BERNIE looks across from the computer and smiles.      BEAN has his eyes on DAVID.
He is mortified by what's

happening.   GRIERSON notices but misinterprets his worried expression.


                                    GRIERSON
               Of course, Dr. Bean, we'll arrange alternative accommodation
               for you. I believe Bernie has a spare room with en suite
               bathroom.

DAVID glares at BERNIE.     BEAN is thinking 'No!   I don't want to stay with
horrible BERNIE.'

                                    GRIERSON
             How are you making out there?

                                                                                110

                                      BERNIE
             All fixed up, sir.   Stick around, Davey boy.   This is going to be
             quite a show.

He presses an intercom.    He's enjoying himself.

             Hi everyone - this is your new Vice President, Bernie Shistler.
             Would you please watch your video screens. You're in for a treat,
             guys.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   VARIOUS ROOMS.   DAY.

All the staff in all the rooms, gallery, canteen, corridors, look up at
various screens. Cut round rooms during this flashy demonstration.

                                     BERNIE
                                      (V/0)
             Here you can see our new interactive gallery guide.    Every picture
             in the gallery will have its own story to tell.

A Van Gogh picture comes up on the giant video screens

....and then keeps changing, as BERNIE keeps talking.

             Just click , and here is a portrait of the painter - then his
             family then other paintings by him - then other pictures relevant
             to him in the gallery

 Everyone is delighted and impressed.

             And the beauty is, any idiot can use it. Dr Bean - would you like
             a try?

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE - DAY.

BEAN swiftly obliges and sits at the computer.

                                     BERNIE
             Perhaps you'd like to bring up Whistler's Mother.

 But BEAN has another plan.    He begins to click boxes.

                                                                         CUT TO:

INT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY.   MAIN GALLERY - DAY.

The Millais painting we have seen before, with the padlock, comes up on the
video screen.

                                    BERNIE
                                     (V/0)
                 Ah, Our visiting professor has chosen the splendid Millais
                 painting - "His Mistress"

                                                                       CUT BACK:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE.     DAY.

BEAN busy on the computer.

                                     BERNIE
               Just click on the corner.

BEAN again disobeys ... He clicks on the padlock repeatedly - humming the
familiar 'Goblins' tune. BERNIE is looking very tense.

                                     BERNIE
               Right let me take over now...

BEAN turns and snarls at him - almost a bark ...

                                                                             CUT TO:
INT.   THE MAIN GALLERY - DAY

Everyone is glued to the screens.

                                     BERNIE
              You've had long enough on it now.       A joke's a joke.   That's it.
              Period!

On the computer screens, the screen has gone black, just as it did when Bean
was playing earlier, and the 6 dashes have appeared with the flashing cursor
over the first of them. All watch, intrigued by what they see.

                                                                             CUT TO:

INT.   GRIERSON'S OFFICE DAY

The blood drains from BERNIE's face.        Still humming happily, BEAN slowly types
in the letters:

                                     P-E-R-I-0-D

                                     BERNIE
             You can stop right there, Mr! Those are confidential ...

                                                                                 112


Words and figures fill the screen.        BEAN throws his hands up and sings a
verbal fanfare:

                                          BEAN
             Daaa!   Daaa!

GRIERSON moves to DAVID's side and the two stare at the screen, the meaning of
its contents dawning on them. Close up of the screen as their eyes find the
words: `NEW ARTIST EXHIBIT' in the middle of columns of words, figures and
dollar signs.

                                                                             CUT TO:
INT.   GRIERSON GALLERY.     ALL ROOMS.

The same figures are being flashed all over on the huge screens. People
watching and listening in awe. ANNIE and ELMER stare at it angrily.

                                                                           CUT TO:

                                     BERNIE
             Excuse me, If I may just ...

                                    GRIERSON
                                    (calmly)
             Shut up, Schimmel. Exactly how long have you been siphoning
             gallery money into your own private accounts?

DAVID scrolls down the screen.

                                     DAVID
             Look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all
             completely fictional ... back as far as June 93 ...

                                     BERNIE
             I don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...

                                     GRIERSON
             Horse shit.   You're dead, grease-ball.   Period.

He pushes a button, that sends a picture of what's happening in his office
throughout the Gallery.

             My friends, good news. Mr Schimmel is not only no longer Vice-
             President. He actually no longer works here.

                                     BERNIE
              But wait a minute - you can't let some moron from England turn
              you against me. I deny any knowledge of this. He probably
              typed in all this stuff himself. Don't you find it all a bit
              suspicious that it's here at his fingertips. (pointing at Bean)
              There's your criminal, gentlemen. There's the Limey that set me
              up!

Pause. All eyes turn to BEAN.     CUT TO people watching the big screens
everywhere.

                                      GRIERSON
              Dr. Bean.    Have you got anything to say to that?

 BEAN looks long and hard at BERNIE.

                                      BEAN
              Yes- (PAUSE) It's exceedingly rude to point.

And punches BERNIE sharply in the nose.    Everyone in the gallery bursts into
applause.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.   THE GRIERSON GALLERY - DAY.

Half an hour later. Police cars draw up.      BERNIE is shoved in the back seat
of one. GRIERSON, BEAN & DAVID watch.

                                    GRIERSON
                               (to uniformed cop)
              I don't know what your methods are these days, Officer, but I'd

             also ask him a few questions about the destruction of the
             Whistler copy.

BEAN nods his head firmly.    The car pulls away.     Then breaks and reverses.
The SIDE-KICK gets out.

                                     SIDE~KICK
            Oh, yeah - I forgot.

SIDE-KICK opens the back of the car.    He takes out a huge bunch of flowers.

             The chief said I was to give you these.

BEAN is delighted. Then sniffs the flowers.      What a nasty stink.    Not his
sort of thing at all.

                                                                                  114


SIDE-KICK drives AWAY.   GRIERSON turns to DAVID.

                                   GRIERSON
            I owe you a very serious apology, young man. It wouldn't surprise
            me if you wanted to leave us after this. I sincerely hope that
            you do not.

                                    DAVID
            VERY ACCOMMODATING Well, no, sir, I'm sure ...

He looks sideways to Bean, who is frantically pointing to his spine.       DAVID
gets the message, and changes his tune..

            Let me think about that, Thomas.     We'd have to talk quite a salary
            hike.

                                     GRIERSON
            Of course.

                                       DAVID
            And a car.

                                     GRIERSON
            Mmmmm...


                                       DAVID
            Maybe two cars.

                                     GRIERSON
            A car sounds sensible.

                                    DAVID
            And I need Fridays off, to spend more time with my family.
            Speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... I've got a lot of
            time to make up.

DAVID heads off. BEAN wants to follow, but needs to get rid of the stinky
flowers. He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them. She
beams with delight: after all, he DID love her.

BEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot.       As they go, DAVID puts an arm

round BEAN.

Who shoos him away instantly.           No sloppiness for him.

                                                                                CUT TO:


                                                                                      115

EXT.   THE LEARY HOUSE.          HALL - DAY.

The LEARY family in a group.           JENNIFER's arm in a sling.

                                       ALISON
                well, it's been... unusual. But thank you.

She goes to kiss BEAN - but he just sticks out his hand, and shakes it firmly.
Then moves on to JENNIFER.

                                            JENNIFER
                Good-bye Mr Bean.        Sorry I screamed that first time.

 He shakes her broken arm firmly ... and she screams again.

                                             DAVID
                Come on          hurry or we'll be late.

                                                                                CUT TO:

EXT.   LEARY HOUSE.       DAY.

BEAN, KEVIN    & DAVID    get into the car. It pulls away, as they drive off, BEAN
sticks his    hand of    the window - and waves a last farewell to ALISON and
JENNIFER.     At last    a sentimental moment - romantic music swelling - like Liza
Minelli at    the end    of "Cabaret".

Until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the
car squeezes past.

                                                           MIX THROUGH TO:

INT.   AMERICAN AIRPORT.          DEPARTURE AREA - DAY

The three 30 year old women, dressed in curly red wigs from the musical,
'Annie', hug and kiss their little BALD MAN and send him off through the
gates. They shriek and wave him good-bye. DAVID, KEVIN and BEAN are there.

                                       DAVID
               ... Oh, and Grierson phoned Lord Walton at the National. Said
               good things about you. So expect a great reception back home,
               huh?

BEAN delighted. Promotion is in his sights. He studies his watch.              He's
being polite but held really like to get going.

                                                                                      116

                                       KEVIN
               Good-bye Beanie. It's Bean .... surreal.          And don't forget you're
               welcome to come back anytime ...

   DAVID delivers a sharp nudge to his ribs.

                                      KEVIN
              ... in the distant future.

                                      DAVID
              Bye, Bean. Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?      I know
              it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.

BEAN    nods abruptly, picks up his case, checks his watch and goes. He doesn't
look    back. Kevin and David turn and walk away. DAVID does stop to look back
over    his shoulder at BEAN, heading off in the distance. But BEAN doesn't
turn,    so DAVID walks on.

Then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder. It's BEAN, ,as though he's
magically jumped there. He gives DAVID a big bear hug, a big grin, and then a
little wave - and heads away. In the distance, he treads on the back of ,some
one's shoe.

                                                       MIX THROUGH TO:

EXT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY.   LONDON - DAY

Shot from high up. BEAN's lime green mini approaches, coming around Trafalgar
Square, and drives up onto the pavement, in front of the gallery. It stops
and BEAN gets out. He looks up at the building, pleased to be back.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN pauses outside the revolving doors to clip his staff identity badge onto
his top pocket. He enters in high spirits.

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.    THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN enters the reception hall. It is totally deserted.
He frowns, and heads on, puzzled..

                                                                                  117

                                                                           CUT TO:

INT.    NATIONAL GALLERY.   GALLERY 1    DAY

The place    is totally empty except for a CLEANER sweeping up litter in the
middle of    the room. There are faded rectangles on the walls where all the
paintings    should be. Only one very solid looking statue remains. BEAN is
thoroughly    perplexed

                                        CLEANER
              They've moved, guy.


BEAN is utterly perplexed. He looks round the corner into another empty
gallery, and shakes his head.

                                                                           CUT TO:

EXT.   THE NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN looks up at the building and gives a disgusted grunt ,before getting into
his car and drives off around Trafalgar Square. His brow is deeply furrowed.
What will he do now with his life?

                                                                         CUT TO:
INT.   THE NATIONAL GALLERY ~ DAY

The empty gallery BEAN just inspected. Then, from out behind the one
remaining statue, emerges MISS HUTCHINSON. Then, from behind a pillar, LORD
WALTON.

                          LORD WALTON
               Is he gone?

                          MISS HUTCHINSON
               Yes, my lord.

                           LORD WALTON
               Tell the others.

                           MISS HUTCHINSON
               Very well, my lord.

                                                                         CUT TO:


INT.   PITCH DARK ROOM.       DAY.

Pitch dark. A door opens and the light from the corridor falls on the 150
gallery employees squashed into this one tiny room. It's the gent's loo.

                                                                              118

MISS HUTCHINSON's head pops in.

                                  MISS HUTCHINSON
                   He's gone.

Massive cheer, bowlers in the air, massive music.     Roll credits.

                                                                         CUT TO:

EXT.   BEAN'S HOUSE        DAY.

Behind the credits, we see close-ups of BEAN hammering away at large planks of
wood on some wooden structure.

He walks    away from it - without us seeing what it is
and goes    to his Mini, where TEDDY sits on a pile of books in the front seat,
wearing a    seat belt. Bean gets into the car, which is laden with suitcases,
starts it    up and drives ....

.... straight into the huge crate he has built.     A rope tied to the back
bumper pulls the lid closed behind him.

                                                                         CUT TO:

EXT.   MOTORWAY.    DAY.

The crate sits on the back of a speeding truck.
                                                                       CUT TO:

EXT.   AIRPORT.   DAY.

The crate is now on the top of a forklift truck moving up the ramp on an
American airline cargo plane. Close up on a large sticker on the crate: it
reads: "DAVID LEARY, 23 WOODFORD AVENUE, CHESTERFIELD, CALIFORNIA. HANDLE
WITH CARE.


And cut to the plane flying through clear skies.   Though, for the Lear's of
course there are no clear skies ahead.

Beavis and Butt-Head Do America - by Mike Judge and Joe Stillman

 

 

	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	"BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD DO AMERICA"
	
	by
	
	Mike Judge and Joe Stillman
	
	
	
	
		The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
	and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
	what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
	debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
	coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
	like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
	footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
	intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
	SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
	up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
	shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
	huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
	Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
	buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
		Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
	He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
	swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
	stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
	reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
	lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
	his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
	screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
	lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
	huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
	"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
	We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
	giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
	around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
	BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
	destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
	Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
	puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
	the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
		We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking 
	Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking 
	him.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
	
	
					BEAVIS (O.C.)
			Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
	
	Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
	
					BEAVIS
			Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
	
	Butt-Head comes around.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
			Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What's gone?
	
					BEAVIS
			The TV.
	
	Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
	
	Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV 
	was.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
	
	Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their 
	van.
	
	Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We 
	see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
	
	Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN 
	DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
	a couple of times - piecing it all together.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Whoa! I think I just figured something
			out Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS
			What?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh.
	
	Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where 
	the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
	
	Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on 
	the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks more than anything that
			has ever sucked before. We must find
			this butt-hole that took the TV.
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
	
	Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
	
	A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in 
	fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, 
	chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes 
	off his glasses.
	
	FREEZE ON BEAVIS
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Beavis!
	
	FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
	
					BEAVIS
			Freeze, butt-wipe!
	
	An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses 
	a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
	
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a 
	waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, 
	collar way open. He plops down in the bed.
	
	FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Butt-Head!
	
	FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Star in...
	
	
	MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
	
	ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
	
	OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits 
	would.
	
	Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
	
	Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
	
	Beavis drives, chasing a car.
	
	Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
	
	A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.
	
	B&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
	
	In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
	
	Butt-Head does the same.
	
	Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
	
	A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. 
	FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into 
	bed. Suddenly...
	
	
	INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
	
	From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
	
	B&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables 
	attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push 
	the cart we hear more equipment falling.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit, it's stuck.
	
	They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that 
	the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which 
	all come crashing to the ground.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this
			thing back to the house.
	
	
	INT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
	
	MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on
			here?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, someone stole our TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.
			Get outta the way. Heh heh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
			Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
			experience for you guys. There's a
			wonderful world out there when we discover
			we don't need TV to entertain us.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
	
					BEAVIS
					(to himself)
			Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh 
			heh. Anus. Heh heh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
					(frustrated)
			Have you guys heard a word I've said?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			Look, guys, just take the TV back to the
			A.V. room right now. And try to be a little
			more open-minded. Mmkay?
	
	Van Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What a dork. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
	
	
	EXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
	
	B&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely 
	attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy 
	and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			No it wasn't!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh,...Oh yeah.
	
	B&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. 
	PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
	
					McVICKER
			Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...
			get out! You're suspended. One more
			screw up... and you're expelled.
	
	B&B walk off laughing.
	
	
	EXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
	
	B&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
			know Anderson had a Camper.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
			Heh heh. TV.
	
	B&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY 
	ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
	
					MARCY
			Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
			at the refrigerator?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, no.
	
					BEAVIS
			We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
	
					MARCY
			Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
			Come on in.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
	B&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
	
	
	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
	
	Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
	
					TOM
			Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
			the most important thing you can have
			on a camper is a good propane regulator,
			and this here's the best one they make.
	
					MARCY
			I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
			before we leave.
	
					TOM
			Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
			our whole lives and we're gonna go come
			Hell or high water...
	
	Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B 
	AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
	
					TOM (CONT.)
			What the hell is that noise?
	
	
	INT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
	
	B&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the 
	refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the 
	counter on which the TV is sitting.
	
	Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL 
	OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
	
	ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the 
	TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV 
	goes dead.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
	
	
	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
	
	B&B come out. Tom notices them.		
	
					TOM
			Hey, what's goin' on here?
	
					MARCY
			They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
	
					TOM
			The TV ain't broken.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
	
	Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.
	
	TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.
	
					TOM
			Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
			familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
			been whackin' off in my tool shed?
	
					BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back 
	and forth.
	
	B&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
	
	
	EXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
	
	B&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has 
	the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight 
	Cowboy."
	
					BEAVIS
			Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What's your problem Beavis?
	
					BEAVIS
			I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
	
	Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a 
	golden, throbbing light.
	
	BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". 
	Pull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, 
	featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap 
	Rates."
	
	B&B stare up, as if at a god.
	
					BEAVIS
					(crazed)
			Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
	
	
	EXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
	
	Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second 
	door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
	
	B&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the 
	legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS 
	him.
	
					McVICKER
			Please mmm... may I have another?!
	
	B&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
	
					McVICKER (CONT.)
			Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
			bastards.
	
					BEAVIS
			Can we watch your TV?
	
					McVICKER
			Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
	
	Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards 
	the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed 
	by McVicker asking for another.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
			everything!
	
	
	INT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
	
	The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, 
	talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck 
	- a Jack Ruby type.
	
	On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of 
	bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
	
					MUDDY
			...Are you sure these guys can pull this
			off? It's gotta look like an accident...
	
	We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.
	
					MUDDY (CONT.)
			Hold on a minute. That must be them now.
			I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
			Come in!
	
	B&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
	
					BEAVIS
					(sounding suddenly sedated)
			Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Yer late.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
	
	MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&B are a drunken blur.
	
					MUDDY
			Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
			jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get
			the job done. So what are your names?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, Butt-Head.
	
					BEAVIS
			Beavis.
	
					MUDDY
			That's alright. I'd rather not know your
			real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm
			gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you
			ten grand plus expenses, all payable after
			you do her...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(full of innuendo)
			Do her? Huh huh.
	
					MUDDY
			That's right. I'm offering you ten grand
			plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
	
	Butt-Head stares in shock.
	
					BEAVIS
			Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your
			wife.
	
					BEAVIS
					(trembling)
			Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
	
	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us
			to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay
			us. We can buy a new TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to Muddy)
			Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
	
					MUDDY
			Okay, then let's get down to business.
	
	ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. 
	Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
	
					MUDDY (CONT.)
			Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
			as sweet as she looks. She stole everything
			from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll
			do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
	
	Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.
	
					MUDDY
			She's holed up in a hotel room in Las
			Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of
			hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the
			airport.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
	
					BEAVIS
			Can we watch some TV first?
	
	Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.
	
					MUDDY
			No.
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREETS - MORNING
	
	Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with 
	bloodshot eyes. B&B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the 
	rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a 
	SHRIEK.
	
					MUDDY
			One more thing. Mah wife's got this
			leather satchel. It's black, about this
			big. I need ya to bring it back. It's
			real important. Sentimental value... Any
			questions so far?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
	
					MUDDY
			She sure does.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
	
					MUDDY
			Just make sure it looks like an 
			accident...
	
					BEAVIS
					(spastic)
			Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
			accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have
			a drink on it.
	
	Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
	
	
	EXT.  AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
	
	In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, 
	fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels 
	away.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			We're gonna get paid to score.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna
			get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, this is the greatest day of
			our lives. Huh huh huh.
	
	
	INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY
	
	B&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the 
	right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches 
	them.
	
					DOLORIS
			Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
	
					DOLORIS
			I think your tickets have you seated
			in row fourteen, coach. So why don't
			you just go ahead and move back, OK?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			That's OK. Someone else can have those.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, it's not that important to me,
			really. Those seats are too small anyways.
	
	Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the 
	aisle.
	
	ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly 
	woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
	
					DOLORIS
			Here you are.
	
	She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, 
	Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
			here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh
			huh huh.
	
	Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.
	
					MARTHA
			Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
			Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, we're gonna score.
	
					MARTHA
			I hope to score big there myself. I'm
			mostly going to be doing the slots.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. 
			Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in
			Las Vegas?
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, there are so many slots you won't
			know where to begin.
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick
			is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be
			tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
					MARTHA
			It's so nice to meet young men who are so
			well mannered.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a
			big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, that's nice.
	
					CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
					(through P.A.)
			Good morning. This is your captain
			speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151
			non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you
			turn your attention to the front of the
			cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.
	
	B&B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.
	
					ATTENDANT'S VOICE
			To fasten your seat belt, insert the free
			end into the coupling.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Insert. Huh huh huh.
	
	Doloris demonstrates. B&B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Uh...
	
	They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's 
	parts.
	
					TAMMY (O.C.)
			Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
	
	Butt-Head looks up.
	
	From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her 
	hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.
	
	CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull 
	one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.
	
	Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud 
	CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
	
					TAMMY (CONT.)
			There you go. You're all set.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(stunned)
			I love you.
	
	Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.
	
					BEAVIS
			Wait, I wanted her to do it.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
	
					CAPTAIN'S VOICE
			Flight attendants, please prepare for
			take-off.
	
	The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.
	
	Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything 
	but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.
	
	The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to 
	freak.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
	
	Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window 
	and realizes they're in the air.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
					(screams)
			Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&B:
	
					MAN
			D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!
	
					WOMAN
			Oh my God!!!!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting 
	up.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
	
					BEAVIS
			Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all
			gonna die!
	
	The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the 
	plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down 
	the aisle.
	
	ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
	
	In free fall:
	
	Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes 
	tearing out.
	
	Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which 
	open and spill their contents.
	
	Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and 
	coffee to pour freely.
	
	ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their 
	screaming.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's 
	directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is 
	strapped in.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that
			thing with my belt again?
	
	
	INT.  PLANE - LATER
	
	All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the 
	aisle. People read, relaxed.
	
	ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her 
	grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy 
	gave him.
	
					BEAVIS
			I'm probably going to make out with her
			first before we, you know, get down...
	
					MARTHA
			You'll have to speak up son. I have this
			ringing in my ears. My doctor says it
			could be related to my heart
			palpitations. I've had two operations on
			my heart.
	
					BEAVIS
			Really? I poop too much.
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then
			I get tired.
	
					MARTHA
			Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
			take a couple of these.
	
	She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
	
					MARTHA (CONT.)
			They perk me right up.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh, thanks.
	
	He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy. 
	Then his eyes open wide.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
					(strange)
			Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
	
	Beavis starts wolfing them down.
	
	
	INT.  PLANE - A BIT LATER
	
	Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with 
	Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to Tammy)
			So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
			Vegas? Huh huh huh.
	
	Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.
	
	ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.
	
	PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The 
	guy's asleep.
	
	Butt-head picks up the beer.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. 
	Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, 
	etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)
	
	Tammy reaches her next passenger.
	
					TAMMY
			Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections
			tonight are chicken piccata or seafood
			gumbo...
	
					BEAVIS (O.S.)
			Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
	
	Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the 
	background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of 
	Cornholio mode.
	
					PASSENGER
			Does the gumbo have corn in it?
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his 
	head in full Cornholio mode.
	
					BEAVIS
			I am Cornholio! I need picatta for
			my bunghole!
	
					TAMMY
			You'll have to wait your turn sir.
	
					BEAVIS
			Are you threatening me? My bunghole
			will not wait!
	
	Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.
	
	ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the 
	other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being 
	pressed.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
	
	ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.
	
	The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit 
	slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
	
					BEAVIS
			Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
	
	The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee 
	to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain 
	then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A 
	NOSE-DIVE.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD
	
	In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take 
	a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go 
	FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
	
	Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in 
	the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off, 
	and he continues to fly forward.
	
	COCKPIT
	
	The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.
	
	Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel 
	facing the captain.
	
					CAPTAIN
			Get the hell out of the cockpit!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh, you said...
	
					CAPTAIN
			NOW!!!
	
	The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane 
	out of the dive.
	
	
	EXT.  LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
	
	The plane lands.
	
	
	INT.  COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING
	
	The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people 
	deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with 
	flecks of spilled food and other matter.
	
					ATTENDANTS
			Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
	
	They grow silent and still as B&B pass by. Beavis takes the T-
	shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	
	INT.  TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY
	
	Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two 
	businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their 
	names. A reunited couple hugs.
	
	B&B look around in confusion.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be
			casinos and lights and stuff.
	
	People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.
	
	One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a 
	sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.
	
	B&B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding
			a sign?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check
			this out.
	
	B&B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and 
	hangs a "B.A." at the guy.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					DRIVER
			Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where
			I can find these guys, would ya?
	
	He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his 
	pants. They look and try to read:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(reads)
			Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
	
					BEAVIS
					(reads)
			Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(realizes)
			Huh huh. This says Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS
			And Boot-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,
			Beavis. These dudes have the same name as
			us.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, we should party.
	
	The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.
	
					DRIVER
			This way, sirs.
	
	B&B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.
	
					BEAVIS
			So where's those guys?
	
	
	EXT.  MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B's 
	TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the 
	door.
	
					ROSS
			Where the hell is he?
	
					HARLAN
			You sure this is the right place?
	
	Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No 
	one's there.
	
	Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next 
	to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
	
					HARLAN (CONT.)
			You Muddy?
	
					MUDDY
					(slurring)
			You the cops?
	
					ROSS
			Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take
			care of your wife...
	
	Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
	
					MUDDY
			What the hell?!... What about those other...
	
					ROSS
			Huh?
	
	Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-
	four.
	
					MUDDY
			Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
	
					HARLAN
			Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You
			wanna buy a new one?
	
	Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
	
					MUDDY
			I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all
			three a' them!
	
	Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.
	
	Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF 
	THE VAN. This causes B&B's TV and some other loot to spill out the 
	back onto the sidewalk.
	
	Ross starts to pick it up.
	
					HARLAN
			Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.
	
					ROSS
			Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin'
			from rich people.
	
	
	EXT.  LAS VEGAS - DAY
	
	MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.
	
		Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot 
		Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las 
		Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do 
		With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like 
		"Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's 
		"You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.
	
	The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling 
	up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
	
	Establishing shots. Excitement. Gambling tables going on forever.
	
	ON THE LOUNGE BAND playing the song we've been hearing. They 
	should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song.
	
	PAN DOWN rows of slot machines.
	
	PAN ACROSS DEALERS handling cards and chips.
	
	DOLLY RIGHT UP TO B&B, staring in utter awe.
	
	REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a 
	bare-chested woman.
	
	Their faces are blank. They're seeing God. Finally:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis. This is what it's all about.
	
					BEAVIS
					(speechless)
			Heh heh. Yeah.

	INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door is opened by a bellboy.

	Beavis rushes in and grabs the remote which is attached to the 
	night table. He tries to pull it up and can't.
	
					BEAVIS
			This remote's too heavy!
	
					BELLBOY
			Sir, it's attached to the...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Here, dumbass! Let me try!
	
	They both struggle to pull it up. Finally, they fall over 
	backwards.
	
	Annoyed, the bellboy leaves.
	
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR BANK/9TH FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	The elevator arrives. B&B get on. There's several sophisticated 
	people. From inside, a computerized FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE:
	
					ELEVATOR VOICE
			Ninth floor, going down.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Going down. Huh huh huh.
	
	The sophisticated people look repulsed. The doors close.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
	
	MUSIC DIPS DOWN FOR DIALOGUE. B&B step off the elevator and walk 
	among the gambling tables.
	
	Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites 
	into it.
	
					BEAVIS
			Ow! These chips suck.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find
			that chick.
	
	Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table.
	
	ANGLE ON THE WHEEL. The ball lands on 13.
	
	At the table, the DEALER...
	
					DEALER
			13. We have a winner. (to Beavis) Sir,
			your chips?
	
					BEAVIS
			I don't want 'em! Keep 'em.
	
					DEALER
			Let it ride!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to dealer)
			Uh... could you help us find a chick?
	
					DEALER
					(uneasy)
			Sir, the casino does not partake in that

	The wheel stops.
	
					DEALER (CONT.)
					(amazed)
			13! Winner!
	
	People oooh and aaah. More gather to watch.
	
	Through the gathering throng comes CHERYL, a hooker.
	
					CHERYL
			Excuse me, boys. Did I hear you say 
			you're looking for a date?
	
	B&B freeze, shocked.
	
					CHERYL (CONT.)
			I'm Cheryl, and I can show you a real
			fine time.
	
	B&B don't move. The dealer rolls again.
	
					CHERYL (CONT.)
			A time you'll remember for the rest of
			your lives, if you know what I mean.
	
					DEALER
					(to Beavis)
			Sir, do you want your chips?
	
					BEAVIS
			No, Dammit! I don't want any chips!
	
					DEALER
			Let it ride.
	
	Cheryl puts her hands on their thighs.
	
					CHERYL
			What say we three go up to your room,

	B&B's eyes open wide.

			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... Uh...
	
	The wheel stops.
	
					DEALER
			14. No winners.
	
					CHERYL
			Hmmmm. Oh well.
	
	She leaves. People scatter. B&B are left alone. Staring.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That chick was talking

					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. This is the best night of our

	WIDE SHOT. B&B just stand, laughing.
	
	MUSIC FADES BACK UP...
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
	
	ANGLE ON THE BAND, continuing the song.

	INT.  HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	A WOMAN ATTENDANT answers the phone.

			Good evening. Room service. How may

	From the phone...

			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	The woman's disturbed.
	
					WOMAN ATTENDANT
			Hello... Hello...
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
	
	B&B try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue. 
	Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor 
	hard.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Beavis is on the phone in the main room. Butt-Head sits on the

	INT.  B&B'S ROOM - MORNING
	
	BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it 
	and moving the whole thing.
	
	Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I wonder where this door goes to.
	
	Beavis comes over to check it out. Butt-Head opens the door. It's 
	one of those double doors to the next room.
	
	Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it.
	
	Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&B 
	inside. It's DALLAS, the girl Muddy sent them after.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
	
	She has them pinned against the wall. DALLAS is hot, clad in tight 
	leather, tattooed, pierced, sexy.
	
					BEAVIS
					(excited)
			Hey, Butt-Head, it's her! Heh heh.
	
					DALLAS
			All right, who are ya? C.I.A? F.B.I.?
			A.T.F.?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first?
	
					DALLAS
			You got two seconds!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
	
	Dallas grabs Butt-Head by the shirt.
	
					DALLAS
			Who sent ya?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we
			could do you. And he was gonna pay us.

			Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he

			Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a

					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No
			way.
	
					BEAVIS
					(considering it)
			Umm,... I don't know Butt-Head. That is
			a lot of money... Maybe if we close our
			eyes and pretend he's a chick...
	
	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis, bringing him to his senses.
	
	From outside, SOUND of a police siren. Dallas goes to the window. 
	The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
	
					DALLAS
					(panics)
			Damn! You boys, you wait right there.
	
	Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door.
	
	B&B look at each other. They start to take their pants off.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first! Me first!
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas gets binoculars from her bag and scouts outside.
	
	Her P.O.V. REVEALS dozens of police and A.T.F. cars. The hotel's 
	surrounded.
	
	As Dallas looks around, she spots a tour bus across the street. On 
	the side: "Dream America Tours." Dallas quickly dials the phone.
	
					DALLAS
					(to phone)
			Gimme the number for Dream America Tours.
			(pause) Right.
	
	Dallas dials again, crossing to the door to peek out at B&B - both 
	standing in their underwear, waiting. Beavis picks his nose. 
	Dallas closes the door again.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
					(to phone)
			Yeah, you got a bus leaving today? (pause)
			Five minutes? Where's it goin'? (listens)
			Washington, D.C.? (mulls it over) Perfect.

			tickets.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B are in their underwear. Butt-Head sits at the edge of the bed. 
	Beavis tries to pull the remote off the table.
	
	Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms 
	over Butt-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Forget it, bunghole!
	
	B&B start to wrestle. Dallas sees Beavis' pants.
	
					DALLAS
					(realizing)
			Score? You boys wanna...?
	
	Butt-Head grabs Beavis' neck.
	
					BEAVIS
			Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh.
	
	She picks up the pants, getting an idea.
	
					DALLAS
			You wait here.
	
	She takes the pants into the next room. B&B keep wrestling.
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh. No way, dude.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	TIGHT ON her black satchel. From it she lifts a delicate 
	electronic device, the X-5 unit, about the size of a credit card. 
	An LED light blinks.
	
	Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis' 
	pants, creating a natural pocket. She carefully slides the unit 
	in.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B's fight escalates. Butt-Head picks up a LAMP and throws it at 
	Beavis. It hits the wall and SHATTERS. Beavis charges Butt-Head.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas is licking a piece of thread. She quickly and expertly 
	threads a needle and then starts to sew the electronic device into 
	the inside back of Beavis' pants. She suddenly wrinkles her nose 
	as if she has smelled something.
	
	She holds the pants up to the light. Inside, the shadow of the 
	unit.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B fight wildly. Dallas enters and clears her throat. B&B freeze.

	Silence.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
			But first, you hafta do a little job for

			to do a job for me?
	
	Silence. They're in shock.

			OK guys, time to move out.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY/FRONT DOOR - DAY

			Remember, Washington, D.C. You'll get

	She kisses them both seductively.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
					(urgent)
			Your bus is downstairs. Get going.
	
	She shuts the door, leaving B&B outside. Nearby, a maid with her 
	cart passes by.
	
	B&B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator.
	
	ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER, out of B&B's view. Just as the elevator 
	doors shut, dozens of federal agents with guns rush in and kick 
	open Dallas' door.
	
	
	EXT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
	
	More Feds and police enter.
	
	ANGLE ON B&B, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks 
	away, Beavis rubs his butt.

	They walk to the tour bus across the street.

			No way butt-hole! I want the window.

			Cut it out butt-hole!
	
					A VOICE
			Why don't you take turns?
	
	They turn. It's Martha, the woman from the plane, sitting across 
	the aisle.

			Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the

					MARTHA
			Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?

	DRAMATIC REVEAL of AGENT RYAN FLEMMING entering the hallway. He's 
	an A.T.F. honcho, powerful, hard-ass. Looks like an Oliver North-
	type. Sounds something like Fred Thompson. He walks with his 
	assistant, AGENT BORK and another agent.
	
	They find Dallas' room and enter.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas sits calmly, confident, as agents tear apart the room.
	
					FLEMMING
			So, are you going to tell us where it is
			or am I going to have to have Agent Hurley
			over there give you another cavity search?
	
	ANGLE ON AGENT HURLEY, a tough, stocky woman.
	
					DALLAS
			Ooh is that a promise?
	
					FLEMMING
			Look Mrs. Scum, we know who you are. Tell

					BORK
			Dallas Grimes. Married to Muddy Grimes.
			You run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring.
	
	He tosses her some photos of her and Muddy.
	
					DALLAS
			Oh, you got my bad side.
	
	Bork hands Flemming another file. Flemming checks it.
	
					FLEMMING
			Three days ago you pulled a job at the
			Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada -
			where you stole... (reads) The X-5 unit.
			Now we happen to know you had the unit
			with you when you checked in here, so why
			don't you be a good girl and tell us where
			it is.
	
					DALLAS
			You gonna charge me with anything? (pause)
			I didn't think so. You wanna let me go now
			or wait 'till my lawyer files a wrongful
			arrest.
	
					BORK
					(aside to Flemming)
			We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place
			apart. We can only legally hold her for

	A glass wall separates this from the master control room. There,

	pipes from various angles.
	
	B&B are the last in. Beavis rubs his aching butt. The guide is 
	already speaking.

	The tour moves on.

					FLEMMING
			Did you give him a full cavity search?
	
					BORK
					(confused)
			Ah, the witness?
	
					FLEMMING
			Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
	
					BORK
			Well sir, I didn't really think it was

	TIGHT ON PICTURE. A still of B&B laughing on the elevator.

			That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows

			Uh...
	
	Butt-Head starts randomly hitting controls everywhere while Beavis 
	rubs his butt against a computer keypad.

	REVEAL Flemming's there with his agents. Flemming leans forward.

			You see what I see, Bork?
	
					BORK
			I see it. I don't get it.

			Damn right. Bork, we're dealing with real

			What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
	
					BORK
			Well, sir it's not good. (to an assistant)
			Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new
			top-secret biological weapon, a manmade
			virus...
	
	ON MONITOR. The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants.
	
					BORK (CONT.)
			The deadliest known to man. It could wipe
			out five states in five days. It can be
			activated by simply entering the right
			code. Here's what happened when it was
			tested on a group of Army recruits...
	
	ON THE MONITOR. Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling 
	around in pain on stretchers, dying. Grotesque (but funny).
	
					FLEMMING
			Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to
			fall into the wrong hands...
	
					BORK
			It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished.
			It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard
			enough, it could break open, releasing the
			virus.
	
	A murmuring through the room. Flemming rises and holds up a 
	picture of B&B.
	
					FLEMMING
			Okay People, as of right now these are the

			There are over two hundred active geysers

	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT
	
	B&B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire. 
	The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-
	Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from 
	Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B's.
	
	Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like 
	the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire, 
	hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
	
					DUMB GUY
					(mouth full)
			Yup. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Fire.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Here's another true story. About fifteen
			years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,
			called Highland...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Really? That's where we're from.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Well, then you know what I'm talking
			about. Anyway, here's the story. I
			scored with these two chicks. True story.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You scored with two chicks?!
	
					DUMB GUY
					(spaghetti dribbling from mouth)
			Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
	
					DUMBER GUY
			Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
	
	Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I
			scored with both of them...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, do you think these two sluts still
			live in Highland? That would be cool.
	
					DUMB GUY
					(after taking another big bite)
			Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
			Huh huh huh.
	
	Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to 
	drop his pants.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
	
	The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant 
	sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange 
	fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.
	
					B&B/DUMB GUY/DUMBER GUY (O.S.)
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS (O.S.)
			Fire.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - MORNING
	
	B&B wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is 
	scorching.
	
	B&B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.
	
	ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at 
	the sun, squinting.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(barely alive)
			The sun sucks.
	
	A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
	
					BEAVIS
					(to the vulture)
			Cut it out butt-hole!
	
	The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be
			like, water in cactuses?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(semiconscious)
			Uh...
	
	Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
					(sees something)
			Hey Beavis, check it out.
	
	IN FRONT OF B&B: Two vultures start humping.
	
					B&B
					(struggling to laugh)
			Huh huh huh (cough) huh huh (cough).
	
	
	EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY
	
	START ON SUN - over B&B?
	
	REVEAL it's over Muddy who looks at a picture of B&B held by an 
	A.T.F. agent.
	
					MUDDY
			No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope
			it's safe to drive around here.
	
					COP
			Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main
			roads. If they're around, they're probably
			hiding out in the desert.
	
					MUDDY
			That's good to know, Officer.
	
	Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - LATER
	
	B&B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're 
	barely able to talk.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my
			life is like, flashing in front of my
			eyes!
	
	BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him 
	sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the 
	exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, my life is cool!
	
	TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
			It's like a really long time ago...
	
	BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. 
	It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
	
					BEAVIS/SPERM
			Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
	
	Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.
	
	With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
	
					BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
			Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
	
	Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His 
	conception looks like a dumb accident.
	
	BACK ON BEAVIS:
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh I scored.
	
	Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
			I think I'm freaking out.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh? Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,
			everything looks all weird and...
	
	BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors 
	start shifting.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
			all these weird shapes and it's sort of
			like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
	
	Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
	
	THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It 
	could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the 
	lower left hand corner.
	
	I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of 
	something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This 
	is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... 
	fire!"
	
	The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but 
	I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White 
	Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
	
	BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
	
	We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. 
	The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
	
					FIRE
			I am God of Hellfire and I bring
			you...(music begins) Fire...
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
	
	THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball 
	of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
	
	At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in 
	bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.
	
	As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass 
	of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird 
	stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
	
	At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
	
	As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the 
	surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as 
	maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the 
	movie.)
	
	Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead 
	bodies.
	
	The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not 
	far from the side of a road all along.
	
					B&B
			Ahhhhghhhhgh!
	
	B&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them 
	with a shotgun.
	
					BEAVIS
			Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
			Heh heh heh. Water.
	
	Muddy aims his shotgun at B&B.
	
					MUDDY
			Ah'm gonna enjoy this. Any last words
			b'fore ah kill ya?
	
	B&B think.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt
			cheeks, huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say
			that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool, huh huh. (realizing) Hey Beavis
			that's that dude that's paying us to do
			his wife.
	
					BEAVIS
			Oh yeah. Can you just take us to
			Washington? We're gonna meet her there
			and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
	
					MUDDY
			Washington! That's where she was gonna
			meet up with ya? (realizes) Damn, she's
			goin' all the way!
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Muddy lowers the gun a bit.
	
					MUDDY
			You know, I just might need you after all.
			Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help
			me get mah unit back.
	
	Muddy pops it open. B&B climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them 
	and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (O.S.)
			Boy, it sure is hard to score. Huh huh
			huh.
	
	Muddy peels out.

			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to 
	bend.
	
	Suddenly, it pops open. B&B are a sweaty mess. They gasp.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks. Let's get outta here.
	
	They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis 
	stares dumbly.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh, you first.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			C'mon, Beavis, just start running really
			fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
	
					BEAVIS
			Okay. I'll go right after you.
	
	Butt-Head shoves Beavis out of the car.

			Ahhhhghghhghghgh!
	
	Beavis tries to run, but hits the road and flips over and over - 
	and smashes his butt.

			Owwwwww, my butt!!!!!!
	
	His body stops in the middle of the road. A huge truck, about to

			Huh huh huh huh huh. That was cool.

	Finally, he loses his grip as the lid to the trunk closes.

	Inside, she's folding clothes. (NOTE: If Clinton is not reelected,

	ANGLE ON the bushes.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	We see Butt-Head slowly emerge from the bushes. He looks up, 
	suddenly seeing:
	
	DOZENS OF A.T.F. AGENTS surround him, rifles trained.

	Butt-Head sits, disheveled.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, did I just score?
	
					HURLEY

	INT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
	
	In the main reception area, Beavis is surrounded by a few FOREIGN 
	DIGNITARIES who try to make sense of what he is saying.
	
					DIGNITARY #1
			Que es un "bunghole"? Que lengua es?
			Arabigo?
	
					DIGNITARY #2
			De donde eres tu?
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Arabigo? I am the Great Cornholio. I have
			no bunghole. Where I come from there is no
			T.P.
	
	A White House representative comes up. He assumes Beavis is with 
	the dignitaries.
	
					REPRESENTATIVE
			I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience
			gentlemen, but we're going to have
			outside for a moment. Follow me please.
	
	He leads them out, including Beavis who continues to babble.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			You can run but you cannot hide from the
			Almighty Bunghole! Heh heh hmm.
	
	
	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
	
	Beavis/Cornholio and the dignitaries are escorted out. Beavis, 
	unnoticed, keeps walking.
	
	Beavis, walking along stops. He sees something.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Aaaaahh...
	
	ON BEAVIS' P.O.V. across the street, we see what Beavis is looking 
	at:
	
	ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS. He takes the picture of Dallas out of his pocket.
	
	TIGHT ON the picture of Dallas.
	
	TIGHT ON Anderson's camper.
	
	TIGHT ON Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (CONT.)
			Aaaahh, heh heh...
	
	Beavis looks alternately at the camper and the picture a couple of 
	times, and then walks across the street.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (CONT.)
			Booiiing! Ptang ptang! Wagh-hah!!!
	
	Beavis goes into Anderson's camper and shuts the door.
	
	A Secret Service agent walks by, just missing Beavis.
	
	
	INT.  WHITE HOUSE/CORRIDOR OF PRESIDENTS - DAY
	
	Tom and Marcy enjoying a moment.
	
					TOM
			Boy I tell ya what, it really makes ya
			proud. I could stay here all day.
	
	An A.T.F. agent comes up and interrupts Tom.
	
					AGENT
			Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave...
	
					TOM
			Now wait just a minute...
	
					AGENT
			Now!
	
	NEARBY, Flemming and Bork are showing the police sketch of 
	Cornholio to Sandy and questioning her.

					TOM
			I tell ya what honey, this country's goin'
			to Hell in a handbasket.
	
	They get in the front. Tom adjusts the side-view mirror.
	
					TOM (CONT.)
			I'm gonna go over right now and talk to my
			Congressman about this...
	
	TOM'S P.O.V.: In the side-view mirror we see the camper SHAKING 
	and hear Beavis/Cornholio.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO (O.S.)
			Ooooaaaaaghhh!!! Whack-awhack-aaaaghh!!!
	
					TOM
			What the hell?...Wait here a minute...
	
	Tom gets out and goes into the camper.
	
	HOLD ON THE CAMPER DOOR.
	
	Tom throws Beavis/Cornholio out the door. Beavis is in his 
	underwear with his T-shirt still pulled over his head.
	
					TOM (CONT.)
			And if I ever catch ya whackin' in here
			again I'm gonna hog-tie ya! (to himself)
			Now I gotta straighten up in here.
	
	Tom goes back in the camper.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			You have offended my bunghole!
	
	
	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
	
	Bork reports to Flemming. Butt-Head is held by two agents.
	
					BORK
			We just cleared all four floors. No sign
			of him.
	
					FLEMMING
			Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've
			found him by now.
	
	Bork sees something. It's Beavis, about a hundred yards away.
	
					BORK
			Chief, look!
	
					FLEMMING
					(picks up radio)
			Attention all units. We've got him. He's
			in front of a camper in the visitor's lot.
	
	
	EXT.  OUTSIDE ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DAY
	
	Beavis stands, T-shirt still over his head. Suddenly, dozens of 
	agents surround him, pointing guns at him. Beavis seems oblivious 
	to the danger.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			I am the great Cornholio! I will lay waste
			to your bunghole! Heh heh.
	
	BEHIND THE AGENTS, Flemming approaches and gives orders.
	
					FLEMMING
			OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the
			unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't
			wanna take a chance on hitting it.
	
					BORK
			Where are his pants?
	
					FLEMMING
			Who knows?
	
	Beavis reaches to scratch his butt. Agents step back, cautious.
	
	Flemming picks up a bullhorn and addresses Beavis.
	
					FLEMMING (CONT.)
			This is Agent Flemming, A.T.F.. We won't
			hurt you. We just want the unit. Tell us
			where the unit is.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
	
					FLEMMING
			We'll get you whatever you want. (to
			agents) Get that other kid. We might need
			him.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
	
					BORK
					(on a radio)
			This is Bork. We need some T.P. and
			some...(to Flemming) What's he say?
	
	ANGLE BEHIND AGENTS. Butt-Head is brought in by two agents.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, this rules! Can I have a gun too?
			Huh huh huh.
	
	ON BEAVIS. He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			You must bow down to the Almighty
			Bunghole. (Beavis) Heh heh, this is cool.
			(Cornholio, chanting) Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to Bork)
			He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna
			have to take him out. Get ready to fire on
			my orders... (on bullhorn) This is your
			last chance. Give us the unit now...
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			(Beavis) Why does everyone wanna see my
			schlong? (Cornholio, chanting) I am the
			one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to agents)
			OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of
			three. (on bullhorn) I'm gonna give you
			three seconds...
	
	ANGLE ON AGENTS taking aim, cocking their guns.
	
					FLEMMING (CONT.)

			One...
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, chanting.

	Suddenly Tom Anderson throws open his camper door, holding Beavis' 
	pants.
	
					TOM
			And take yer damn pants with ya...!
			(noticing) What in the hell...?
	
					BORK
					(pointing)
			THE PANTS!!! He's got the unit!
	
	Suddenly all guns are on Anderson.
	
					FLEMMING
					(through bullhorn)
			Drop the pants! Now!
	
					TOM
			Wait a minute. I ain't the one...
	
	IN SLOW MOTION:
	
	A S.W.A.T. TEAM GUY lunges at Tom, grabbing the pants.
	
	Tom pulls away, causing the pants to RIP. THE UNIT GOES FLYING.
	
	A FROZEN MOMENT. SLOW MOTION.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
	
	TIGHT ON FACES IN THE CROWD.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT.

	TIGHT ON THE UNIT, FALLING, FALLING.
	
	IT HITS BUTT-HEAD'S HEAD, BOUNCES AND FALLS INTO HIS HANDS.
	
	The agents all stare at Butt-Head - quiet, not sure what to do.
	
	Butt-Head hands it to Flemming, nonchalant.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, here ya go. Huh huh huh.
	
	The crowd CHEERS.
	
	ON ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
	
	Tom is handcuffed roughly.
	
					TOM
			Now wait just a minute...
	
	An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas. Bork 
	grabs it and shows it to Tom.
	
					BORK
			How do you explain this?
	
	Flemming approaches Tom.
	
					FLEMMING
			Sooo, using two innocent teenagers as
			pawns in your sick game, huh?
	
					TOM
			I don't know what the hell...
	
					FLEMMING
					(disgusted)
			Take him away.
	
	Anderson is dragged away past a group of young, boy-scout types 
	who shake their heads in shame.
	
	ANGLE ON Beavis and Butt-head being interviewed by a reporter. 
	Beavis is in his underwear. Tom is being dragged away in the 
	background.
	
					BEAVIS
			I always thought there was something wrong

	B&B sit as Flemming paces in front of them. Beavis is no longer 
	Cornholio.
	
					FLEMMING
			I gotta admit, I didn't believe it. I
			thought you were scum. But you saved more
			lives today than you'll ever know. You led
			us to one of the sickest criminals in our
			history. This country owes you a debt.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, does that mean, like, we're gonna get
			money and stuff?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, and chicks! We were supposed to
			score.
	
					FLEMMING
			For security reasons, your actions will
			have to remain top secret. But someone
			very special wants to give his thanks.
	
	Flemming motions to the big chair. The PRESIDENT swivels around 
	and rises to shake hands with B&B.
	
					PRESIDENT
			Beavis and Butt-Head. On behalf of all
			your fellow Americans, I extend my deepest

	ON BEAVIS, seeing something, amazed, ecstatic.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh mmm, hey mmm Butt-Head! Look!
	
	Heavenly MUSIC. B&B stare at the wonder before them.

		The movie begins with scenes of people screaming in horror 
	and running down the streets of a big city. The ground shakes from 
	what seems like giant footsteps. There are pieces of building 
	debris falling everywhere, people getting crushed, power lines 
	coming down, etc. - complete pandemonium. It all looks very much 
	like a Japanese animated King-Kong or Godzilla movie. We hear the 
	footsteps getting closer and the ground shaking becomes more 
	intense - more debris falling. Then we see a HUGE BLACK TENNIS 
	SHOE come into frame and smash a National Guard truck. As we pan 
	up, we see the white socks, then the red shorts, the AC/DC T-
	shirt, then we hear the familiar, "Huh huh huh." - only it's a 
	huge sound...this is a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT TALL BUTT-HEAD. "Butt-
	Kong" continues his path of destruction - stomping on cars and 
	buildings and saying, "This is cool. Huh huh huh."
		Airplanes and tanks start firing at Butt-Head (Butt-Kong). 
	He looks irritated and says, "Cut it out butt-munch!" Butt-Head 
	swats at the planes, sending them crashing to the ground and 
	stomps on the tanks. Then, something catches his eye. Butt-Head 
	reaches into a skyscraper and picks up a nice looking woman - a 
	lot like the one from the King Kong movie. He looks down at her in 
	his hand and goes wide-eyed, "Whoa! Huh huh huh." The woman 
	screams in terror as Butt-Head looks down at her and tries a few 
	lame pick up lines. "Uuuuh...Hey baby. I'm like, pretty tall. Huh 
	huh huh." He swats down a helicopter that is circling his head, 
	"Dammit, I'm trying to score!" The helicopter goes down in flames. 
	We CUT TO some guys sitting on a tank firing at him. They notice 
	giant footsteps coming from the other direction and turn the tank 
	around. Through their binoculars we see a THREE-HUNDRED FOOT 
	BEAVIS coming from the horizon. The giant Beavis is even more 
	destructive than Butt-Kong (maybe he could be breathing fire). 
	Beavis starts trying to pick up on Butt-Head's woman. Butt-Head 
	puts the woman down and he and Beavis begin to go at it, leveling 
	the city with one of their stupid juvenile smack-fights.
		We CROSS-DISSOLVE from three-hundred foot Beavis shaking 
	Butt-Kong to Butt-Head asleep on the couch with Beavis shaking 
	him.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
	
	
					BEAVIS (O.C.)
			Butt-Head! Butt-Head! Hey, Butt-Head!
	
	Butt-Head is dead asleep on the couch. Beavis shakes him.
	
					BEAVIS
			Butt-Head, wake up, wake up!
	
	Butt-Head comes around.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit, Beavis, I was about to score.
			Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What's gone?
	
					BEAVIS
			The TV.
	
	Beavis is making STRANGE NOISES, in a state of shock.
	
	Butt-Head rubs his eyes and looks at the empty space where the TV 
	was.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uuuuuuh, huh huh. Uuh,...
	
	Out the window, we see two YOUNG MEN carrying B&B's TV into their 
	van.
	
	Still on the couch, Butt-Head looks over at the broken window. We 
	see a CROWBAR lying on the floor, and the front door left open.
	
	Butt-Head looks at the BROKEN WINDOW, at the CROWBAR, the OPEN 
	DOOR, then back at the EMPTY SPACE where the TV was. He does this 
	a couple of times - piecing it all together.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Whoa! I think I just figured something
			out Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS
			What?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh.
	
	Beavis is still in shock. They both stare at the empty space where 
	the TV was for a beat, not quite sure what to do.
	
	Beavis is SHAKING AND MAKING WEIRD NOISES. He presses buttons on 
	the remote a few times, as if it might help somehow.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks more than anything that
			has ever sucked before. We must find
			this butt-hole that took the TV.
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT
	
	Bad neighborhood. 70's music blares.
	
	A fast driving car drives right at us and stops. Punks run in 
	fear. Beavis hops out of the driver's seat, wearing bell-bottoms, 
	chain jewelry and a 70's afro. Into a dramatic CLOSE-UP, he takes 
	off his glasses.
	
	FREEZE ON BEAVIS
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Beavis!
	
	FRAME UNFREEZES. Beavis whips out a huge gun.
	
					BEAVIS
			Freeze, butt-wipe!
	
	An attacker comes from one side. Beavis uses Judo. Another tosses 
	a knife. Beavis ducks, then shoots with two hands, police style.
	
	
	INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT
	
	Swinger's pad. Totally 70's. A group of bikini'd girls on a 
	waterbed. Butt-Head approaches them. He wears a leisure suit, 
	collar way open. He plops down in the bed.
	
	FREEZE ON BUTT-HEAD
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Butt-Head!
	
	FRAME UNFREEZES. The girls wrap their arms around him.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. Come to Butt-Head, baby.
	
					ANNOUNCER
			Star in...
	
	
	MAIN TITLE - FULL FRAME
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREETS - DAY/NIGHT
	
	ACTION MONTAGE BEGINS. Styled like a 70's cop show opening.
	
	OPENING CREDITS to the movie appear just as cop show credits 
	would.
	
	Beavis does a Starsky and Hutch-style roll with a gun.
	
	Butt-Head slaps a pimp.
	
	Beavis drives, chasing a car.
	
	Butt-Head is slapped by a girl.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	Beavis and Butt-Head are in a warehouse shoot-out.
	
	A black police chief rises from a desk to yell at B&B.
	
	B&B dive for cover just before a building explodes.
	
	In CLOSE-UP, Beavis smiles for an ID shot.
	
	Butt-Head does the same.
	
	Beavis, in a rooftop fight, kicks his opponent over the edge.
	
	A beautiful woman, back to us, takes off her dress for Butt-Head. 
	FINAL OPENING CREDIT APPEARS. Butt-Head and the woman fall into 
	bed. Suddenly...
	
	
	INT.  SCHOOL HALLWAY/DOOR TO A.V. ROOM - DAY
	
	From inside, SOUND of equipment crashing.
	
	B&B come out wheeling a TV on one of those carts. There are cables 
	attached to it still leading back into the A.V. room. As they push 
	the cart we hear more equipment falling.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit, it's stuck.
	
	They give it one big push and it finally breaks free. We see that 
	the cables are tangled with cables from other TVs and VCRs, which 
	all come crashing to the ground.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Let's just wheel this
			thing back to the house.
	
	
	INT.  SCHOOL/ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY
	
	MR. VAN DRIESSEN stops B&B.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			Ah, excuse me boys. What's going on
			here?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, someone stole our TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah. We're just gonna use this one.
			Get outta the way. Heh heh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I'm afraid that TV belongs to the school.
			Mmmkay? You know, this could be a positive
			experience for you guys. There's a
			wonderful world out there when we discover
			we don't need TV to entertain us.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. He said "anus."
	
					BEAVIS
					(to himself)
			Entert-ain...us...an-us...Oh yeah! Heh 
			heh. Anus. Heh heh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
					(frustrated)
			Have you guys heard a word I've said?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah, "anus." Huh huh huh huh.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			Look, guys, just take the TV back to the
			A.V. room right now. And try to be a little
			more open-minded. Mmkay?
	
	Van Driessen leaves. B&B continue to wheel the cart home.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What a dork. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. He's a anus. Heh heh.
	
	
	EXT.  SCHOOL/STAIRWAY - DAY
	
	B&B arrive with the cart at the top of a stairway. They lamely 
	attempt to let it slowly down the steps. The cart is too top-heavy 
	and goes tumbling to the bottom of the stairs, shattering the TV.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			No it wasn't!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh,...Oh yeah.
	
	B&B stand at the top of the stairs looking down at the wrreckage. 
	PRINCIPAL McVICKER shows up by the TV.
	
					McVICKER
			Why.... You... You bastards... Ge...
			get out! You're suspended. One more
			screw up... and you're expelled.
	
	B&B walk off laughing.
	
	
	EXT.  THE ANDERSON'S DRIVEWAY - DUSK
	
	B&B walk up. There's a camper in the driveway.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, check it out Beavis. I didn't
			know Anderson had a Camper.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Maybe it has a TV.
			Heh heh. TV.
	
	B&B walk up to the camper and start to open the door just as MARCY 
	ANDERSON opens it. (As usual, she doesn't recognize them.)
	
					MARCY
			Oh, hello. Are you guys here to look
			at the refrigerator?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, no.
	
					BEAVIS
			We're here to look at the TV. Heh heh.
	
					MARCY
			Oh, I didn't realize it was broken.
			Come on in.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
	B&B walk into the camper. Marcy stays outside.
	
	
	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - SAME TIME
	
	Tom is adjusting the trailer-hitch. Marcy watches.
	
					TOM
			Well that oughtta hold her. Ya know,
			the most important thing you can have
			on a camper is a good propane regulator,
			and this here's the best one they make.
	
					MARCY
			I sure hope we can get the 'fridge fixed
			before we leave.
	
					TOM
			Now Marcy, we've been savin' for this trip
			our whole lives and we're gonna go come
			Hell or high water...
	
	Through the camper walls, we hear the faint sound of B&B 
	AIR/MOUTH-GUITARING "IRON MAN."
	
					TOM (CONT.)
			What the hell is that noise?
	
	
	INT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
	
	B&B watch a "Cops"-type show. Beavis gets up, goes to the 
	refrigerator and grabs a soda. The refrigerator is under the 
	counter on which the TV is sitting.
	
	Beavis takes a sip and then does a SPIT TAKE, SPRAYING SODA ALL 
	OVER THE TOP OF THE TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			AAAAAAGH!!! This crap is warm!
	
	ANGLE ON TV: The soda Beavis spit out drips into the inside of the 
	TV. We see smoke and hear SIZZLING AND SHORT CIRCUIT SFX. The TV 
	goes dead.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, you butt-hole! You broke it.
	
	
	EXT.  ANDERSON'S CAMPER - DUSK
	
	B&B come out. Tom notices them.		
	
					TOM
			Hey, what's goin' on here?
	
					MARCY
			They're here to fix the TV, Tom.
	
					TOM
			The TV ain't broken.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah it is. Huh huh huh.
	
	Tom adjusts his glasses as he looks at B&B.
	
	TOM'S BLURRY P.O.V.: We see B&B out of focus.
	
					TOM
			Hey wait a minute. You two look kinda
			familiar. Ain't you them kids that've
			been whackin' off in my tool shed?
	
					BEAVIS & BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: looking particularly guilty, eyes shifting back 
	and forth.
	
	B&B walk off, leaving Tom wondering.
	
	
	EXT.  STREET IN A SEEDY PART OF TOWN - JUST BEFORE DAWN
	
	B&B are having TV withdrawal. Butt-Head is bug-eyed. Beavis has 
	the shakes bad, arms folded like Dustin Hoffman in "Midnight 
	Cowboy."
	
					BEAVIS
			Nnnnooo. Oooooh nooooo.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What's your problem Beavis?
	
					BEAVIS
			I need TV now! Now! NNNNDAMMIT!!!
	
	Butt-Head stops short. He looks up. His face is bathed in a 
	golden, throbbing light.
	
	BUTT-HEAD'S P.O.V.: We see a flashing neon sign that says, "TV". 
	Pull back to show B&B are standing outside the Elite Motel Lodge, 
	featuring "Color TV" and "Air-Cooled Rooms", with "Special Nap 
	Rates."
	
	B&B stare up, as if at a god.
	
					BEAVIS
					(crazed)
			Heh heh. TV. Heh Teee Veee.
	
	
	EXT.  MOTEL COURT - CONTINUOUS
	
	Butt-Head tries the first door. It's locked. He tries the second 
	door. It's locked. He tries the third door. It opens.
	
	B&B's eyes bulge. Inside, PRINCIPAL McVICKER is lying across the 
	legs of an obvious prostitute, his pants pulled down. She SPANKS 
	him.
	
					McVICKER
			Please mmm... may I have another?!
	
	B&B LAUGH. McVicker hears and looks up.
	
					McVICKER (CONT.)
			Beavis and Butt-Head! Y...y...you
			bastards.
	
					BEAVIS
			Can we watch your TV?
	
					McVICKER
			Y... Y... You're expelled! Get out!
	
	Butt-Head closes the door, laughing, and starts to walk towards 
	the next door. The muffled sound of a SPANK can be heard followed 
	by McVicker asking for another.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
					BEAVIS
			Dammit! I need a TV now! We're missing
			everything!
	
	
	INT.  MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
	
	The only light in the room is a flickering TV. Sitting on the bed, 
	talking on the phone is MUDDY. He's a tough, mean looking red-neck 
	- a Jack Ruby type.
	
	On the nightstand next to him is a three-quarter drunk bottle of 
	bourbon and a manila envelope. On his lap is a big gun.
	
					MUDDY
			...Are you sure these guys can pull this
			off? It's gotta look like an accident...
	
	We hear a knock on the door and muffled B&B laughs.
	
					MUDDY (CONT.)
			Hold on a minute. That must be them now.
			I'll call you back. (Hangs up phone)...
			Come in!
	
	B&B walk in. Muddy turns on the light.
	
					BEAVIS
					(sounding suddenly sedated)
			Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Yer late.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Why? Did we miss American Gladiators?
	
	MUDDY'S P.O.V.: B&B are a drunken blur.
	
					MUDDY
			Well, Earl said you guys were young, but
			jeez... Oh well, as long as you can get
			the job done. So what are your names?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, Butt-Head.
	
					BEAVIS
			Beavis.
	
					MUDDY
			That's alright. I'd rather not know your
			real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm
			gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you
			ten grand plus expenses, all payable after
			you do her...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(full of innuendo)
			Do her? Huh huh.
	
					MUDDY
			That's right. I'm offering you ten grand
			plus expenses to do my wife. We gotta deal?
	
	Butt-Head stares in shock.
	
					BEAVIS
			Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your
			wife.
	
					BEAVIS
					(trembling)
			Nnnnaah...We need to watch TV DAMMIT!!!
	
	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis and pulls him aside.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, you butt-munch, this guy wants us
			to score with his wife. And he's gonna pay
			us. We can buy a new TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Oh, heh heh really? Cool. Heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to Muddy)
			Uh, huh huh... We'll do it, sir.
	
					MUDDY
			Okay, then let's get down to business.
	
	ANGLE ON THE BED. Muddy slaps down a picture of DALLAS, his wife. 
	Leather clad, biker, beautiful.
	
					MUDDY (CONT.)
			Here she is. Her name's Dallas. She ain't
			as sweet as she looks. She stole everything
			from me. Ya gotta watch out, 'cause she'll
			do you twice as fast as you'd do her.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, huh huh. Cool.
	
	Muddy plunks down PLANE TICKETS.
	
					MUDDY
			She's holed up in a hotel room in Las
			Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of
			hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the
			airport.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
	
					BEAVIS
			Can we watch some TV first?
	
	Muddy picks up the gun and SHOOTS the TV.
	
					MUDDY
			No.
	
	
	EXT.  CITY STREETS - MORNING
	
	Muddy driving his loud four-by-four like a maniac, drunk with 
	bloodshot eyes. B&B are in the back seat. He eyes them through the 
	rearview. Meanwhile, a cat bounces off the windshield with a 
	SHRIEK.
	
					MUDDY
			One more thing. Mah wife's got this
			leather satchel. It's black, about this
			big. I need ya to bring it back. It's
			real important. Sentimental value... Any
			questions so far?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, yeah. Does she have big hooters?
	
					MUDDY
			She sure does.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This is gonna be cool! Huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. Boooooiiiing!!!
	
					MUDDY
			Just make sure it looks like an 
			accident...
	
					BEAVIS
					(spastic)
			Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an
			accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have
			a drink on it.
	
	Muddy swigs the last swallow from his bottle of bourbon.
	
	
	EXT.  AIRPORT - EARLY MORNING
	
	In an overhead view, the four-by-four screeches up to the gate, 
	fishtails to a stop, throwing B&B onto the sidewalk, and peels 
	away.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			We're gonna get paid to score.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna
			get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, this is the greatest day of
			our lives. Huh huh huh.
	
	
	INT.  AIRPLANE - DAY
	
	B&B enter the plane. They sit down in the first two seats on the 
	right - in First Class. A flight attendant, DOLORIS approaches 
	them.
	
					DOLORIS
			Hi. Can I help you find your seats?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uuh, nah. These seats are OK.
	
					DOLORIS
			I think your tickets have you seated
			in row fourteen, coach. So why don't
			you just go ahead and move back, OK?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			That's OK. Someone else can have those.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, it's not that important to me,
			really. Those seats are too small anyways.
	
	Doloris yanks them out of their seats and leads them down the 
	aisle.
	
	ANGLE DOWN AISLE in coach. Doloris stops by a row where an elderly 
	woman, MARTHA, sits by the window. Next to her: Two empty seats.
	
					DOLORIS
			Here you are.
	
	She gestures to the seats and leaves. Beavis climbs in the middle, 
	Butt-Head in the aisle - still watching Doloris.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Hey Beavis. When she was leading us down
			here, huh huh, she touched my butt. Huh
			huh huh.
	
	Martha, her senses a bit dimmed from age, turns to B&B.
	
					MARTHA
			Hello there. Are you two heading for Las
			Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, we're gonna score.
	
					MARTHA
			I hope to score big there myself. I'm
			mostly going to be doing the slots.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. 
			Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in
			Las Vegas?
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, there are so many slots you won't
			know where to begin.
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa! heh heh. Hey Butt-Head, this chick
			is pretty cool. She says there's gonna be
			tons of sluts in Las Vegas! Heh heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
					MARTHA
			It's so nice to meet young men who are so
			well mannered.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. I'm gonna have money, and a
			big-screen TV and sluts everywhere!
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, that's nice.
	
					CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.)
					(through P.A.)
			Good morning. This is your captain
			speaking. Welcome aboard flight 151
			non-stop to Las Vegas. We ask that you
			turn your attention to the front of the
			cabin for pre-flight safety instructions.
	
	B&B see Doloris, stepping nearby to demonstrate the seat belt.
	
					ATTENDANT'S VOICE
			To fasten your seat belt, insert the free
			end into the coupling.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Insert. Huh huh huh.
	
	Doloris demonstrates. B&B are dumbfounded. It's too complicated.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Uh...
	
	They struggle to make their seat belts fit, getting each other's 
	parts.
	
					TAMMY (O.C.)
			Hi, I'm Tammy? Can I help you with that?
	
	Butt-Head looks up.
	
	From his P.O.V. we see a beautiful woman, TAMMY, smiling, her 
	hands reaching down. FALLING IN LOVE/HARP MUSIC STING plays.
	
	CLOSE on Butt-Head's lap as two female hands reach down and pull 
	one strap from between Butt-Head's legs.
	
	Butt-Head looks down at his lap as Tammy leans over him. A loud 
	CLICKING can be heard. Butt-Head stares blankly.
	
					TAMMY (CONT.)
			There you go. You're all set.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(stunned)
			I love you.
	
	Suddenly Martha buckles Beavis' belt. Tammy goes.
	
					BEAVIS
			Wait, I wanted her to do it.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
	
					CAPTAIN'S VOICE
			Flight attendants, please prepare for
			take-off.
	
	The engines start to hum. The plane is rolling.
	
	Butt-Head struggles to get his seat belt off. He does everything 
	but pull the handle. Beavis goes white with fear.
	
	The plane starts to shake. The engines rumble. Beavis starts to 
	freak.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey wait a minute. What's going on?!
	
	Butt-Head bangs away at his seat belt. Beavis looks out the window 
	and realizes they're in the air.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
					(screams)
			Aaaagh! We're gonna die!!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON COUPLE IN FRONT OF B&B:
	
					MAN
			D'ya hear that? Something must be wrong!
	
					WOMAN
			Oh my God!!!!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON CABIN, people start screaming. The plane quakes, lifting 
	up.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD, furiously pulling:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dammit! Huh huh. That chick wants me.
	
					BEAVIS
			Aggghg! We're gonna die! We're all
			gonna die!
	
	The plane arcs upward. Butt-Head finally gets the belt off as the 
	plane is in full thrust. He rises and goes tumbling backward down 
	the aisle.
	
	ON PEOPLE seeing Butt-Head flying, screaming in panic.
	
	In free fall:
	
	Butt-Head grabs the door to the hangable luggage. It all comes 
	tearing out.
	
	Butt-Head flies up, hitting several overhead luggage racks, which 
	open and spill their contents.
	
	Butt-Head lands in the galley, causing food to go flying and 
	coffee to pour freely.
	
	ON THE CABIN as the plane starts to level out. People stop their 
	screaming.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD, underneath the rubble, poking his head out. He's 
	directly across from the flight attendant station where Tammy is 
	strapped in.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh... could you, like, do that
			thing with my belt again?
	
	
	INT.  PLANE - LATER
	
	All's in order. Flight attendants roll the beverage cart up the 
	aisle. People read, relaxed.
	
	ON BEAVIS AND MARTHA. Martha is showing pictures of her 
	grandchildren. Beavis is showing the picture of Dallas that Muddy 
	gave him.
	
					BEAVIS
			I'm probably going to make out with her
			first before we, you know, get down...
	
					MARTHA
			You'll have to speak up son. I have this
			ringing in my ears. My doctor says it
			could be related to my heart
			palpitations. I've had two operations on
			my heart.
	
					BEAVIS
			Really? I poop too much.
	
					MARTHA
			Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... No, (louder) I poop too much. Then
			I get tired.
	
					MARTHA
			Well, if you find yourself getting tired,
			take a couple of these.
	
	She hands him a box of NoDrowz.
	
					MARTHA (CONT.)
			They perk me right up.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh, thanks.
	
	He pours the contents into his hand and chews them like candy. 
	Then his eyes open wide.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
					(strange)
			Uh, tastes like crap. Heh heh. Mmmmm.
	
	Beavis starts wolfing them down.
	
	
	INT.  PLANE - A BIT LATER
	
	Tammy passes out meals from a rolling cart. She works with 
	Doloris. Butt-head stands behind Tammy, attempting to hit on her.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to Tammy)
			So, uh huh huh, are you going to Las
			Vegas? Huh huh huh.
	
	Tammy ignores him and moves on, leaving Butt-Head there.
	
	ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD, looking down at something.
	
	PAN DOWN to reveal he's looking at a BEER on a fat guy's tray. The 
	guy's asleep.
	
	Butt-head picks up the beer.
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, nearby. The NoDrowz is starting to take effect. 
	Beavis starts shaking, babbling, staring cross-eyed at his fist, 
	etc. (pre-Cornholio stuff)
	
	Tammy reaches her next passenger.
	
					TAMMY
			Hi, we're serving dinner. Our selections
			tonight are chicken piccata or seafood
			gumbo...
	
					BEAVIS (O.S.)
			Piccata? Piccata! Picattatta tatta!
	
	Tammy moves forward, leaving Butt-Head standing there. In the 
	background, we see Beavis starting to quake, on the verge of 
	Cornholio mode.
	
					PASSENGER
			Does the gumbo have corn in it?
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS: Turned, facing the cabin, T-shirt pulled over his 
	head in full Cornholio mode.
	
					BEAVIS
			I am Cornholio! I need picatta for
			my bunghole!
	
					TAMMY
			You'll have to wait your turn sir.
	
					BEAVIS
			Are you threatening me? My bunghole
			will not wait!
	
	Beavis starts to wander down the aisle.
	
	ANGLE ON CURTAIN TO FIRST CLASS CABIN. Beavis enters. From the 
	other side, SOUND of screams. We hear several CALL BUTTONS being 
	pressed.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD. He approaches Tammy from behind. She ignores him.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I got a beer. Want some? Huh huh.
	
	ANGLE INSIDE THE COCKPIT.
	
	The PILOTS are relaxed and settled in when the door to the cockpit 
	slams open. Beavis is in the doorway SCREAMING.
	
					BEAVIS
			Bargarajjjaaaahhh!!! I am Cornholio!!
	
	The pilots SCREAM. The copilot jumps up so fast he causes coffee 
	to spill everywhere, including on the captain's lap. The captain 
	then jumps up, hitting the controls and SENDING THE PLANE INTO A 
	NOSE-DIVE.
	
	ON BUTT-HEAD
	
	In the back of the plane standing next to Tammy. He starts to take 
	a sip of beer. The nose-dive of the plane causes Butt-Head to go 
	FLYING TOWARDS THE FRONT OF THE PLANE.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			AAAAAHHH!!! Huh huh. AAAAHHH!!!
	
	Butt-Head bounces all overthe plane and then gets tangled up in 
	the curtain that separates first class and coach. It tears off, 
	and he continues to fly forward.
	
	COCKPIT
	
	The captain is desperately trying to regain control of the plane.
	
	Butt-Head slams into the cockpit, landing on the control panel 
	facing the captain.
	
					CAPTAIN
			Get the hell out of the cockpit!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh, you said...
	
					CAPTAIN
			NOW!!!
	
	The captain throws Butt-Head back behind him and pulls the plane 
	out of the dive.
	
	
	EXT.  LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING
	
	The plane lands.
	
	
	INT.  COCKPIT DOOR - EARLY EVENING
	
	The flight attendants, shaken, smile at a line of people 
	deplaning. The people are white with fear, some covered with 
	flecks of spilled food and other matter.
	
					ATTENDANTS
			Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.
	
	They grow silent and still as B&B pass by. Beavis takes the T-
	shirt off his head, coming down from Cornholio.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That was cool.
	
	
	INT.  TERMINAL/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY
	
	Arriving passengers are greeted. A family is reunited. Two 
	businessmen walk up to limo drivers holding cards with their 
	names. A reunited couple hugs.
	
	B&B look around in confusion.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, this is Las Vegas?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh. I thought there'd be
			casinos and lights and stuff.
	
	People greet and walk away. The place starts to clear out.
	
	One limo driver is left standing. He wears sunglasses and holds a 
	sign that reads: Beavis and Butt-Head.
	
	B&B look around. Except for the driver, they're alone.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding
			a sign?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check
			this out.
	
	B&B go up to him. Butt-Head turns around, drops his pants and 
	hangs a "B.A." at the guy.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					DRIVER
			Ah, excuse me. You wouldn't know where
			I can find these guys, would ya?
	
	He indicates the sign. Butt-Head turns around and pulls up his 
	pants. They look and try to read:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(reads)
			Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
	
					BEAVIS
					(reads)
			Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(realizes)
			Huh huh. This says Beavis.
	
					BEAVIS
			And Boot-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			That's Butt-Head. Don't you get it,
			Beavis. These dudes have the same name as
			us.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, we should party.
	
	The limo driver rolls his eyes and walks away.
	
					DRIVER
			This way, sirs.
	
	B&B follow the driver away. Beavis looks around.
	
					BEAVIS
			So where's those guys?
	
	
	EXT.  MUDDY'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	HARLAN and ROSS, the two dumb-looking rough-necks that stole B&B's 
	TV are standing outside Muddy's motel room. Harlan knocks on the 
	door.
	
					ROSS
			Where the hell is he?
	
					HARLAN
			You sure this is the right place?
	
	Harlan looks through the window and sees the shattered TV. No 
	one's there.
	
	Muddy's four-by-four SQUEALS into the lot and skids to a stop next 
	to Harlan and Ross' van. Muddy gets out, looking really drunk now.
	
					HARLAN (CONT.)
			You Muddy?
	
					MUDDY
					(slurring)
			You the cops?
	
					ROSS
			Uh, no. Earl sent us. You know, to take
			care of your wife...
	
	Muddy grabs Ross by the collar.
	
					MUDDY
			What the hell?!... What about those other...
	
					ROSS
			Huh?
	
	Muddy tosses Ross to the sidewalk and starts back to they four-by-
	four.
	
					MUDDY
			Dammit!!! She did it to me again!!!
	
					HARLAN
			Hey, I noticed your TV was broken. You
			wanna buy a new one?
	
	Muddy gets in the four-by-four and starts it.
	
					MUDDY
			I'm gonna go to Vegas and kill all
			three a' them!
	
	Harlan and Ross seem momentarily confused.
	
	Muddy revs the engine, peels out backwards HITTING THE FRONT OF 
	THE VAN. This causes B&B's TV and some other loot to spill out the 
	back onto the sidewalk.
	
	Ross starts to pick it up.
	
					HARLAN
			Just leave it. Worthless piece o' crap.
	
					ROSS
			Yeah, really. We gotta start stealin'
			from rich people.
	
	
	EXT.  LAS VEGAS - DAY
	
	MONTAGE SONG BEGINS.
	
		Note: I would like this to be a well-known band (Red Hot 
		Chili Peppers) doing their best imitation of a modern Las 
		Vegas lounge act. I think a song like "What Am I Gonna Do 
		With You" by Barry White or something obnoxious like 
		"Bicostal" by Peter Allan would be cool. Or maybe Sinatra's 
		"You Make Me Feel So Young" would be best.
	
	The car passes by major hotels and tourist sights, finally pulling 
	up to a big luxurious hotel and casino.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
	
	Establishing shots. Excitement. Gambling tables going on forever.
	
	ON THE LOUNGE BAND playing the song we've been hearing. They 
	should vaguely resemble the actual band doing the song.
	
	PAN DOWN rows of slot machines.
	
	PAN ACROSS DEALERS handling cards and chips.
	
	DOLLY RIGHT UP TO B&B, staring in utter awe.
	
	REVERSE ANGLE REVEALS: They're staring at a huge Roman statue of a 
	bare-chested woman.
	
	Their faces are blank. They're seeing God. Finally:
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis. This is what it's all about.
	
					BEAVIS
					(speechless)
			Heh heh. Yeah.
	
	
	EXT.  VEGAS - DUSK
	
	Lights are popping on.
	
	Billboards and signs are lighting up.
	
	The whole strip is coming alive. Pure excitement.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DUSK
	
	ON B&B, still staring at the statue.
	
					B&B
					(in awe)
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	A security guard comes and drags B&B away.
	
	ON THE LOUNGE BAND, continuing the song we've been hearing.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	The door is opened by a bellboy.
	
					BELLBOY
			I'm so sorry about that little
			misunderstanding. We didn't know you
			were registered guests. Here's some
			playing chips compliments of...
	
	Beavis rushes in and grabs the remote which is attached to the 
	night table. He tries to pull it up and can't.
	
					BEAVIS
			This remote's too heavy!
	
					BELLBOY
			Sir, it's attached to the...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Here, dumbass! Let me try!
	
	They both struggle to pull it up. Finally, they fall over 
	backwards.
	
	Annoyed, the bellboy leaves.
	
	
	INT.  ELEVATOR BANK/9TH FLOOR - NIGHT
	
	The elevator arrives. B&B get on. There's several sophisticated 
	people. From inside, a computerized FEMALE ELEVATOR VOICE:
	
					ELEVATOR VOICE
			Ninth floor, going down.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Going down. Huh huh huh.
	
	The sophisticated people look repulsed. The doors close.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
	
	MUSIC DIPS DOWN FOR DIALOGUE. B&B step off the elevator and walk 
	among the gambling tables.
	
	Beavis pulls one of the playing chips out of his pocket and bites 
	into it.
	
					BEAVIS
			Ow! These chips suck.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find
			that chick.
	
	Beavis tosses the chip on a roulette table.
	
	ANGLE ON THE WHEEL. The ball lands on 13.
	
	At the table, the DEALER...
	
					DEALER
			13. We have a winner. (to Beavis) Sir,
			your chips?
	
					BEAVIS
			I don't want 'em! Keep 'em.
	
					DEALER
			Let it ride!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to dealer)
			Uh... could you help us find a chick?
	
					DEALER
					(uneasy)
			Sir, the casino does not partake in that
			kind of activity.
	
	The wheel stops.
	
					DEALER (CONT.)
					(amazed)
			13! Winner!
	
	People oooh and aaah. More gather to watch.
	
	Through the gathering throng comes CHERYL, a hooker.
	
					CHERYL
			Excuse me, boys. Did I hear you say 
			you're looking for a date?
	
	B&B freeze, shocked.
	
					CHERYL (CONT.)
			I'm Cheryl, and I can show you a real
			fine time.
	
	B&B don't move. The dealer rolls again.
	
					CHERYL (CONT.)
			A time you'll remember for the rest of
			your lives, if you know what I mean.
	
					DEALER
					(to Beavis)
			Sir, do you want your chips?
	
					BEAVIS
			No, Dammit! I don't want any chips!
	
					DEALER
			Let it ride.
	
	Cheryl puts her hands on their thighs.
	
					CHERYL
			What say we three go up to your room, 
			take off our clothes and just see what
			comes up.
	
	B&B's eyes open wide.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... Uh...
	
	The wheel stops.
	
					DEALER
			14. No winners.
	
					CHERYL
			Hmmmm. Oh well.
	
	She leaves. People scatter. B&B are left alone. Staring.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. That chick was talking
			about doing it.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. This is the best night of our
			lives.
	
	WIDE SHOT. B&B just stand, laughing.
	
	MUSIC FADES BACK UP...
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOUNGE - NIGHT
	
	ANGLE ON THE BAND, continuing the song.
	
	Tourists watch from tables - decidedly not rocking out.
	
	B&B dance alone near the stage, doing the "butt-knocker."
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL OFFICE - NIGHT
	
	A WOMAN ATTENDANT answers the phone.
	
					WOMAN ATTENDANT
			Good evening. Room service. How may
			I help you?
	
	From the phone...
	
					B&B
					(on phone)
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	The woman's disturbed.
	
					WOMAN ATTENDANT
			Hello... Hello...
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT
	
	B&B try to climb up and grab the gigantic boobs of the statue. 
	Butt-Head falls, knocks Beavis off and they both hit the floor 
	hard.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
	
	Beavis is on the phone in the main room. Butt-Head sits on the 
	toilet and speaks from the phone in the bathroom.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, I'd like to be serviced...
			in my room.
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

	B&B keep dancing as the famous BAND plays the MONTAGE SONG which 
	ENDS.
	
	
	EXT.  VEGAS - DAWN
	
	Sunrise.
	
	The song rings out.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S ROOM - MORNING
	
	BEavis is picking up the night table by the remote attached to it 
	and moving the whole thing.
	
	Butt-Head approaches a door next to the bed.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I wonder where this door goes to.
	
	Beavis comes over to check it out. Butt-Head opens the door. It's 
	one of those double doors to the next room.
	
	Butt-Head tries to open the second door, jiggling it.
	
	Suddenly, the door opens. Someone reaches out and pulls B&B 
	inside. It's DALLAS, the girl Muddy sent them after.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
	
	She has them pinned against the wall. DALLAS is hot, clad in tight 
	leather, tattooed, pierced, sexy.
	
					BEAVIS
					(excited)
			Hey, Butt-Head, it's her! Heh heh.
	
					DALLAS
			All right, who are ya? C.I.A? F.B.I.?
			A.T.F.?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first?
	
					DALLAS
			You got two seconds!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
	
	Dallas grabs Butt-Head by the shirt.
	
					DALLAS
			Who sent ya?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we
			could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
	
					DALLAS
			Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he
			payin' ya?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, ten uh...
	
					DALLAS
			Ten grand? That cheap-ass... I got a
			better deal for ya. I'll double it. I'll
			pay ya twenty if you go back there and do
			mah husband.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, you want us to do a guy? Huh huh. No
			way.
	
					BEAVIS
					(considering it)
			Umm,... I don't know Butt-Head. That is
			a lot of money... Maybe if we close our
			eyes and pretend he's a chick...
	
	Butt-Head SMACKS Beavis, bringing him to his senses.
	
	From outside, SOUND of a police siren. Dallas goes to the window. 
	The place is being surrounded by police and plain black cars.
	
					DALLAS
					(panics)
			Damn! You boys, you wait right there.
	
	Dallas goes into the next room and closes the door.
	
	B&B look at each other. They start to take their pants off.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first! Me first!
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas gets binoculars from her bag and scouts outside.
	
	Her P.O.V. REVEALS dozens of police and A.T.F. cars. The hotel's 
	surrounded.
	
	As Dallas looks around, she spots a tour bus across the street. On 
	the side: "Dream America Tours." Dallas quickly dials the phone.
	
					DALLAS
					(to phone)
			Gimme the number for Dream America Tours.
			(pause) Right.
	
	Dallas dials again, crossing to the door to peek out at B&B - both 
	standing in their underwear, waiting. Beavis picks his nose. 
	Dallas closes the door again.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
					(to phone)
			Yeah, you got a bus leaving today? (pause)
			Five minutes? Where's it goin'? (listens)
			Washington, D.C.? (mulls it over) Perfect.

			tickets.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B are in their underwear. Butt-Head sits at the edge of the bed. 
	Beavis tries to pull the remote off the table.
	
	Dallas enters, sees this sight, and shuts off the TV. She looms 
	over Butt-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Forget it, bunghole!
	
	B&B start to wrestle. Dallas sees Beavis' pants.
	
					DALLAS
					(realizing)
			Score? You boys wanna...?
	
	Butt-Head grabs Beavis' neck.
	
					BEAVIS
			Ow, let go, Butt-Head!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh.
	
	She picks up the pants, getting an idea.
	
					DALLAS
			You wait here.
	
	She takes the pants into the next room. B&B keep wrestling.
	
					BEAVIS
			Me first.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh. No way, dude.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	TIGHT ON her black satchel. From it she lifts a delicate 
	electronic device, the X-5 unit, about the size of a credit card. 
	An LED light blinks.
	
	Using her switchbalde, she cuts a hole in the back seam of Beavis' 
	pants, creating a natural pocket. She carefully slides the unit 
	in.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B's fight escalates. Butt-Head picks up a LAMP and throws it at 
	Beavis. It hits the wall and SHATTERS. Beavis charges Butt-Head.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/OTHER ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas is licking a piece of thread. She quickly and expertly 
	threads a needle and then starts to sew the electronic device into 
	the inside back of Beavis' pants. She suddenly wrinkles her nose 
	as if she has smelled something.
	
	She holds the pants up to the light. Inside, the shadow of the 
	unit.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' SUITE/MAIN ROOM - DAY
	
	B&B fight wildly. Dallas enters and clears her throat. B&B freeze.
	
	FULL ON DALLAS, posed sexily, seductive.

					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.

			This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're

			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh

	Silence.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
			But first, you hafta do a little job for
			me. (touches seductively) Would you like
			to do a job for me?
	
	Silence. They're in shock.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
			Here's what it is. I want ya to take a bus

			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.

			OK guys, time to move out.
	
	
	INT.  HOTEL LOBBY/FRONT DOOR - DAY

	She kisses them both seductively.
	
					DALLAS (CONT.)
					(urgent)
			Your bus is downstairs. Get going.
	
	She shuts the door, leaving B&B outside. Nearby, a maid with her 
	cart passes by.
	
	B&B stare, frozen for a beat, then go running for the elevator.
	
	ANGLE AROUND THE CORNER, out of B&B's view. Just as the elevator 
	doors shut, dozens of federal agents with guns rush in and kick 
	open Dallas' door.
	
	
	EXT.  HOTEL/CASINO - DAY
	
	More Feds and police enter.
	
	ANGLE ON B&B, walking past, oblivious to all else. As he walks 
	away, Beavis rubs his butt.

			Huh huh huh huh huh.

			This is gonna be cool. Huh huh.
	
	They walk to the tour bus across the street.

			No way butt-hole! I want the window.
	
					BEAVIS
			Cut it out butt-hole!
	
					A VOICE
			Why don't you take turns?
	
	They turn. It's Martha, the woman from the plane, sitting across 
	the aisle.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the

					MARTHA
			Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?

	We PAN back to the hotel as Muddy arrives in a cab.
	
	
	INT.  HALLWAY OUTSIDE DALLAS' ROOM - DAY
	
	DRAMATIC REVEAL of AGENT RYAN FLEMMING entering the hallway. He's 
	an A.T.F. honcho, powerful, hard-ass. Looks like an Oliver North-
	type. Sounds something like Fred Thompson. He walks with his 
	assistant, AGENT BORK and another agent.
	
	They find Dallas' room and enter.
	
	
	INT.  DALLAS' HOTEL ROOM - DAY
	
	Dallas sits calmly, confident, as agents tear apart the room.
	
					FLEMMING
			So, are you going to tell us where it is
			or am I going to have to have Agent Hurley
			over there give you another cavity search?
	
	ANGLE ON AGENT HURLEY, a tough, stocky woman.
	
					DALLAS
			Ooh is that a promise?
	
					FLEMMING
			Look Mrs. Scum, we know who you are. Tell
			her Bork.
	
					BORK
			Dallas Grimes. Married to Muddy Grimes.
			You run a mom and pop arms smuggling ring.
	
	He tosses her some photos of her and Muddy.
	
					DALLAS
			Oh, you got my bad side.
	
	Bork hands Flemming another file. Flemming checks it.
	
					FLEMMING
			Three days ago you pulled a job at the
			Army Research Facility in Hadley, Nevada -
			where you stole... (reads) The X-5 unit.
			Now we happen to know you had the unit
			with you when you checked in here, so why
			don't you be a good girl and tell us where
			it is.
	
					DALLAS
			You gonna charge me with anything? (pause)
			I didn't think so. You wanna let me go now
			or wait 'till my lawyer files a wrongful
			arrest.
	
					BORK
					(aside to Flemming)
			We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place
			apart. We can only legally hold her for
			another couple of hours.

					FLEMMING
			Did you give him a full cavity search?
	
					BORK
					(confused)
			Ah, the witness?
	
					FLEMMING
			Yes. You can never be too careful Bork.
	
					BORK
			Well sir, I didn't really think it was

			have a look.
	
	TIGHT ON PICTURE. A still of B&B laughing on the elevator.

			They look like a couple of kids chief.

	Suddenly the lights blink on and off. All three men look up.
	
	
	INT.  HOOVER DAM/CONTROL ROOM - DUSK
	
	We see a bank of TV monitors, video of water, turbines, etc. 
	Beavis is rubbing his butt against a switch on the console, 
	causing the lights to blink on and off.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
	
					BEAVIS
			My butt's bothering me!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You should kick your butt's ass. Huh huh

	Butt-Head looks at the bank of monitors - all showing water.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Dammit, all they have is shows about

					BEAVIS
			That sucks. Heh heh. They need some shows

	Butt-Head starts randomly hitting controls everywhere while Beavis 
	rubs his butt against a computer keypad.

			What's the scoop on that stolen unit?
	
					BORK
			Well, sir it's not good. (to an assistant)
			Roll the tape... The X-5 unit is a new
			top-secret biological weapon, a manmade
			virus...
	
	ON MONITOR. The device that was put in back of Beavis' pants.
	
					BORK (CONT.)
			The deadliest known to man. It could wipe
			out five states in five days. It can be
			activated by simply entering the right
			code. Here's what happened when it was
			tested on a group of Army recruits...
	
	ON THE MONITOR. Army recruits coughing up black gunk, rolling 
	around in pain on stretchers, dying. Grotesque (but funny).
	
					FLEMMING
			Jesus Jumped-Up Christ! If this were to
			fall into the wrong hands...
	
					BORK
			It gets worse. The unit wasn't finished.
			It has a flaw - the casing. If hit hard
			enough, it could break open, releasing the
			virus.
	
	A murmuring through the room. Flemming rises and holds up a 
	picture of B&B.
	
					FLEMMING
			Okay People, as of right now these are the

	for. They all rush back to the bus, leaving B&B behind.
	
					RECORDING (V.O.)
			You may wonder, how can wood get so hard?
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Through the window, we see the bus drive away.
	
	ANGLE ON AN OLD RANGER behind a counter, looking at B&B. He sees 
	their A.T.F. photo nearby and reaches for a phone.

					BEAVIS
			Hey, where'd those chicks go?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... I think you scared them off.
	
					BEAVIS
			This sucks. What are we doing here?
			Weren't we suppost'a go to Washington and
			score or something?
	
	From the car, a tourist couple heads into the building.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(to couple)
			Uh, do you know where Washington is?
	
					TOURIST MAN
			Yeah, 'bout 2000 miles that way.
	
	He points to the desert, then continues into the building.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool. Huh huh huh.
	
	B&B walk off into the desert.
	
	
	EXT.  PETRIFIED FOREST TOURIST CENTER - LATER
	
	The place is crawling with A.T.F.  Flemming walks out with Bork 
	and the OLD RANGER.
	
					FLEMMING
			Didn't see which way they went. Didn't see
			their vehicle. I don't suppose you tried
			to stop them?
	
					OLD RANGER
			The most dangerous guys in America? Not
			me, Sonny. I make nine dollars an hour.
	
					FLEMMING
			National security is the responsibility of
			every American. Bork...
	
					BORK
			Cavity search...?
	
					FLEMMING
			Deep and hard.
	
	Agents lead the old Ranger away.
	
					FLEMMING (CONT.)
			They're not gonna get away this time. I

	Agents load guns.
	
	Agents pile up sandbags and prepare for battle.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - DAY
	
	WIDE SHOT. A wasteland. Scorching desert hear. B&B, small in 
	frame, look lost. They're parched, weak.
	
					BEAVIS
			This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This desert is stupid. They need to put a
			drinking fountain out here.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah or like a Seven-Eleven or
			something... Are we almost there?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, probably like, another five minutes or
			something.
	
	ANGLE FROM OVERHEAD. Lost, alone, B&B wobble like they haven't 
	long to live. Overhead, vultures circle.
	
	ANGLE ON B&B, exhausted, spent. Staring ahead, Butt-Head suddenly 
	sees something.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			Whoa! Check it out!
	
	Beavis clears his eyes and sees it too.
	
					B&B
			Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.
	
	Excited, saved, they rush weakly forward.
	
	B&B'S P.O.V. REVEALS they rush to: A GIANT BIG SCREEN TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Turn it on! Turn it on!
	
	As they get closer it disappears - just a mirage.

			Dammit!!!! Dammit!!!!
	
	ANGLE ON SUN, brightening. The FRAME WHITES OUT.
	
	
	EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY
	
	Cars are backed up into the horizon.
	
	The car up front is waved on. Up next: Tom and Marcy. An agent 
	steps over and shows the picture of B&B.
	
					TOM
			Something wrong, Officer?
	
					AGENT
			Sir, we're looking for these two
			fugitives.
	
	ANDERSON SQUINTS to see.
	
	HIS P.O.V. REVEALS the photo out of focus.
	
					ANDERSON
			Why I'll be danged. It's those boys been
			whackin' off in my camper...
	
					AGENT
			You saw these two?
	
					ANDERSON
			I sure did. They were whackin' off in my
			tool shed. Then whackin' off in my camper.
			I never seen so much whackin' off.
	
	The agent steps back and shouts into his walkie-talkie:
	
					AGENT
			Blue Den this is post nine! I have
			positive ID!! (to Tom) Sir, I'm gonna have
			to ask you and your wife to step out of
			the vehicle.
	
					ANDERSON
			Well you see, me and the missus are on our

	The agent pulls his gun and orders:
	
					AGENT
			Now!!!!
	
	
	EXT.  SIDE OF HIGHWAY/JUST OFF ROADBLOCK - DAY
	
	A BIT LATER. Agents swarm over Tom's camper, turning everything 
	upside, pulling out dishes, trashing everything.
	
					TOM
					(furious)
			Now wait right there. You're dealing with
			a veteran of two foreign wars. They're the
			ones been whacking off. If I find anything
			broken in there, you and I are gonna
			tangle!
	
	An A.T.F. agent smashes the micro on the ground and sifts through 
	the pieces.
	
	Nearby, Flemming and Hurley watch.
	
					FLEMMING
					(appalled)
			Masturbating in a man's camper! We're
			dealing with two sick individuals. I want
			that camper torn apart, full cavity
			searches all around.
	
	SNAP! SFX as Agent Hurley puts on her rubber gloves and leads Tom 
	and Marcy away.
	
	Agent Bork runs up to Flemming.
	
					BORK
			Chief - just came in! Two days ago,
			Express Airways had a disturbance by
			someone calling himself - Cornholio. Guess
			who matches the description?
	
	He holds up a police sketch of Cornholio. Flemming walks to a 
	nearby chopper. SOUND of engine revving. Others follow.
	
					FLEMMING
			Finally, a real break. Get me that
			flight's point of origin. We're gonna kick
			some ass.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - DAY
	
	B&B walk along in the scorching heat. Ahead of them they see a 
	DUMB GUY and a DUMBER GUY with motorcycles parked. They are trying 
	to start a camp fire, LAUGHING.
	
					DUMB GUY
					(to B&B)
			Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(dehydrated)
			Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
	
	
	INT.  B&B'S HOME - DAY
	
	Peaceful. Empty. Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents break in, guns 
	ready, searching every corner. They tear it apart.
	
	
	EXT.  B&B'S TOWN/STREETS - DAY
	
	Agents rush down the business streets. People are in a panic. It's 
	like an invasion.
	
	ANGLE ON ELITE MOTOR LODGE - ON B&B'S TV SET as agents rush by, 
	knocking it over with a crash.
	
	
	INT.  VAN DRIESSEN'S CLASS - DAY
	
	Guitar in hand, Van Driessen sings:
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			She flies so gracefully,
			over rocks, trees and sand. Soaring over
			cliffs and gently
			floating down to land.
			She proudly lifts her voice
			to sound her mating call.
			And soon her mate responds
			by singing... "Caw, Caw, Caw."
			Come with me, Lesbian Seagull.
			Settle down and rest with me...
	
	Suddenly dozens of A.T.F. agents crash into the room. The door 
	bashes in, knocking Van Driessen down hard and crushing his 
	guitar.
	
	Flemming enters. Behind him, McVicker.
	
					McVICKER
			Uh...uh...uh that's him. He's their
			teacher.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			What's going on here?
	
					FLEMMING
			I'll ask the questions. Are these your
			students?
	
	He shows a picture of B&B.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I assume you're a government agent. I
			would think you would know there's
			something in this country called due
			process.
	
					FLEMMING
			That's about the kind of talk I'd expect
			from the guy who taught these two. Take
			this scum away.
	
					VAN DRIESSEN
			I believe I'm supposed to be read my
			Miranda Rights...
	
	An agent interrupts, punching Van Driessen in the gut. He's taken 
	away. Flemming turns menacingly to McVicker.
	
					McVICKER
			I...I...I always knew they were no good.
			I... I... I hate them!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to McVicker)
			You've been harboring two criminal
			masterminds!
	
	Bork rushes up to Flemming with a paper.
	
					BORK
			Chief, you know that guy whose camper they
			were whacking off in?
	
					FLEMMING
					(appalled)
			Bork! You are a federal agent. You
			represent the United States Government...
			Never end a sentence with a preposition.
			Try again.
	
					BORK
			Oh, ah... You know that guy in whose
			camper they... I mean that guy off in
			whose camper they were whacking?
	
					FLEMMING
			That's better. Yes?
	
					BORK
			We've run a sample through the National
			Criminal Sperm Bank and come up with two
			possible genetic matches for a father.
			(holds up photos)
	
	TIGHT ON PHOTO. It's the DUMB GUY and DUMBER GUY from the desert.

			Former Motley Crue members turned

	Flemming takes the paper and marches off. Others follow.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - NIGHT
	
	B&B and the Dumn abd Dumber Guys are sitting around a campfire. 
	The Dumb Guy looks like an older, more stupid, version of Butt-
	Head. The Dumber Guy is a couple of evolutionary scales down from 
	Beavis. Their relationship is an exaggerated version of B&B's.
	
	Butt-Head is staring at the Dumb Guy in admiration. Beavis, like 
	the Dumber Guy, appears to be just staring at the fire, 
	hypnotized. Dumb Guy is eating spaghetti out of a can.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
	
					DUMB GUY
					(mouth full)
			Yup. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Fire.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Here's another true story. About fifteen
			years ago, we stopped in this, uh, toilet,
			called Highland...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Really? That's where we're from.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Well, then you know what I'm talking
			about. Anyway, here's the story. I
			scored with these two chicks. True story.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You scored with two chicks?!
	
					DUMB GUY
					(spaghetti dribbling from mouth)
			Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
	
					DUMBER GUY
			Ih hih hih hih hih hih.
	
	Dumb Guy punches Dumber Guy in the head with a closed fist.
	
					DUMB GUY
			Shut up, dumb-ass! You didn't score. I
			scored with both of them...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, do you think these two sluts still
			live in Highland? That would be cool.
	
					DUMB GUY
					(after taking another big bite)
			Hey, you wanna see something really cool?
			Huh huh huh.
	
	Dumb Guy gets up, turns his butt towards the fire and starts to 
	drop his pants.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT/LONG SHOT - CONTINUOUS
	
	The campfire is in the distance, middle of nowhere. A flatulant 
	sound is heard. Suddenly, a big beautiful purple and orange 
	fireball erupts, lighting up the sky.
	
					B&B/DUMB GUY/DUMBER GUY (O.S.)
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS (O.S.)
			Fire.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - MORNING
	
	B&B wake up. The Dumb Guy and Dumber Guy are gone. The sun is 
	scorching.
	
	B&B inch forward - spent, dehydrated, near death.
	
	ANGLE ON GROUND as B&B collapse into frame. Butt-Head looks up at 
	the sun, squinting.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(barely alive)
			The sun sucks.
	
	A vulture picks at Beavis' shirt. Beavis SMACKS the vulture.
	
					BEAVIS
					(to the vulture)
			Cut it out butt-hole!
	
	The vulture moves revealing a PEYOTE CACTUS. Beavis looks at it.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, isn't there supposed to be
			like, water in cactuses?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(semiconscious)
			Uh...
	
	Beavis takes a bite of the cactus, chews and then coughs.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
					(sees something)
			Hey Beavis, check it out.
	
	IN FRONT OF B&B: Two vultures start humping.
	
					B&B
					(struggling to laugh)
			Huh huh huh (cough) huh huh (cough).
	
	
	EXT.  ROADBLOCK - DAY
	
	START ON SUN - over B&B?
	
	REVEAL it's over Muddy who looks at a picture of B&B held by an 
	A.T.F. agent.
	
					MUDDY
			No, I can't say I've seen 'em. I sure hope
			it's safe to drive around here.
	
					COP
			Don't worry, sir. Just stick to the main
			roads. If they're around, they're probably
			hiding out in the desert.
	
					MUDDY
			That's good to know, Officer.
	
	Muddy takes off with a smile and turns off onto a side road.
	
	
	EXT.  DESERT - LATER
	
	B&B barely crawling forward. Butt-Head stops, then Beavis. They're 
	barely able to talk.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey Butt-Head, are we gonna die?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, probably, huh huh...Whoa, I think my
			life is like, flashing in front of my
			eyes!
	
	BUTT-HEAD'S VISION. Through time-lapse dissolves we see him 
	sitting on his couch with Beavis, laughing like an idiot in the 
	exact same positions at age 2, 5, 7, 10, 13.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, my life is cool!
	
	TIGHT ON BEAVIS:
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh... I think I'm seeing something too.
			It's like a really long time ago...
	
	BEAVIS' VISION: Beavis as a sperm cell swimming through a uterus. 
	It's a sperm cell with the face of Beavis on it.
	
					BEAVIS/SPERM
			Yeah, heh heh. This is gonna be cool.
	
	Beavis/Sperm swims over to the egg.
	
	With its own tail the Beavis/Sperm starts picking its nose.
	
					BEAVIS/SPERM (CONT.)
			Hey, how's it goin'? Heh heh heh.
	
	Several other sperm charge in, knocking Beavis into the egg. His 
	conception looks like a dumb accident.
	
	BACK ON BEAVIS:
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, heh heh I scored.
	
	Animated bubbles appear around Beavis' head.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			Hey Butt-Head, I'm starting to feel weird.
			I think I'm freaking out.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh? Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like,
			everything looks all weird and...
	
	BEAVIS' P.O.V. OF BUTT-HEAD: His face starts to warp and colors 
	start shifting.
	
					BEAVIS (CONT.)
			...and... Whoa!...and it's like there's
			all these weird shapes and it's sort of
			like,...it's like...like a MUSIC VIDEO!!!
	
	Tight on Beavis' face staring in wonder.
	
	THIS IS WHERE THE MUSIC VIDEO/HALLUCINATION SEQUENCE BEGINS. It 
	could even be so shameless as to actually have a chyron in the 
	lower left hand corner.
	
	I would like to have a band (White Zombie?) do a version of 
	something like, "Fire," by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown. This 
	is the song that begins, "I am God of Hellfire and I bring you... 
	fire!"
	
	The concept of this will depend somewhat on which band we get, but 
	I would like to see it get pretty wild and surreal. (If it's White 
	Zombie, we could incorporate some of Rob Zombie's artwork.)
	
	BEAVIS' P.O.V.:
	
	We see the sun above the horizon turn into a giant ball of fire. 
	The ball of fire develops a face and speaks.
	
					FIRE
			I am God of Hellfire and I bring
			you...(music begins) Fire...
	
					BEAVIS
			Whoa!!! This kicks ass!!!
	
	THIS IS THE GREATEST VIDEO BEAVIS HAS EVER SEEN. Out of the ball 
	of fire steps a beautiful woman in a bikini.
	
	At first the video is mostly the God of Hellfire, chicks in 
	bikinis and various images of B&B's TV in all its glory.
	
	As the video/hallucination continues, it becomes a psychotic mass 
	of naked people, fire, TVs, vultures, B&B head-banging, weird 
	stuff from my high school notebooks, etc.
	
	At one point we see the God of Hellfire in a Burger World uniform.
	
	As the song winds down, we incorporate Muddy's car into the 
	surreal imagery. (We should also incorporate their TV, as well as 
	maybe some of the characters from the show that aren't in the 
	movie.)
	
	Then, we REVEAL Muddy's car actually pulling up to B&B's near-dead 
	bodies.
	
	The SONG ENDS as Muddy tosses water on B&B. REVEAL they were not 
	far from the side of a road all along.
	
					B&B
			Ahhhhghhhhgh!
	
	B&B snap out of it. They rise and find Muddy hovering over them 
	with a shotgun.
	
					BEAVIS
			Aagh! I'm all wet!...(realizing) Oh, cool.
			Heh heh heh. Water.
	
	Muddy aims his shotgun at B&B.
	
					MUDDY
			Ah'm gonna enjoy this. Any last words
			b'fore ah kill ya?
	
	B&B think.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... Huh huh. I have a couple. Butt
			cheeks, huh huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah! Boobs. Heh heh. I just wanna say
			that again. Boobs. Heh heh.
	
					MUDDY
			Ah'm gonna blow you both to hell!
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cool, huh huh. (realizing) Hey Beavis
			that's that dude that's paying us to do
			his wife.
	
					BEAVIS
			Oh yeah. Can you just take us to
			Washington? We're gonna meet her there
			and, you know, heh heh hmmm...
	
					MUDDY
			Washington! That's where she was gonna
			meet up with ya? (realizes) Damn, she's
			goin' all the way!
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Muddy lowers the gun a bit.
	
					MUDDY
			You know, I just might need you after all.
			Aw right, in the trunk. You're gonna help
			me get mah unit back.
	
	Muddy pops it open. B&B climb in. Muddy closes the trunk on them 
	and walks to the front of the car. HOLD ON THE TRUNK.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (O.S.)
			Boy, it sure is hard to score. Huh huh
			huh.
	
	Muddy peels out.

					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	Pumping up the jack, they cause the lid of the trunk to start to 
	bend.
	
	Suddenly, it pops open. B&B are a sweaty mess. They gasp.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			This sucks. Let's get outta here.
	
	They look out. The road behind them races past at 80 mph. Beavis 
	stares dumbly.
	
					BEAVIS
			Uh, you first.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			C'mon, Beavis, just start running really
			fast when you hit the ground. It'll work.
	
					BEAVIS
			Okay. I'll go right after you.
	
	Butt-Head shoves Beavis out of the car.

			Ahhhhghghhghghgh!
	
	Beavis tries to run, but hits the road and flips over and over -

			Do you have T.P.? T.P. for my bunghole?
	
					FLEMMING
			We'll get you whatever you want. (to
			agents) Get that other kid. We might need
			him.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Do you have any oleo? Heh heh.
	
					BORK
					(on a radio)
			This is Bork. We need some T.P. and
			some...(to Flemming) What's he say?
	
	ANGLE BEHIND AGENTS. Butt-Head is brought in by two agents.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, this rules! Can I have a gun too?
			Huh huh huh.
	
	ON BEAVIS. He continues to babble, making the agents nervous.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			You must bow down to the Almighty
			Bunghole. (Beavis) Heh heh, this is cool.
			(Cornholio, chanting) Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to Bork)
			He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna
			have to take him out. Get ready to fire on
			my orders... (on bullhorn) This is your
			last chance. Give us the unit now...
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			(Beavis) Why does everyone wanna see my
			schlong? (Cornholio, chanting) I am the
			one-and-only-almighty-bungholiooo!
	
					FLEMMING
					(to agents)
			OK boys. Get ready to fire on the count of
			three. (on bullhorn) I'm gonna give you
			three seconds...
	
	ANGLE ON AGENTS taking aim, cocking their guns.
	
					FLEMMING (CONT.)
					(on bullhorn)
			One...
	
	ANGLE ON BEAVIS, chanting.
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			Cornholio-o-o-o-o...
	
	ANGLE ON BUTT-HEAD.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, huh huh huh.
	
					FLEMMING
					(on bullhorn)
			...Two...
	
					BEAVIS/CORNHOLIO
			...o-o-o-eieee-ooooeeeooooo...
	
					FLEMMING
					(on bullhorn)
			Thrr...
	
	Suddenly Tom Anderson throws open his camper door, holding Beavis' 
	pants.
	
					TOM
			And take yer damn pants with ya...!
			(noticing) What in the hell...?
	
					BORK
					(pointing)
			THE PANTS!!! He's got the unit!
	
	Suddenly all guns are on Anderson.
	
					FLEMMING
					(through bullhorn)
			Drop the pants! Now!
	
					TOM
			Wait a minute. I ain't the one...
	
	IN SLOW MOTION:
	
	A S.W.A.T. TEAM GUY lunges at Tom, grabbing the pants.
	
	Tom pulls away, causing the pants to RIP. THE UNIT GOES FLYING.
	
	A FROZEN MOMENT. SLOW MOTION.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
	
	TIGHT ON FACES IN THE CROWD.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT.
	
	TIGHT ON FLEMMING.
	
	TIGHT ON BUTT-HEAD, LAUGHING IN SLOW MOTION - OBLIVIOUS.
	
	TIGHT ON THE UNIT, FALLING, FALLING.
	
	IT HITS BUTT-HEAD'S HEAD, BOUNCES AND FALLS INTO HIS HANDS.
	
	The agents all stare at Butt-Head - quiet, not sure what to do.
	
	Butt-Head hands it to Flemming, nonchalant.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, here ya go. Huh huh huh.
	
	The crowd CHEERS.
	
	ON ANDERSON'S CAMPER.
	
	Tom is handcuffed roughly.
	
					TOM
			Now wait just a minute...
	
	An agent comes out of the camper with the picture of Dallas. Bork 
	grabs it and shows it to Tom.
	
					BORK
			How do you explain this?
	
	Flemming approaches Tom.
	
					FLEMMING
			Sooo, using two innocent teenagers as
			pawns in your sick game, huh?
	
					TOM
			I don't know what the hell...
	
					FLEMMING
					(disgusted)
			Take him away.
	
	Anderson is dragged away past a group of young, boy-scout types 
	who shake their heads in shame.
	
	ANGLE ON Beavis and Butt-head being interviewed by a reporter. 
	Beavis is in his underwear. Tom is being dragged away in the 
	background.
	
					BEAVIS
			I always thought there was something wrong
			with him. Heh heh heh.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Yeah, he had a lot of problems. Huh huh
			huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
					(leaning towards camera)
			Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	DISSOLVE TO:
	
	
	EXT.  WHITE HOUSE - DAY
	
	Later. Establish. Most A.T.F. cars are pulling out.
	
	
	INT.  WHITE HOUSE/OVAL OFFICE - DAY
	
	B&B sit as Flemming paces in front of them. Beavis is no longer 
	Cornholio.
	
					FLEMMING
			I gotta admit, I didn't believe it. I
			thought you were scum. But you saved more
			lives today than you'll ever know. You led
			us to one of the sickest criminals in our
			history. This country owes you a debt.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, does that mean, like, we're gonna get
			money and stuff?
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, and chicks! We were supposed to
			score.
	
					FLEMMING
			For security reasons, your actions will
			have to remain top secret. But someone
			very special wants to give his thanks.
	
	Flemming motions to the big chair. The PRESIDENT swivels around 
	and rises to shake hands with B&B.
	
					PRESIDENT
			Beavis and Butt-Head. On behalf of all
			your fellow Americans, I extend my deepest
			thanks. You exemplify a fine new crop of
			young Americans who will grow into the
			leaders of this great country.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Huh huh huh. He said crap. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. This guy's cool.
	
					PRESIDENT
			In recognition for your great service, I'm
			appointing you honorary agents in the
			Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Whoa, huh huh!!!
	
	The President hands them citations.
	
					BUTT-HEAD (CONT.)
			You hear that, Beavis! We're gonna get
			alcohol, tobacco and guns!
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah, maybe some chicks too. Heh heh.
	
	B&B leave the office, muttering.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Cigarettes and beer rule! Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Yeah! We're with the bureau of cigarettes
			and chicks! We're gonna score!
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh huh huh.
	
	
	EXT.  AIRPORT NEAR B&B'S HOMETOWN - DAY
	
	A plane lands.
	
	
	INT.  PLANE/DOOR - DAY
	
	As before, the flight crew stares in horror and silence as B&B 
	deplane.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... bye-bye.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh heh. Bye bye. Heh heh.
	
	
	EXT.  ELITE MOTEL LODGE BAR - DAY
	
	Walking home, B&B pass the motel. They notice the sign for big 
	screen TV. They stop and look at it.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			You know what else sucks? We never even
			got a TV.
	
	ON BEAVIS, seeing something, amazed, ecstatic.
	
					BEAVIS
			Heh mmm, hey mmm Butt-Head! Look!
	
	Heavenly MUSIC. B&B stare at the wonder before them.
	
	ANGLE ON THEIR TV, mangled, partly-crushed junk.
	
					B&B
			Yes! Yes! Yes! Huh huh huh.
	
	B&B run up to the set like it was their lost and found dog.
	
	
	EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
	
	B&B walk off into the distance with the TV.
	
					BEAVIS
			Hey Butt-Head, do you think we're ever
			gonna score?
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh, I probably will, but not you. You're
			too much of a butt-monkey. Huh huh.
	
					BEAVIS
			Shut up, dill-hole.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Butt-dumpling...
	
					BEAVIS
			Turd-burglar...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Dill-wad...
	
					BEAVIS
			Bunghole...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Butt-snatch...
	
					BEAVIS
			Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... dill, um, face...
	
					BEAVIS
			Um... ass... head...
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Uh... butt-snatch...
	
					BEAVIS
			You already said that, Butt-Head.
	
					BUTT-HEAD
			Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
	
					B&B
			Huh huh huh...
	
	B&B head off into the sunset, trading lame insults as we FADE OUT.
