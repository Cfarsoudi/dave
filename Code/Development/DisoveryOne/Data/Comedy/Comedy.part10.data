          EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

          BEN STONE, 23, cute in a chunky Jewish guy sort of way, boxes one
          of his roommates, MARTIN. His other roommates, JAY and JASON fight
          with broom sticks. JONAH drinks beer on the couch spectating.

                         QUICK IMAGES:

           We see Ben and Jay fighting. At one point they fight with gloves
          which are on fire, balancing on a plank over a dirty pool.
           Ben now has a fishbowl filled with weed smoke over his head.
          There is a smoking joint in his mouth, making the bowl get
          cloudier and cloudier. He starts coughing hysterically and takes
          it off.

           A boom box is playing. The boys are now free style rapping. It
          is terrible but they are having a blast. Pot is being smoked.
          Beer is around.

                         

          EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - A DIFFERENT DAY

           Oh, I would, but I'm supposed to work
           out.

                          DEBBIE

           can't cancel now, he'll charge me.

                          DEBBIE
           Well, you didn't tell me.

                          PETE
           Yeah I did. Last week, I told you.

                          DEBBIE
           You didn't tell me.

                          PETE
           I did. And then I wrote it on the
           calendar like you told me to.

                          DEBBIE
           No, you didn't tell me.

                          PETE
           I did tell you.

                          DEBBIE
           Well, you didn't, but what are we
           going to do? Because I have an
           appointment so you're taking the kids
           to school.
          Pete holds Charlotte in front of him.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Don't use the baby to cover your
           tracks.

                          ALISON
           I can drive them. I'll drive them to

           Great. Good. You turned my sister into
           a limo driver.

                          ALISON
           I don't mind.

                          PETE

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)

          INT. ALLISON'S CAR - DAY

          Alison drives the kids to school. Charlotte and Sadie sit in the
          back. Charlotte GIGGLES.

                          ALISON
           What are you giggling about?

                          SADIE

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)
           Be quiet. You're starting to annoy me.

                          SADIE
           You know what I did the other day?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          SADIE
           I Googled "murder."

                          ALISON
           You Googled "murder?"

                          SADIE
           Yeah.

                          ALISON
           Why? I mean what did it say?

                          SADIE
           It didn't say anything. It just showed
           pictures of people lying dead on the
           floor and...blood everywhere and
           ugh...

                          ALISON
           That was just ketchup.

                          (BEAT)
           Who wants to hear some music?

                          SADIE
           I want to hear "Rent."

                          CHARLOTTE
           I want to hear Green Day!

                          SADIE

                          CHARLOTTE
           Well, I want to listen to Green Day.

                          SADIE
           Well, I got your baby!

           KNOCKED UP - 4.

                         
          Charlotte WHINES.

                          ALISON
           Don't taunt her. Come on.

                          SADIE
           Here.
          Sadie shoves the doll at Charlotte.

                          ALISON
           Sadie!

                          CHARLOTTE

                          ALISON
           Why did you just do that? Don't throw
           things at your sister!

                          CHARLOTTE
           She hit me.

                          ALISON
           Did you hit her?

                          SADIE
           I did not.

                          ALISON
           Make her happy.

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)
           It's okay.

                          SADIE
           It won't make her happy. She spilled
           all the marbles on the floor.

                          ALISON
           Well, give her her marbles back.

                         

          INT. BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

          In a living room of the house the guys have created an office for
          their web site. There are a few large tables, several computers
          which they work at, and a few TV sets which have movies running on
          them. Ben and his friends are holding a meeting. They each have a
          note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer. They smoke a joint
          and drink beers.

                          JASON
           All right? Now, are you sure you
           understand the terms of the bet?
           `Cause this is serious.

                          MARTIN
           Oh, no.

           KNOCKED UP - 5.

                         

                          JASON
          Martin, listen. You don't shave your
          beard or cut your hair for one year,
          and if you can do that, I will pay
          your rent. But if you shave, then you
          have to pay all five of our rents.

                          MARTIN
          Thanks for the free money, bitch.

                          JONAH
          Hey, Martin, was it weird when you
          joined the Taliban, being American and
          everything like that? Like when you
          see a woman driving a car, do you just
          get pissed?

                          JASON
          Just watch your back, Serpico. You
          never know who your friends are.

                          MARTIN
          You guy can't make fun of the me the
          whole time.

                          JASON
          But, Martin, it's a competition. It's
          called "The Dirty Man Competition."
          We're gonna make fun of you until you
          shave the beard. That's the rules.

                          JAY
          That's the whole point. You're
          supposed to be tempted into shaving.

                          BEN
          Your face looks like Robin Williams'
          knuckles.

                          MARTIN
          You guys aren't allowed to make fun of
          me. It's not part of the rules.

                          JASON
          Martin, why didn't you just listen to
          me when I was explaining the rules?
          You just looked at me with that blank
          stare of yours. It was like talking to
          a wax statue.

                          BEN
          Okay, guys, are you ready? So... "Only
          at `Flesh of the Stars.com' will
          customers be able to find exactly how
          long into what movies their favorite
          stars are exposed."

                          JASON
          Nice.

                          JAY
          Oh, fuckin' booya.

                          BEN
          Pretty good, right?

           KNOCKED UP - 6.

                         

                          JONAH
           Yeah.

                          JASON
           Yeah, ka-ching. Ka-ching. Ka-ching.

                          JONAH
           Guys, let's start loggin', all right?
           Charles Manson? Do you have any other
           thoughts?

                          MARTIN
           Good, awesome, let's start this off
           with a bang. Jamie Lee Curtis. I got
           an hour and ten minutes in "Trading
           Places." Uh, both chesticles.

                          JAY
           Ah, I got something. A three-titted
           alien from "Total Recall?"

                          JONAH
           Aw, she's not famous.

                          RYAN SEACREST
           So if you want that perfect tan like
           the stars, he's the one to see. We'll
           be right back on "E! News." Stay with

           Okay.

                          RYAN SEACREST
           Okay, is Jessica Simpson here yet?

                          ALISON
           Let me check.

                          RYAN SEACREST
           Is she on her way?

                          ALISON
           Hey, guys?

                          RYAN SEACREST
           She's left her house?

           (into her headset)
           Okay, let me know when she's pulling
           in.

                          (TO RYAN)
          She's about to pull in.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          Is she camera-ready?

                          ALISON
           (into her headset)
          Is she camera-ready?

                          RYAN SEACREST
          If she's going to be in hair and
          makeup for three hours. I can't do it.
          I'm not going to be here. I got to do
          "American Idol." It's live. I got to
          do it. I got to be there. What are we
          going to interview her about?

                          ALISON
          Nothing personal.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          No personal questions.

                          ALISON
          No personal questions. Don't ask her
          about her sister and her nose job.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          No plastic surgery questions.

                          ALISON
          She doesn't want to talk about her
          boobs or her father's comments about
          her boobs.

                          RYAN SEACREST
          Great. We'll talk about the Middle
          East and maybe an idea of an exit
          strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch.
          Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe
          have her point it out to us on a
          globe? I don't understand the young
          talent in this town! It doesn't make
          any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm
          more famous than half the people we
          talk to anyway! No one stands up. No
          one has the balls to sit them down and
          say, "Look, just cut the shit."But
          everybody works for `em. They're all
          on the payroll. They're all sucking
          the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-
          eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the
          shit." And all these stars just to
          fuck it up. That's what they do. They
          fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!
          And now I'm sweating.

                          ALISON
          You know what? You want us to just
          come and get you when she gets here?
          You want to head to the green room for
          a minute? Just chill out?

                          RYAN SEACREST
          That's a good idea.

           Okay, we'll get you a cookie.

           I'm sorry I'm pissy.
          JILL, one of the E! executives, approaches Alison.

                          JILL
           Alison?

                          ALISON
           Yeah?

                          JILL
           Jack and I need to see you in his
           office.

                         

          INT. JACK'S OFFICE, E! ENTERTAINMENT - DAY

          Allison's boss, JACK, early forties, is at his desk. Alison and
          Jill sit in the office.

                          JACK
           Thanks for coming in, Alison. Well, we
           wanted to talk to you today because we
           had a little debate on the conference
           call with New York about you.

                          ALISON
           You were talking about me?

                          JACK
           We were wondering aloud to one another
           whether or not you would be good for
           on-camera.

                          ALISON
           What'd you decide?

                          JILL
           They decided that they like you. And
           they would like to put you on camera.

                          ALISON
           Really?

                          JILL
           I know. I was so surprised, too.

           KNOCKED UP - 9.

                         

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God. This is the best news
          ever. Thank you so much. This is
          great!

                          JACK
          Congratulations.

                          ALISON
          Thank you.

                          JACK
          I'll take that smile as a "Yes, I'll
          do it."

                          ALISON
          Absolutely. I'm so excited. Oh, my
          God.

                          JILL
          It's a lot of work. Can't wait to see
          what happens. It's going to be tough.
          Tough job.

                          JACK
          About the work, most immediately,
          there's going to be some things that
          you're going to be able to get that
          other people in the office don't get.
          One of them: Gym membership.

                          ALISON
          You want me to lose weight?

                          JACK
          I don't want you to lose weight.

                          JILL
          We can't legally ask you to do that.

                          JACK
          We didn't say lose weight.

                          JILL
          No.

                          JACK
          I might say "tighten."

                          ALISON
          "Tight."

                          JACK
          A little...tighter?

                          JILL
          Just like toned and smaller.

                          JACK
          Don't make everything smaller. I don't
          want to generalize that way. Tighter.

                          JILL
          We don't want you to lose weight. We
          just want you to be healthy.

           KNOCKED UP - 10.

                         

                          ALISON
           Okay.

                          JILL
           You know, by, by eating less. We would
           just like it if you...go home and step
           on the scale and write down how much
           you weigh and subtract it by, like,
           twenty.

                          ALISON
           Twenty.

                          JILL
           And then weigh that much.

                          JACK
           Just remember, you've got it here,
           you've got it here, and everybody's
           going see you right there.

                         

          INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison hug. Pete is on the couch wearing headphones.

           Yay! That's so exciting!

                          ALISON
           Yay!

                          DEBBIE
           Oh my god!

                          (TO PETE)
           Hey!

                          PETE
           Huh?

                          ALISON
           I got a promotion.

                          PETE
           Oh, congratulations!

                          ALISON
           Thank you.

                          PETE
           Hey, maybe you can get your own place
           now.

                          ALISON
           Oh, let's not get ahead of ourselves.
           Yay!

                          DEBBIE
           Let's go celebrate.

                          ALISON
           Okay, let's do it.

           KNOCKED UP - 11.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Pete'll watch the kids?

                          PETE
           Yeah! We can watch "Taxicab
           Confessions."

                          DEBBIE
           What are you going to do?

                          ALISON
           I don't know!
          Debbie and Alison SHRIEK.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm so excited.

                          ALISON
           Yay!

                         

          INT. CAR - NIGHT

          Alison and Debbie drive to a nightclub.

                          DEBBIE
           I walked in on him masturbating one
           night.

                          ALISON
           Ooh! Did you get the deer-in-the-
           headlights look? Did he freeze or did
           he finish?

                          DEBBIE
           No, he tried to pretend like he wasn't
           doing anything under the covers.

                          ALISON
           Oh, no!

                          DEBBIE
           I buy these nice towels and he whacks
           off into them.

                          ALISON
           "Deb and Pete forever"

                          DEBBIE
           And once he does that into them once,
           they're never soft ever again.

                         

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Alison and Debbie are walking over.

                          DEBBIE
           I can always tell if I'm looking good
           based on whether or not we get in.
          They reach the front. The Bouncer looks at them and waves them
          in.

           KNOCKED UP - 12.

                         

                          BOUNCER
           Ladies?

                          ALISON
           Guess we're looking good.

                          DEBBIE
           If I didn't get in, I would have lost
           my shit.
          Ben and the guys are standing at the head of the line.

                          BEN
           What's going on man? How long you
           gonna make us wait out here, for
           Christ's sake?

                          JAY
           Come on! What the fuck!

                         

          INT. NIGHTCLUB

          Ben sits with his friends, Jason, Jonah, Jay, and Martin.

                          BEN
           You know what movie I just saw again
           the other day which is fucking, like,
           mind-blowing, and I haven't seen it
           since it came out? "Munich."

                          JAY
           "Munich!"

                          JONAH
           Dude, "Munich" fuckin' rules.

                          JAY
           "Munich" is awesome!

                          BEN
           That movie was Eric Bana kicking
           fuckin' ass!
          They all agree.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Dude, every movie with Jews, we're the
           ones getting killed. "Munich" flips it
           on its ear. We cappin' motherfuckers.

                          JONAH
           Not only killing, but fuckin', like,
           takin' names.

                          BEN
           If any of us get laid tonight, it's
           because of Eric Bana in "Munich."

                          JONAH
           I agree with that.

                          JAY
           I agree.

           KNOCKED UP - 13.

                         

                          BEN
           You know what is not helping us get
           laid? Is the shoe bomber, Richard
           Reid, over here at our table. I like
           your shoes.

                          JONAH
           How was "Burning Man" this year?

                          BEN
           Fuck you guys, I'm glad I'm not
           Jewish.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           So are we.

                          MARTIN
           Fine. Screw it.

                          BEN
           You weren't "chosen" for a reason.

                          JAY
           Yeah. Ahh!

                          JASON
           Ohh!!!
          Meanwhile, Debbie and Alison head for the bar.

                          DEBBIE
           It's like everyone in here is twelve
           years old.
          Debbie SIGHS.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           Am I too old to be here?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          DEBBIE
           Am I too old to be here?

                          ALISON
           No, of course not.

                          DEBBIE
           Does it look weird that I'm here?

                          ALISON
           No, not at all.

                          DEBBIE
           Am I hotter than these little bitches?

                          ALISON
           Yes! You look amazing.

                          DEBBIE
           Guys in here would fuck me, right?

           KNOCKED UP - 14.

                         

                          ALISON
           Yes.

                          DEBBIE
           That's weird to say, but, it makes me
           feel better.

                          ALISON
           You look hot.

                          DEBBIE
           I believe you.

                          ALISON
           I'm getting us drinks.
          Alison leaves for the bar.

                         

          INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          Ben is already at the bar attempting to get the BARTENDER's
          attention.

                          BEN
           Yo, a beer over here, please? You're
           gonna be embarrassed when you realize
           I'm Wilmer Valderrama. God.

                          ALISON
           (to the Bartender)
           Oh, Hey! Excuse me!

                          BEN
           He's literally ignoring this entire
           half of the bar. Don't even bother.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, awesome.

                          BEN
           A beer over here, please? He looked at
           us! Did you see that?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, that was rough.

                          BEN
           And if you can't get service, what am
           I gonna do, you know?

          money on the bar.
           BEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           There you go.

           Thank you.

           Okay, enjoy it.

           Are you sure?

                          BEN
           I'm sure. I tried that once before at
           The Comedy Store and I got punched in
           the ear.

                          ALISON
           Thanks a lot, Oh, fuck, fuck! I'm
           supposed to get one for my sister.

                          BEN
           Oh, here, take mine.
          Ben hands Alison his beer.

           Please, I very rarely look cool. This
           is a big moment for me. Just take it.

                          ALISON

           What's up, daddy?

                          BEN
           That girl. She, she totally gave me an
           opening, man, and I locked up. I just
           want to get shit-faced, though, you
           know? I'll just jerk it later. It's
           cool.

                          JASON
           Are you fuckin' crazy, man? She
           looks...smart. Who's that she's
           sitting with?

                          BEN
           It's her sister.

           Her sister?

                          BEN

           Why?

           Hey, Crockett. You still partyin' with

           Come on, man. I'm getting it from all

                          JONAH
           I know, I don't either. Was it weird
           when you changed your name from Cat
           Stevens to Yusuf Islam?

                          MARTIN
           Yeah, it was really awkward.

                          JONAH
           All right, man. I got to take off. See
           ya, "Scorsese on coke."
          Jay GROWLS loudly.

           She's married.

                          (TO ALISON)
           Why do you have to say that?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          JASON
           It's a shame. You're beautiful.

                          DEBBIE
           Thank you.

                          ALISON
           She has two kids, too.

                          DEBBIE
           Shut up!

                          ALISON
           What? It's nothing to be ashamed of.

                          BEN
           You think that's gonna stop him from
           hitting on her? It's not, at all.

                          JASON
           I love kids.

                          DEBBIE
           Really?

           Hello?

           Cool phone.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, she's got a really cool phone.

                          DEBBIE
           (into the phone)
           What? Is it a rash or is it the
           chicken pox? I don't know! Google it.
           Okay. All right, bye.
           (to Alison et al)
           I got to go. Sadie might have the
           chicken pox.

                          JASON
           I had the chicken pox three times. I
           have no immunity to it.

                          BEN
           We don't have the heart to tell him
           it's herpes.

                          JASON
           It's not herpes if it's everywhere.

                          DEBBIE

           Um, uh, you know, I'm all dressed, so
           I'll just hang out.

                          DEBBIE
           Really?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, I'll take a cab home.

                          DEBBIE
           Be safe.

                          ALISON

           Ben and Alison dance, clearly pretty drunk now. We see Ben's
          friends in the background, also dancing. Ben pretends to throw
          dice while dancing.

           Dude, I think he's doing the dice

           That's really all he's got.
           Alison and Ben take another shot. Alison runs her fingers through

           You're prettier than I am.
          They continue to make out.

           Do you have a condom?

          Ben throws the condom on the floor and rolls over onto Alison.

                          BEN
           Really?

                          ALISON
           Do you need to get to work or
           anything?

                          BEN
           No work today. Do you want to get
           breakfast?

                          ALISON
           Okay.

           KNOCKED UP - 24.

                         

          EXT. GUEST HOUSE - MORNING

          Alison and Ben walk to their cars. Suddenly Pete walks out of the
          house with the kids.

                          ALISON
           `Morning.

                          PETE
           Good morning Alison.

                          BEN
           I'm Ben. What's happenin', man?

                          PETE
           Ben.

                          BEN
           How's it goin'?
          Pete shakes Ben's hand and smiles.

                          PETE

                          (PLAYFULLY)
           Ah, to be young.

                          ALISON
           Stop it.

                          PETE
           You stop it.

                          ALISON
           See ya later.

                          BEN
           All righty.

                          PETE
           See ya later. Enjoy the day.

                          (TO CHARLOTTE)
           Never do what they did.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I'm gonna do it.

                          PETE
           You are? Uh-oh. Someone's getting home-
           schooled.

                         

          INT. DINER - DAY

          Alison is in the booth. Ben emerges from the bathroom.

                          BEN
           Whew. I just yacked, something nasty.
           I feel way better, though. I think
           that's the secret. You just gotta
           puke. Did you puke?

                          ALISON
           No.

           KNOCKED UP - 25.

                         

                          BEN
          You can. I won't think it's gross or
          anything.

                          ALISON
          I'm fine.

                          BEN
          Oh, okay.

                          ALISON
          I just need some coffee, so...

                          BEN
          You know, the best thing for a
          hangover's weed. Do you smoke? Do you
          smoke weed?

                          ALISON
          Not really.

                          BEN
          You don't?

                          ALISON
          No.

                          BEN
          At all?

                          ALISON
          Mm-mm.

                          BEN
          Like in the morning?

                          ALISON
          No, I just don't.

                          BEN
          It's the best medicine. `Cause it
          fixes everything. Jonah broke his
          elbow once. We just got high and, it
          still clicks, but, I mean, he's okay.

                          ALISON
          Right.

                          BEN
          Yeah. Last night was great...what I
          remember of it?

                          ALISON
          Right, yeah.

                          BEN
          Yeah.

                          ALISON
          We had a great time.

                          BEN
          Yeah. So what do you do?

           KNOCKED UP - 26.

                         

                          ALISON
          I work at E!

                          BEN
          The television channel?

                          ALISON
          Uh-huh, remember?

                          BEN
          Wow.

                          ALISON
          We had, we had this conversation last
          night. I, I told you about my
          promotion and I was out celebrating
          it. No?

                          BEN
          I don't remember that at all.

                          ALISON
          I'm super excited about it. I'm
          actually doing my first on-air
          interview today.

                          BEN
          With who?

                          ALISON
          Matthew Fox.

                          BEN
          Matthew Fox from "Lost?"

                          ALISON
          Yeah.

                          BEN
          You know what's interesting about him?

                          ALISON
          What?

                          BEN
          Nothing. Will you tell him he's an
          asshole for me?

                          ALISON
          No.

                          BEN
          Someone needs to. Like who gives a
          shit?

                          ALISON
          I hope a lot of people actually
          because that's what my job entails, is
          making sure people care about what he
          has to say. I'm interviewing him.

                          BEN
          Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't
          give a shit. I'm just saying he
          deserves a beat down.

           KNOCKED UP - 27.

                         

                          ALISON
          It's sort of embarrassing to ask at
          this point, but what do you do for
          work?

                          BEN
          Me and my roommates have
          started...we're starting an Internet
          website.

                          ALISON
          Oh, cool, what is it?

                          BEN
          I'll give you the virtual experience
          okay? How's that? You're at your
          computer. Who's an actress you like?

                          ALISON
          Mary Tyler Moore?

                          BEN
          No, that does not work at all. Let's
          say you love Meg Ryan.

                          ALISON
          I do.

                          BEN
          Great. Who doesn't? Let's say you like
          her so much, you want to know every
          movie where she shows her tits. And
          not just that, but how long into that
          movie she shows her tits. Come to our
          web page, exclusively, type in `Meg
          Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight
          minutes in, forty-eight minutes in,
          like an hour and ten minutes in. She's
          like naked that whole fuckin' movie.
          She does full-frontal in that movie.

                          ALISON

                          (DISGUSTED)
          Wow.

                          BEN
          They should have called her Harry, not
          Sally.

                          ALISON
          Really.

                          BEN
          I'll show it to you. I'll show you Meg
          Ryan's bush.

                          ALISON

                          (EXASPERATED)
          Okay.

                          BEN
          Cool.

                          ALISON
          I actually need to get going, so.

           KNOCKED UP - 28.

                         

                          BEN
           Awesome. Can I get your number?
          Alison is incredulous.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           We had fun, right? We should hook up
           again.

                          ALISON
           I'm gonna give you my card because
           that'll be the best way...

                          BEN
           If you want to contact me, I don't
           have a cell right now because of
           payment complications, but you can
           email me at the web page, I check it.
           It's Ben at flesh of the stars, one
           word, dot com.
          Alison gets out of the booth. Ben gets up too.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           So, awesome.

                          ALISON
           All right then. Nice to meet you.
          Ben puts his arms out for a hug. Alison complies. Ben kisses the
          air.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           Take care.

                          BEN
           Okay, uh, see ya.
          Alison exits the diner.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Bye!

                          (TO HIMSELF)
           That was fuckin' brutal. Yeah, that
           was brutal.

          INT. E ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

          Alison is standing on stage with JAMES FRANCO.

                          ALISON
           Hi, I'm Alison Scott and we're here
           today with James Franco from "Spider
           Man."

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           How are you?

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Great.

           KNOCKED UP - 29.

                         

                          ALISON
           Thanks for coming.

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Of course.

                          ALISON
           Tell me, were you a big fan...
          Alison GULPS and appears uncomfortable.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           ...I'm sorry, let me take that again.

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Tell me, were you a big fan of the
           comic books growing up?

                          JAMES FRANCO
           No, actually, I didn't read any of the
           comic books until I got the movie.
          Alison stares at the floor looking ill. She breathes heavily.
           JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)
           Are you okay?

                          ALISON
           Uh-huh. Yeah, just, what about the
           comic books? Keep talking.

                          JAMES FRANCO
           Like I said I really wasn't into them,
           but now that I did the research, I
           think they're pretty amazing.
          Alison runs offstage and VOMITS into a trash can. Repeatedly.
           JAMES FRANCO (cont'd)
           What the fuck?
          Alison continues to puke.

                         

          INT. EDITING BAY

          Alison and her editor, BRENT, are watching the Franco/puking
          clips.

                          BRENT
           Is that the sound of you puking?

           JAMES FRANCO (ON TV MONITOR)
           If this is one of those fuckin' joke
           shows, I'm not into it.

                          BRENT
           We should put this on YouTube.

                          ALISON
           Shut up.

           KNOCKED UP - 30.

                         

                          BRENT
           This is hilarious.

                          ALISON
           You're an asshole.

                          BRENT
           Look how sweaty you are. You look like
           Dom DeLuise.

                          ALISON
           I don't need to see it again. It's
           gonna make me throw up.

                          BRENT
           You look like Jabba the Hutt dying.
          Brent HISSES like Jabba the Hutt.

                          ALISON
           You're such an asshole.

                          BRENT
           I'm just jerking your chain. I'll fix
           this. No problem.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, maybe if you can just edit this
           out and we can re--
          Alison swallows hard.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           --we can reshoot my questions.
          Alison looks ill again.

                          BRENT
           What's up?
          Alison is frantically looking for a place to vomit.
           BRENT (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Whoa, whoa, whoa, no, no, no. Over
           here. Not on the mixing board, not on
           the mixing board.
          Alison finds the trash and VOMITS.

                          BRENT (CONT'D)
           Are you okay?

                          ALISON
           Oh my god. Oh my god.

                          BRENT
           Are you sick?

                          ALISON
           I don't know.

                          BRENT
           What'd you eat?

           KNOCKED UP - 31.

                         

                          ALISON
           I haven't eaten today yet.

                          BRENT
           You haven't eaten yet?

                          ALISON
           Do you have a napkin or something?
          Brent grabs a stray piece of paper.

                          BRENT
           Here, here. What do you have, like the
           flu?

                          ALISON
           I don't know.

                          BRENT
           God, I hope you're not pregnant.

                          ALISON
           It's impossible. You have to have sex
           to get pregnant.
          Alison reacts with a sad realization. Brent picks up the phone.

                          BRENT
           (into the phone)
           B.K. It's Brent Master Five. Alison
           just puked. Dude, that's what I said.
           She's probably pregnant, right?

                          ALISON
           Oh, shit.

                          BRENT
           (into the phone)
           How does she look right now? She looks
           like she just realized that she's
           pregnant.

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison are sitting on the bed.

                          ALISON
           No, I can't be pregnant. Right? That
           was what, eight weeks ago?

                          DEBBIE
           Did you miss your period?

                          ALISON
           No. Wait. I don't know. Shit. I don't
           know. I can't remember. I was, I mean,
           I've been really stressed at work. I
           can't remember my last period.

                          DEBBIE
           Are you the lady who doesn't realize
           she's pregnant until she's sitting on
           the toilet and a kid pops out?

           KNOCKED UP - 32.

                         

                          ALISON
           Can you not joke right now? Don't joke
           right now. This is really serious.

                          DEBBIE
           Did I meet him?

                          ALISON
           Yeah. You know, he was kind of like
           medium height, sort of...chubby.
           Blonde, curly hair. Remember?

                          DEBBIE
           With the man boobs.

                          ALISON
           Yes! Here, I have this thing of him on
           my phone.
          Alison takes out her phone to play a video.

           BEN (ON PHONE VIDEO)
           Hey! I live in your phone! This is the
           best night of my life! I gotta pee.

                          DEBBIE
           Oh god. How did this happen?

                          ALISON
           Oh, shit.

                          DEBBIE
           Well there's only one way to find out.

                         

          INT. DRUG STORE

          Alison and Debbie run down the aisles looking for pregnancy tests.

                          DEBBIE
           They're here! Here they are! Over
           here!
          Every test on the shelf is pulled into their basket.

                          ALISON
           Okay. "Positive Choice."

                          DEBBIE
           "Easy, One, Two, Three."
          They run toward the check out counter.

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          They dump all the tests on the floor. Alison sits on the toilet
          and rips one test open. She puts the applicator between her legs.

                          ALISON
           Here. Hurry up now. Come on.
          The test reads positive.

           KNOCKED UP - 33.

                         

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           Get more! Get me a few more!

                          DEBBIE
           Did you try the "Ova-Sure?"
          Alison furiously drinks some juice.

                          ALISON
           I'm dripping, I'm dripping. Wait.
          They check another test.

                          DEBBIE
           Good! A smiley face! Oh, I think
           that's bad.

                          ALISON
           How long does this one take?

                          DEBBIE
           These can't all be positive. Let me
           try one.
          Pete enters to see Debbie sitting on the toilet. Debbie urinates
          on the test and checks it.

                          ALISON
           God, you really had to pee.
          Debbie picks up a test. It's positive.

                          DEBBIE
           What is this? What the hell is this?

                          ALISON
           I think you picked up the wrong one.

                          DEBBIE
           Fuck. That scared me. That would suck.
          Alison glares at Debbie.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           I'm sorry. That scared me.

                         

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, POOL - NIGHT

          Alison is on a chaise lounge. Debbie is sitting nearby.

                          ALISON
           It's gonna be fine. Right?
          Debbie contemplates.
           ALISON (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Right?

                          DEBBIE
           Of course it will be fine. It's gonna
           be fine.

           KNOCKED UP - 34.

                         

                          ALISON
           Shit.

                          DEBBIE
           You just need to call him.

                          ALISON
           Maybe I don't need to call him until
           after I see the doctor.

                          DEBBIE
           You need to call.

                          ALISON
           I don't want to call him. I don't need
           to call him.

                          DEBBIE
           You should call.

                          ALISON
           I can't call him anyway. He doesn't
           even have a phone. He didn't even have
           a number to give me.

                          DEBBIE
           He doesn't have a phone?

                          ALISON
           Said some kind of billing issue.

                          DEBBIE
           He can't afford a phone? Sadie has a
           phone.

                          ALISON
           Shit, you're right. I got to call. I
           don't know. I'm gonna have to look him
           up on his stupid website.

                          DEBBIE
           What kind of website does he have?

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, OFFICE

          Debbie and Alison sit at the computer looking at Flesh Of the
          Stars.

                          DEBBIE
           He spelling "coming" wrong. Oh it's
           "cum." That's gross.

                          ALISON
           Just go to "Contact Us."

                          DEBBIE

           You're sure?

                          ALISON
           Yeah.

           Why not? Meeting of minds sounds good.
           What do you say Geisha House,
           Hollywood, nine o'clock?

                          ALISON
           (into the phone)
           Sure. That's cool. Can we make it more
           like six, though? I'd like to keep it
           early.

                          BEN

          You look very pretty, though.

                          ALISON
          Thanks. Yeah, I just thought, I don't
          know, I thought maybe it'd be cool to
          hang out a little bit and... We didn't
          really get to talk much last time so I

                         THOUGHT--

                          BEN
          That we didn't.

                          ALISON
          I thought maybe we'd just talk and get
          to know each other...better.

                          BEN
          Cool. Okay, I'll start. I'm Canadian.

          From Vancouver. I live here illegally,
          actually. Don't tell anyone. But it
          works out in my advantage, ultimately,
          `cause I don't have to pay any taxes.
          So financially that's helpful `cause I
          don't have a lot of money. I'm not
          poor or anything but I eat a lot of
          spaghetti.

                          ALISON

          that you guys do for fun? Do you have
          a real job?

          It was my foot more than anything.
          But, I got fourteen grand from the
          British Columbia government.

                          ALISON
          Right.

                          BEN
          And that really lasted me until now.
          It's been almost ten years. I have
          like nine hundred bucks left. So that
          should last me for I'm not a
          mathematician, but like another two
          years or some shit...I think.

                          ALISON
          Yeah. So, I have something I really
          need to tell you. It's kind of why I
          called you. Here it goes. I'm
          pregnant.

                          BEN
          Fuck off.

                          ALISON
          What?

                          BEN
          What?

                          ALISON
          I'm pregnant...?

                          BEN
          With emotion?

                          ALISON
          With a baby. You're the father.

                          BEN
          I'm the father.

                          ALISON
          Yes!

                          BEN
          How the fuck could this happen?

                          ALISON
          I don't know. I thought you were
          wearing a condom.

                          BEN
          No.

                          ALISON
          What?

                          BEN
          I wasn't.

          Why not?

                          BEN
          Because you told me not to.

                          ALISON
          What are you talking about?

                          BEN
          What am I talking about? You told me
          not to.

                          ALISON
          I did not tell you not to wear a
          condom.

                          BEN
          Here's what happened, okay? I will
          give you a play-by-play of my memory.
          I almost had the condom on my dick. It
          was on the cusp and then you said,
          "Just do it, already."

                          ALISON
          I didn't mean do it without a condom.
          I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like
          "get fucking going!"

                          BEN
          Well, I assumed you were wearing a
          patch, or like a dental dam or one of
          those fuckin' butterfly clips or
          something like that.

                          ALISON
          What the hell is a dental dam?

                          BEN
          It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting,
          okay? But I thought you had one. Why
          the fuck didn't you stop me once we
          started?

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't
          tell that you didn't have one on!
          Obviously, I was drunk!

                          BEN
          Was your vagina drunk? Did you think
          it's the thinnest condom on earth I
          have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I
          made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed
          out a penis and put it on? What the
          fuck?!

                          ALISON
          You are unbelievable.

                          BEN
          Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've
          reacted unfavorably. So what happens
          now? I don't know how this works.

           with me to the gynecologist.

                          BEN
           So you haven't seen him, though?

           No.

                          BEN
           So you don't know if you're pregnant.

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           So, what can I help you with today,
           Mister and Mrs. Stone?

                          ALISON
           I took a home pregnancy test and it
           said I was pregnant, so here we are.

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           Let's have a look. Legs up.
          Alison puts her legs up and leans back.

                          BEN
           Nice office.

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           Thank you.

           DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)
           Well, you do look a lot like your
           sister.
          Dr. Pellagrino picks up a long cone shaped device.
           DR. PELLAGRINO(cont'd)
           This is gonna be cold.

                          (TO BEN)
           And you're next. I'm just kidding.
          Dr. Pellagrino looks at Ben and shrugs like saying "this is just
          part of the job" as he puts the cone device inside Alison.
           DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           There's the cervix. And the uterus.
           See that? That dark sac there, that's
           the amniotic sac. And right there, in
           the middle is the embryo. Do you see
           that flicker? You know what that is?
           That's the heartbeat. Yeah, it looks
           like you are pregnant. About eight or
           nine weeks, I'd say. Congratulations.
          Alison points to the monitor.

                          ALISON
           That, that's it?

           DR. PELLAGRINO
           Yep. Take good care of it. Now the fun
           part starts. Let me make a picture for
           ya, huh? That'll be fun.
          Alison begins to CRY.
           DR. PELLAGRINO (CONT'D) (cont'd)
           Well, I'll meet ya in my office. I'll

                          JASON
           Why did we go to Costco and buy a
           year's supply of condoms if you
           weren't gonna use `em, man?

                          JONAH
           I can't believe you did this. You
           fucked everything up.

                          JASON
           Look, the real point is not to get
           yourself in this position. That's what
           you have to realize. You gotta know
           all the tricks. Like, for example, if
           a woman's on top, she can't get
           pregnant. It's just gravity.

                          JONAH
           Everyone knows that.

           I think it's awesome that you're gonna
           have a kid, man. Think of it like
           this. It's just an excuse to play with
           all your old toys again.

                          JONAH
           You know what I think you should do?
           Take care of it.

           Yes, I do, and I won't say it for
           little Baby Ears over there, but it
           rhymes with shmish-mortion." I'm just
           saying -- hold on Jay, cover your ears
           -- you should get a "shmish-morshmion"
           are the "shmish-morshmion" clinic.

                          JAY
           Ben, you cannot let these monsters
           have any part of your child's life.
           All right? I'm gonna be there to rear

                          ALISON
           Well, I'm not gonna tell them for a

           say anything.

                          BETTY
           How could you not tell them?

                          ALISON
           Well, they're not gonna know. I mean,
           I'm only gonna start to show when I'm

           It is, you know?

           I had a vision for how my life would

           Right. If it grows in the ground, it's
           probably okay.

                          BEN
           I guess it worked. You told me not to

           Not the whole time. Just in the
           evenings and all day every weekend.
           Not that much.

                          BEN
           Honestly, though, when you look at me,
           do you not think at all, like, you
           know, if he just never existed, I
           would have avoided a massive heap of
           trouble? You know?

                          HARRIS
           Absolutely not. I love you totally and
           completely. You're the best thing that
           ever happened to me.

                          BEN
           I'm the best thing that ever happened
           to you?

                          HARRIS
           Yeah.

                          BEN
           Now I just feel bad for you.

           Hey Alison, how's it goin'?

                          ALISON
           Good, good. You know, I was just
           calling to, let you know that, I've
           decided to keep the baby.That's what's
           happening with that.

                          BEN
           Good. That's good. That's what I was
           hoping you'd do. So, awesome.

                          ALISON
           Yeah, yeah, it is good.

                          BEN
           I know we didn't plan this and neither
           of us really thought it was gonna
           happen but life is like that, you
           know? You can't plan for it and even
           if we did, life doesn't care about
           your plans, necessarily, and you just
           kinda have to go with the flow and I
           just know my job is to just support
           you in whatever it is you wanna do.
           I'm in, so whatever you wanna do, I'm
           gonna do.

           I really appreciate you saying that.

                          BEN
           No problem. I'll tell you, maybe if
           you could help me by telling me, like
           one thing that I am supposed to do,
           then that would be good, `cause I
           literally have no idea whatsoever.

                          ALISON
           I have no idea either.

                          BEN
           Do you want to, like, get together and
           talk about it or something like that?

           You must be angry at the baby whenever
           it steals your food, huh? "Oh it's
           mine, not yours." But, you know...
           Because you're family, you got to
           share.

                          ALISON

           this shit.

           What the fuck, man?! If I go in there
           and see fuckin' pubes sprinkled on the
           toiled seat, I'm gonna fuckin' lose my
           mind! Last time I went to the
           bathroom, Jay, I took a shit and my
           shit looked like a fuckin' stuffed
           animal!

                          JAY

           Yeah.

           If this hadn't happened, I don't think
           I would have wanted to have a baby
           for, like, I don't know, at least ten
           years.

                          BEN
           At least! God, honestly, I just got
           used to the notion that someone would
           even have sex with me. I didn't think
           this would happen.

                          ALISON
           A little, so far. I mean, we have
           seven months before the baby comes. We
           don't have to rush it.

                          BEN
           Yeah.

                          ALISON
           We should really just try to get to
           know each other and...give this a real
           shot. You know? We got ourselves into
           this situation. We kind of have to.

                          BEN
           For the baby, right?

                          ALISON
           Exactly. Okay, if this was our second
           date, what would you do?

                          BEN
           B.J. If I'm just being honest. I told
           my roommates that I thought I was
           gonna get a B.J., so...

                          ALISON
           You know what? For the sake of getting
           to know one another, can you not talk
           like that?

                          BEN
           I can do that. I'm really nervous.

                          ALISON
           I'm nervous, too. I'm really nervous.

                          BEN
           Yeah.
          Ben and Alison kiss.

                          ALISON
           You're a sweet guy, right?

                          BEN
           I think I am.

                          ALISON
           Don't fuck me over, okay?

                          BEN
           I wouldn't do that. Just so you know,
           I'm the guy girls fuck over. I'm that
           guy. So you don't fuck me over, okay?

                          ALISON
           Okay.

                          BEN
           I couldn't take it. I can't raise this
           baby alone.

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, KITCHEN

          Debbie, Pete, Charlotte, Sadie, Alison and Ben eat breakfast
          together.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Who's he?

                          BEN
           I'm Ben Stone.

                          ALISON
           He's my boyfriend.

                          PETE
           That's nice.

                          SADIE
           I never met him before.

                          ALISON
           He's a new boyfriend.

                          BEN
           But a boyfriend.

                          SADIE
           So he came over for breakfast because
           he's your new boyfriend?

                          DEBBIE
           He came from his house, drove over to
           our house because he thought it would
           be fun to have breakfast with us, so
           he drove his car from his house to our
           house to have breakfast.

                          PETE
           Because he likes breakfast so much.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I love breakfast.

                          BEN
           You guys wanna hear something neat?
           We're gonna have a baby together.

                          SADIE
           What?

                          BEN
           Yeah, a baby.

                          SADIE
           Well, you're not married. Aren't you
           supposed to be married to have a baby?

           KNOCKED UP - 56.

                         

                          PETE
           You don't have to be.

                          DEBBIE
           But they should be because they love
           each other and people who love each
           other get married and have babies.

                          SADIE
           Where do babies come from?

                          DEBBIE
           Where do you think they come from?

                          SADIE
           Well, I think a stork, he drops it
           down, and then, a hole goes in your
           body and there's blood everywhere,
           coming out of your head, and then you
           push your belly-button, and then your
           butt falls off and then you hold you
           butt and you have to dig and you find
           a little baby.

                          DEBBIE
           That's exactly right.

                         

          EXT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BACKYARD

          Ben is in a playhouse with Sadie while Charlotte jumps on the
          trampoline.

                          CHARLOTTE
           Feed the teddy bear.

                          BEN
           I feed your bear the grass? Know what
           your bear would also like to do with
           some grass? Smoke it.
          Allison and Debbie watch Ben and the kids from the patio.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           What do you think of him? He's funny,
           right?
          Ben throws the bear's bowl.

                          BEN
           Fetch. All right, bring it back.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           He's playing fetch with my kids. He's
           treating my kids like they're dogs.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           No's he not.
          Ben throws the bear this time.

           KNOCKED UP - 57.

                         

                          BEN
           Go get it! Fetch!

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           Plays fetch with the kids.

                          BEN
           All right!

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           He's trying. He's making an effort.

                          CHARLOTTE
           I don't wanna play this anymore.

                          BEN
           Bring it back.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           He's overweight. Where does that end?
           How old is he?

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           Twenty-three.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           Looks thirty-three. He can barely get
           in and out of that little house.
           Imagine how much bigger he's going to
           get.
          Ben tries to exit the playhouse but gets stuck a couple times.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           That means he has bad genes. Your kid
           is going to be overweight.

                          ALISON
           Shit.

                          BEN
           I'm gonna get you!
          Ben chases the girls on top of the trampoline.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           I'm gonna get you! Whoa!
          Ben falls off the trampoline onto the grass. The kids love it.

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           Just give him a break.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO ALISON)
           Okay, I'll try.

          EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

          Ben and Pete sit while Charlotte and Sadie blow bubbles.

                          BEN
           They seem to love bubbles.

                          PETE
           They go ape-shit over bubbles.

                          BEN
           They're really going ape-shit.

                          PETE
           That's an incredible thing about a
           child. What's so great about bubbles?

                          BEN
           They float. You can pop them. I mean,
           I get it. I get it.

                          PETE
           I wish I liked anything as much as my
           kids like bubbles.

                          BEN
           That's sad.

                          PETE
           It's totally sad. Their smiling faces
           just point out your inability to enjoy
           anything.

                          BEN
           Am I going to be okay, man?

                          PETE
           Who knows? Is anybody okay? I'm not
           okay. You're asking the wrong guy.
           Just don't ask me to lend you any
           money, you know?

                          BEN
           Can I just have some?

                          PETE
           No.

                          BEN
          I can't ref the next games, by the
          way. I got to go meet gynecologists
          with Alison. She doesn't like her
          gynecologist.

                          JAY
          You think she likes you?

                          BEN
          She's trying to.

                          JAY
          She's entertaining the idea of liking
          you.

                          BEN
          Exactly. I'll take that.

                          JAY
          Wll, see she's bringing you to the
          gynechiatrist. She must like you.

                          BEN
          That's pretty good, I think.

                          JASON
          You know who I'd like to get pregnant
          is that Felicity Huffman, man. Ever
          since "Transamerica," I can't get her
          out of my mind.

                          BEN
          Guys, I hate to crack the whip, but
          it's kind of, uh, business meeting
          time. I need moolah. When do you think
          we can launch this site?

                          JAY
          Geez.

                          JONAH
          You can't rush this. You know what
          happens to these sites when they go up
          and they don't function well? They
          die.

                          BEN
          Seriously, guys, let's say I want to
          launch today. Let's start... let's use
          that as a jumping off point. Let's
          make this happen. What can we do?

                          JONAH
          Look, man, I didn't go to Yale so I
          could work twelve hours a day.

           City College.

                          JONAH
           I went where I went, Jason.

                          BEN
           I'm not asking you to work twelve
           hours a day. I mean, you guys watch
           movies without nudity in them.

                          JASON
           I'll tell you what, man. We could
           probably get it online in three
           months.

                          BEN
           Thank you. Yes! Three months.

                          JONAH
           Come on, Jason!
          Jason serves the ball and Jonah hits it as hard as he can to win
          the game.

           Fuck off!

           On occasion? When? When was the last

           How many doctors are there in your
           practice? Just because I'm sort of
           looking for a more personal
           experience. I want to make sure that
           you're my doctor on the day and...

           DR. HOWARD
           I understand. We have three other
           doctors in the practice but I'm your
           man, okay? I don't take vacations. I
           hate Hawaii. I went to the Caribbean
           when I was fourteen and I'm never
           going back.

                          ALISON
           I feel really good about this.

                          (TO BEN)
           I think we found our doctor.

                          BEN
           Really?

           Yeah.

           Oh, my God. Are you serious right now?

           DR. HOWARD
           You look relieved.

                          BEN
           I am very relieved.

           DR. HOWARD
           All right.

           Oh, shit. I haven't told them. Do you
           think they're gonna be mad? I'm really
           chickening out about this.

                          WARDROBE LADY
           It's okay. We can hide this. We'll

           Your boobs are going to be big. And
           then they're going to be like scary
           big. But then they'll go down. And
           then they'll stay down.

           Just don't say anything, okay? Please
           don't say anything.

           Those are sex offenders. These people
           live in our neighborhood.

           We'll skip their houses when we're
           trick or treating. What do you want me

           Got your six-shooter on ya? I got my

           You shouldn't take it so lightly.

                          PETE
           I don't take it lightly. I'm not going
           to go over to any of these people's
           houses and say, "Hey, you mind? Can

           don't get them vaccinated, don't let
           them eat fish. There's mercury in the

           don't know what I can say.

                          DEBBIE
           So I'm the bad guy because I'm trying
           to protect our kids from child
           molesters and mercury? And you're cool
           because you don't give a shit?

           Yeah.

           Pretty much.

           God, you're an asshole.

           Don't do this in front of Ben.

          We've been watching you on E! It's the
          coolest thing.

                          ALISON
          Yeah, it's been super-exciting, just
          crazy busy. I'm so sorry I haven't
          called.

          Oh, it's fine.

          This is my friend, Ben.

          I'm Ben.

          I went to school with Alison.

                          GIRL #1
          So, okay, so is Debbie having another
          baby?

          No. Alison is.

          What?! I just saw you a couple months
          ago. You're pregnant?

                          ALISON
          It was a big surprise.

                          BEN
          It's a really funny story, actually,
          if you guys, if you got a second to
          hear it.

                          ALISON
          It's not really funny.

                          GIRL #1
          Tell us.

                          ALISON
          It's not funny.

                          BEN
          Let them be the judge, okay? I think
          it's funny.

           Yeah, she was acting weird and I
           really think it's just because I
           haven't made an honest woman out of
           her. She's carrying my bastard child.
           No one wants that.

                          PETE
           That's what I did. I married Debbie
           when she got pregnant.

                          BEN
           You think she's, like, hiding me?
           Like, she's, like, embarrassed by me
           or something like that?

                          PETE
           Probably. I'd hide you.

                          BEN
           How much do wedding rings cost?

                          PETE
           It really depends, you know? I think
           you're supposed to spend three months
           pay on a ring.

                          BEN
           That'll be easy. I don't make any
           money.

                          PETE

          INT. ALISON'S GUEST HOUSE

          Alison sits on the bed while Ben kneels in front of her.

                          BEN
           Alison, I'm sure this isn't how you
           pictured it being exactly and it's not
           how I wanted it. That is why I'm
           presenting you with this empty box.
           It's a promise, Alison. A promise that
           one day I will fill this with a ring
           that you deserve, a beautiful ring. I
           can't afford it yet. I've picked it
           out, though. It's at De Beers and it's
           really nice. So, basically, I'm asking
           you, will you marry me? Because I'm in
           love with you.

                          ALISON
           I love you too.

                          BEN
           Really? That's so nice to hear. That's
           the first time a girl's ever said that
           to me.

                          ALISON

           There's a thing?

                          ALISON
           I don't really know yet what that love
           means. It's so new and it's so
           exciting. It's great. I don't know.
           We've only known each other for
           seventeen weeks.

                          BEN
           Look, I thought you felt weird that
           we're having a baby and we're not
           engaged. I'm going to get off my knee.
           It hurts.
          Ben sits next to Alison on the bed.

                          ALISON
           I'm okay with that. We're just doing
           what we can. I don't want us to put
           any more pressure on ourselves than we
           have.

                          BEN
           That makes sense.

                          ALISON
           I didn't hurt your feelings, did I?

                          BEN
           No. I just wanted to do right by you.
           If you don't want to, that's totally
           cool.

                          ALISON
           I really do love you.

                          BEN
           I know. Thanks. You mentioned that.

           Ben proposed to me. He did. It was
           really sweet. I feel a little bad. He
           was wearing this great button-down. He
           tucked it in. He got down on one knee.
           He didn't have an actual ring, though,
           just an empty box but he had this
           whole spiel about when he has the
           money, he'll buy me the ring I
           deserve.

                          DEBBIE
           The box was empty?

                          ALISON
           He can't afford a ring.

           you an empty box?

                          ALISON
           Yes.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm sorry.

                          ALISON
           Get over it. If you'd been there, you
           would have cried.

                          DEBBIE
           You need to train him. Oprah said that
           when two people meet they should point
           out each other's differences and
           flaws.

                          ALISON
           I thought you should love people for
           who they are.

                          DEBBIE
           You criticize them a lot, so they get
           so down on themselves they have to
           change.

                          ALISON
           You don't think that's naggy?

           You can't commit to him. You don't
           even know him. I don't even know Pete
           after ten years. I don't know what
           he's up to. He's miserable.

           Why do you say that?

                          DEBBIE
           I think he's cheating on me. He's
           always going to business meetings at
           odd hours. Then I try to call him on
           his cell phone and he says he's in bad
           cell phone reception areas when he's
           in good reception areas.

                          ALISON
           Maybe he's working late. Maybe he's
           trying to sign a new band. I can't
           imagine Pete doing that.

                          DEBBIE

           maybe he's a dirty little scumbag?

                          ALISON
           No. I don't have to. It's illegal for

           ...I had this flash of me in a white
           Ford Bronco hauling ass for Canada.
           The chopper's taping it, and I bust
           through the border and I'm free! I
           kept thinking that.
          Alison stares at Ben.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           It was a flash!

                          ALISON
           What do you mean?

                          BEN
           Don't look at me. We can talk about
           our fears here. If Doc Brown screeched
           up to you in the DeLorean and said,
           "Alison, I got the car here. What do
           you want to do?" No part of you would
           think, "Maybe I'll go back to that
           night and put a condom on Ben's dick?"
           You never got that flash?

                          ALISON
           No. What are you talking about?

                          PETE

           roads."

                          BEN
           You wouldn't do that?

                          ALISON
           I don't know who Doc Brown is. What
           are you talking about?

                          BEN
           Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd. He
           invented the DeLorean time machine.

                          PETE
           Everyone has a time machine image.

                          DEBBIE
           I have a really good idea. Why don't
           you two get in your time machine, go
           back in time and fuck each other?

                          PETE
           Who needs a time machine?
          Ben holds up his drink.

                          BEN
           This is my time machine!

                          PETE

                          (TO BEN)
           I'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun
           it to 88.

                          BEN

                          (TO PETE)
           You are a funny motherfucker, man.

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           How can you fight with him? I just
           want to kiss his face. He's cute.

                          PETE

                          (TO BEN)
           I like the way you move.

                          BEN
           This is fun! We should do this more.
           This is the most fun I've had in a
           really long time.

          Ben and Alison are having sex. Ben is on top.

           Come on, harder.

                          BEN
           I can't.

                          ALISON
           Why? Just do it deeper.

                          BEN
           I can't.

                          ALISON
           Why?

                          BEN
           I'll poke the baby if I go deeper.

                          ALISON
           Just do it!

                          BEN
           Please don't yell at me.

                          ALISON
           The doctor and Debbie said it's fine.
           Come on!
          Ben stops.

                          BEN
           I'm sorry, can we change positions?
           I'm going to crush the baby.

                          ALISON
           That's ridiculous!

                          BEN
           No, it's not. It has no shell.

                          ALISON
           Millions of people have sex when
           they're pregnant! It just works!

                          BEN
           I weigh over 200 pounds.

                          ALISON
           Just get over it.

                          BEN
           I can't do it. Can you just get on
           top? All I can see if our baby, poked
           in the face by my penis.

                          ALISON
           Trust me, you're not even close. Okay,
           fine.
          Alison moves on top. Alison abruptly stops.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           I can't do this. I can't focus like
           this. I look disgusting from this
           angle. I can feel you looking at my
           chins.

                          BEN
           You look beautiful. Your chin looks so
           skinny.

           KNOCKED UP - 79.

           And my boobs are all like, squishy and
           they're flopping around. I can feel it
           and it's distracting. It's all
           National Geographic.

                          (WHISPERING)
           Do you want to do it doggie style?

                          ALISON
           No. I do not want you to fuck me like
           a dog.

                          BEN
           I'm not fucking you like a dog. It's
           doggie style. It's just the style.
           I'm, it's not like a dog. We don't
           have to go outside or anything.
          Ben and Alison lie down side by side, Ben is behind.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Here we go. Is it good?

                          ALISON
           Yeah.

                          BEN
           Should I go slower?

                          ALISON
           Harder.

                          BEN
           Just tell me when you're close.

                          ALISON
           Just go harder.

                          BEN
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Keep going!
          Ben recoils.

                          BEN
           Oh, God. Oh, fuck!

                          ALISON
           What happened?

                          BEN
           The baby. It kicked my hand.

                          ALISON
           It always kicks.

                          BEN
           No, no, no, no, no.

           KNOCKED UP - 80.

           It's fine.

                          BEN
           Not like this. No, this was a warning
           kick.

                          ALISON
           Just keep going.

                          BEN
           This was a bad kick.

                          ALISON
           It's fine! It's fine!

                          BEN
           Look. My dick must be like an inch
           away from its face and it's coming,
           just coming in at its face. What if it
           kicked because it didn't like it? I
           can't do that to our baby. That's the
           first thing it's going to see.

                          ALISON
           What are you talking about?

                          BEN
           It's having the baby between us, it
           just makes it weird. I'm sorry. It
           just freaks me out a bit. It's a
           little weird.

                          ALISON
           I have totally lost it now.

                          BEN
           You've totally lost it?

                          ALISON
           I've lost it.

                          BEN
           Okay.

                          ALISON
           Great, you know what? Just forget it.
          Alison turns her back to Ben and gets settled to sleep.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           (holding back tears)
           Don't worry. I won't make you do this
           again.

          Ben stands up and tries to steady himself.

           Fuck me.
          Jay runs through the room towards the front door.

                          JAY
           Oh my God! It's the Russians.
          Martin carries Jodi out.

                          MARTIN
           Jodi! I'll protect you!
          Ben clutches his bong and runs to the door. Alison runs to the
          door as well.

                          ALISON
           Ben!

                          BEN

          Jay, Martin, Alison, Jodi, Jonah, Jason and Ben stand on the

                          JAY
           That was horrible! That was so
           horrible.

                          JASON
           You're fine, man.

                          JAY
           When will it be light out?

                          JASON
           Take it easy.

                          JAY
           When will it be light out?

                          JASON
           Did anybody turn off the gas?

                          MARTIN
           I didn't do it.

           KNOCKED UP - 82.

          Jason runs back to the house.

                          JONAH
           Martin, this is my friend, Alex. She's
           a pretty incredible person.

                          MARTIN
           Nice to meet you.
          Martin holds out his hand to shake Alex's. She removes one hand
          from covering her breast to shake his hand. Jonah immediately
          covers her breast with his hand.

                          JONAH
           Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dude! Not cool,
           Martin.

                          MARTIN
           That's, that wasn't...

           Hey, are you serious, Howard Hughes?

                          JODI
           What happened?

                          MARTIN
           Nothing. Nothing happened. Come on.

           Where were you?

                          BEN
           Look, I forgot you were sleeping over.
           I'm sorry okay?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, because you were getting high
           off your huge bong. How am I supposed
           to be comfortable with the idea that
           you can take care of me and the baby
           if you are always getting high?

                          BEN
           You want me to stop smoking pot
           because there's an earthquake once
           every ten years? That makes no sense,
           Alison. You're being irrational. Just
           relax. We're all scared. Oh, shit, the
           cops.
          A cop car rolls by. Ben throws his bong behind him and it SHATTERS
          on the payment.

          Ben and Alison sort through the debris of porn, trash and weed
          among other things.
          Alison finds Ben's bank statement that indicates he only has only

          $117.13.

                          BEN
           You know it's times like this I'm glad
           I don't own nice things. It's a big
           mess, but there's only like fifty
           bucks worth of shit here. That's kind
           of the good thing. You know, my dad
           told me, "Don't move to Northridge."
           But you figure, what are the chances
           of that happening twice, you know?
          Alison picks up a huge sword.

                          ALISON
           What is this?

                          BEN
           It's a ninja weapon. I hope this place
           doesn't get condemned. That would
           suck.
          Alison finds a shopping bag with the baby books they bought. None
          of them have been read. Alison sadly puts them back without Ben
          noticing.

                          BEN
           Oh, man. I don't want to do that.

                          ALISON
           Ben, come on.

                          BEN
           He's not cheating on her.

                          ALISON
           How do you know?

                          BEN
           I just know.

                          ALISON
           Are you sure?

                          BEN
           I'm one hundred percent sure he's not
           cheating.

                          ALISON
           Are you really?

                          BEN
           No. It actually kind of makes sense
           that he would cheat.

                          ALISON
           Why?

                          BEN
           Because Debbie's a pain in the ass and
           Pete's awesome?

                          ALISON
           Well, why don't you just come over
           then, and, we'll just diffuse the
           situation a little?

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          Alison, Ben, Pete and Debbie have dinner.

                          PETE
           I'm just saying the music industry is
           different now. Steely Dan would never
           even have a chance.

                          BEN
           Well, maybe it's because Steely Dan
           gargles my balls.

                          PETE
           They're incredible.

           KNOCKED UP - 85.

                         

                          BEN
           They really aren't good, man.

                          PETE
           Old Steely Dan.

                          BEN
           If I ever listen to Steely Dan, I want
           you to slice my head off with an Al
           Jarreau LP.

                          PETE
           I should get going. I'm supposed to
           see this band tonight in Hollywood.
           Actually, they're playing in Laurel
           Canyon, so I'll call you because the
           reception's terrible over there.

                          BEN
           That's true.

                          PETE
           And I don't want you to worry. I'm
           just going to jump in the shower. It
           would be terrible if I smelled worse
           than the band.

                          DEBBIE
           Okay. Have fun.
          Ben exits.

                          BEN
           You guys are crazy. He's acting
           totally normal and hilarious.

                         

          EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE - NIGHT

          Debbie pulls up in front of the house in her car with Alison and
          Ben.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
           She doesn't have a gun, does she?

                          ALISON
           No. I don't think so.

                          BEN
           Oh, great.

                         

          INT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE

          Debbie tries the front door, it's unlocked. They enter.

                          BEN
           Looks like no one's home.

                          DEBBIE
           Why was the door unlocked? Wait here.

           KNOCKED UP - 86.

                         

                          BEN
           I just feel bad for Pete.

                          ALISON
           What?

                          BEN
           I feel like this isn't a good way to
           get caught cheating, it shouldn't be
           like this.

                          ALISON
           Well, maybe he should have thought of
           that before he was cheating.

                          BEN
           (through a fake cough)
           Pete!

                          ALISON
           Stop it.

                          BEN
           I coughed. What do you want from me?
          Debbie checks upstairs.

                          DEBBIE
           There's nobody up there.

                          BEN
           Thank you.

                          DEBBIE
           I guess I was wrong.

                          BEN
           I told you. Can we get out of here,
           please?

                          ALISON
           Yeah, come on. Let's go.
          A MURMUR comes from a far room.

                          DEBBIE
           Did you hear that?

                          ALISON
           What?

                          BEN
           I didn't hear anything.

                          ALISON
           Come on.
          Debbie leads them into a room, where Pet sits with a lot of GUYS
          dressed in baseball clothing.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           Ten seconds.

           KNOCKED UP - 87.

                         

                          PETE
           Carlos Delgado.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
           Excellent choice. Too bad I got him
           three rounds ago.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           You're still on the clock.

                          PETE
           Oh shit!

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           You gotta do something. We need a name
           here.

                          PETE
           Hideki Matsui.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #1
           Ugh, you just took my whole outfield.

                          PETE
           Sorry, Charlie.

                          DEBBIE
           What is this?

                          PETE
           Debbie.

                          DEBBIE
           What the fuck is this?

                          PETE
           It's our fantasy baseball draft.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
           We said no wives.

                          DEBBIE
           Your fantasy what?

                          PETE
           It's, it's our draft...for fantasy
           baseball. I told you all about this.
           Got Matsui.
          Debbie turns and walks out of the room.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Aw, shit.

           FANTASY BASEBALL GUY #2
           Hey, Pete, don't let the door hit you
           in the vagina on the way out! Come on,
           who's going?

                         

          EXT. FANTASY BASEBALL HOUSE

          Pete and Debbie are in the driveway while Alison and Ben watch
          from the street.

           KNOCKED UP - 88.

                         

                          PETE
          I should have told you.

                          DEBBIE
          What else have you been lying about?

                          PETE
          Nothing.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
          That guy said, "Don't let the door hit
          you in the vagina on the way out."

                          DEBBIE
          Where were you on Wednesday?

                          PETE
          I'm going to be honest with you.

                          ALISON

                          (TO BEN)
          Yeah, I heard him.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
          That was hilarious.

                          DEBBIE
          That would be a good idea.

                          PETE
          You've been mad because I've been
          working so much and I didn't want to
          upset you.

                          DEBBIE
          I wouldn't be mad.

                          PETE
          You would be.

                          DEBBIE
          I don't get mad.

                          PETE
          It's a fantasy baseball draft. I'm not
          cheating or anything.

                          DEBBIE
          No, this is worse.

                          PETE
          How is this worse?

                          DEBBIE
          This is you wanting to be with your
          friends more than your family.

                          PETE
          Look, the reason I make that up is
          because if I told you what I was
          really doing, you would just get mad.
          So, you think I'm seeing a band, I do
          my fantasy draft, and it's win/win.

           KNOCKED UP - 89.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           Well, what did you do last Wednesday
           night when you said you went to see a
           band?

                          PETE
           I went to the movies.

                          DEBBIE
           With who?

                          PETE
           By myself.

                          DEBBIE
           What'd you see?

                          PETE
           "Spiderman Three."

                          DEBBIE
           Why do you want to go by yourself? Why
           didn't you ask me to go?

                          PETE
           Because I needed to get away, you
           know? With work and you and the kids,
           sometimes I just need some time to
           myself.

                          DEBBIE
           I need time for myself. I want time
           for myself, too.
          Debbie holds back tears.

                          DEBBIE (CONT'D)
           You're not the only one.

                          PETE
           It's not that big of a deal.

                          DEBBIE

                          (THROUGH TEARS)
           I like Spiderman.

                          PETE
           Okay, so let's see "Spiderman Three"
           next week.

                          DEBBIE
           I don't want to go see it now.

                          PETE
           Well...

                          DEBBIE
           I don't want to have to ask you to ask
           me. I want you to just come up with it
           on your own.

                          PETE
           What? I don't even know what to say.
           Uh, what do you want me to do?

           KNOCKED UP - 90.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           You just think because you don't yell
           that you're not mean, but this is
           mean.

                          PETE
           I'm not being mean. I'm being honest.
           You're telling me I need to be honest.

                          JUST--

                          DEBBIE
           No, you're not. You're lying.

                          PETE
           I'm doing it because I need to keep my
           sanity a little bit.

                          DEBBIE
           You know what? I don't want you at the
           house anymore. Okay?

                          PETE
           Come on.
          Debbie heads for the car.

                          BEN
           Oh, shit, she's coming back.

                         

          I/E ALISON CAR - DAY
          Alison drives to the gynecologist with Ben.

                          BEN
           How come we go to the gynecologist so
           often? I bet we have to go so much so
           we can pay for that three-hundred-
           thousand-dollar machine he has.

                          ALISON
           I cannot stop thinking about what an
           asshole Pete is.

                          BEN
           That's a little strong, I would say.

                          ALISON
           Really? Because that had to be one of
           the most selfish things I've ever
           witnessed.

                          BEN
           It's understandable. I even think it's
           kind of funny.

                          ALISON
           What's funny about it?

                          BEN
           Well, you won't laugh now, I wouldn't
           imagine, but you know, the situation.

          We break into this stranger's house
          thinking we're going to find him
          sleeping with a woman, and then it's a
          bunch of nerds playing fantasy
          baseball.If you saw that on
          television, you would laugh.

          Is that what you think?

          Yeah.

                          ALISON
          Is that what you want to do, Ben?

                          BEN
          I don't even like baseball. I'm just
          saying when you're a guy and you have
          a family and you have responsibility,
          you lose that male camaraderie, and I
          get that. I totally understand where
          he's coming from.

                          ALISON
          Why do you guys always go to that
          place? You miss male camaraderie. What
          do I give a shit? Go hang out with
          your bearded freak friends. I don't
          care. You want to hang out with guys
          that look like the Shoe Bomber, it's
          all on you, man.

                          ALISON
          You should just support me! You know,
          you should just support everything I
          say because at this juncture in my
          life, I'm allowed to be wrong!

                          BEN
          So if you're wrong, I have to support
          it?

                          ALISON
          Yes!

                          BEN
          I can't tell you that you're acting
          like a lunatic?

                          ALISON
          Oh, that's helpful. You have to do
          nothing!

                          BEN
          I've sacrificed a lot of shit to this!

                          ALISON
          You are just fucking sitting there!
          You haven't sacrificed anything!

           I have.

                          ALISON
           I've had to sacrifice my job, my body,
           my youth, my vagina!

                          BEN
           You've sacrificed your vagina?

                          ALISON
           Yes! It will never look the same after
           this!

                          BEN
           Well. Fine. I'll pay for vaginal
           reconstructive surgery.

                          ALISON
           You can't pay for shit! You can barely
           buy spaghetti.

                          BEN
           You're right. Fine!

                          ALISON
           You know what? Get out of the car.

                          BEN
           Oh! You know what? Why don't you not
           threaten me?!

                          ALISON
           You should just get out of the fucking
           car.

                          BEN
           I'm not going to get out of the car in
           the middle of nowhere! No!

                          ALISON
           Get out of the car.

                          BEN
           No!

           I own this car! Get out of my car!

          Ben gets out of the car and immediately KNOCKS on the window.

                          BEN
           Can you let me back in the car,
           please? Have you calmed down? Did you
           take a breath? I have no clue where we
           are!
          Alison just glares at him.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Fine. Go. Great.
          Alison drives off.

                         

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S OFFICE - LATER

          Alison stands on a scale while DR. HOWARD'S NURSE weighs her.

                          ALISON
           You know what? Maybe I should take my
           shoes off. Or my belt buckle. My belt
           buckle's huge.

           DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
           Don't worry about gaining weight. Your
           baby wants you to gain a whole mess of
           weight.
          Ben walks into the room, winded.

                          ALISON

                          (TO BEN)
           Are you fucking kidding me?

                          BEN
           Why don't you take off your earrings,
           too? They weigh about eighty pounds.
           They're made out of moon rocks aren't
           they?

                          ALISON
           Do not make fun of me. Okay? I am
           hormonal, I am terrified, and I am
           falling apart, so stop treating
           everything like it's a big joke!

                          BEN
           I'm sorry you're freaking out, but I
           just walked three fucking miles
           through Koreatown to get here. Sorry
           if I'm trying to lighten the mood a
           little.
          The Nurse leaves.

                          ALISON
           Well, don't! Okay?! You can't take
           anything seriously! You didn't even
           read the baby books.

                          BEN
           I didn't read the baby books! What's
           gonna happen? How did anyone ever give
           birth without a baby book?!

                          (MORE)

           That's right, the ancient Egyptians
           fucking engraved "What to Expect When
           You're Expecting" on the pyramid
           walls! I forgot about that! Who gives
           a flying fuck about the baby books?!

                          ALISON
           It just shows your lack of commitment,
           Ben! That you're not in this with me!

                          BEN
           Did you just say my lack of
           commitment? Because that's what it
           sounded like. It almost seems as
           though you forgot I proposed to you
           like an asshole! And you said no to
           me!

                          ALISON
           If you feel that way, you should just
           go. Really. Just go. Because we didn't
           mean to do this together, okay? And,
           and we tried to make it work and that
           was good, I suppose.
          Alison holds back tears.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           But it doesn't work. Because we are
           two completely different people. And I
           think it would just be easier for both
           of us if we stop fooling ourselves.

                          BEN
           You know what? I know this isn't you
           talking, it's your hormones, but I
           would just like to say, "Fuck you,
           hormones! You are a crazy bitch,
           hormones! Not Alison! Hormones!" Fuck
           them. It's a girl. Buy some pink shit!

                          ALISON
           Nice. You are such an asshole. You
           know what? Go fuck your fucking bong,
           you fuck!

                          BEN
           I will fuck my bong. Doggie-style, for
           once.
          Ben exits while giving Alison the finger as her walks away. Dr.
          Howard's Nurse returns.

           DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
           Are you ready?

                          ALISON
           I'm really sorry about all that. That
           was really inappropriate.

           DR. HOWARD'S NURSE
           That's okay. It happens all the time
           here. It's fine.

           Not at all.

                          BEN
           I totally know what you're talking
           about, man. If I wrote out the list of
           shit Alison doesn't let me do it would
           be endless. Don't smoke pot. Don't
           have samurai swords in your room.
           Don't have illegal grow operations in
           the house. I could go on all fucking
           day. Have I told her to stop doing
           anything ever? No.

                          PETE
           Marriage is like that show "Everybody
           Loves Raymond," but it's not funny.
           All the problems are the same, but
           it's... Instead of all the funny,
           pithy dialogue, everybody's just
           really pissed off and tense. Marriage
           is like an unfunny, tense version of
           "Everybody Loves Raymond," but it
           doesn't last twenty-two minutes. It
           lasts forever.

                          BEN
           Let's get out of here, man. Honestly,
           let's just go. Let's go to Vegas.

           Get up.

           What are you doing?

          Jason opens the door with Jonah and Jay. All of their eyes are

           We got pink eye.

           kisses or something?

                          JASON
           Very funny. That's not how you get
           pink eye. You get it from poo
           particles making their way into your
           ocular cavities.

           Yo.

                          JAY
           How's it going? I farted on Jason's
           pillow as a practical joke. He farted
           on Jonah's, thinking it was mine. And
           then eventually pink-eyes my pillow.
           I'm not proud of this. But, I think
           we've all forgiven each other. But, we
           can't go anywhere.

                          PETE
           You can get pink eye from farting in a
           pillow?

                          JONAH
           Totally.

                          PETE
           That's awesome.

                          BEN
           Jesus. Martin got it bad! What, did
           someone take a dump right in your eye?

                          MARTIN
           No. No pink eye for me. I'm just

           Well stay back, guys. I got to get my

          Ben enters the house and the guys pretend they're going to rub

           Yep. It's like I can't come here with
           Debbie. She doesn't understand. It's
           like she wants to hold me in, and she
           was telling Alison she could train
           you.

                          BEN
           She thinks she could train me?

                          PETE
           I see the beam of light.

           KNOCKED UP - 99.

                         

                          BEN
           There it is, baby.

                          PETE
           Woo-hoo. You're so money that you
           don't even know how much money you
           have.

                         

          INT. STRIP CLUB

          Ben and Pete receive lap dances from topless strippers.

                          BEN
           I love Vegas, man.

                          PETE
           This is the greatest place on earth.

                          BEN
           It's really amazing here.
          The stripper straddles Pete and pulls his tie through her legs so
          that he face is pulled against her butt.

                          PETE
           Whoa. You got my tie. This is awesome.

                          BEN
           Now that's how you get pink eye.

                         

          EXT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison approach the nightclub, passing the line,
          straight to the DOORMAN. The Doorman lets TWO PRETTY GIRLS past
          the rope.

                          DOORMAN
           (to the Two Pretty Girls)
           Hey, what's up, baby girl?
          Debbie and Alison move up to the doorman.

                          DEBBIE
           Hi.

                          DOORMAN
           What's up? End of the line, please.

                          DEBBIE
           Really?

                          DOORMAN
           Yeah.

                          DEBBIE
           Oh, come on.

                          DOORMAN
           Look, we're at capacity, okay? We'll
           let some people in when it clears out
           a little. You'll get right in if you
           go back to the end of the line.

           KNOCKED UP - 100.

                         

                          DEBBIE
           We come here all the time. It's not a
           big deal. It doesn't really look that
           crowded in there.

                          DOORMAN
           Hey, look, I don't make the rules.

                          DEBBIE
           Please?

                          DOORMAN
           No.
          TWO CUTE GIRLS approach. The Doorman lifts the rope for them.

                          DOORMAN (CONT'D)
           Hey, what's up, shorty? What's up
           pretty girls? See y'all when y'all get
           out. Take care of yourself.

                          DEBBIE
           What was that? What the fuck was that?

                          DOORMAN
           It is what it is, sweetie. Now can you
           step to the back, please?

                          ALISON

                          (TO DEBBIE)
           You know what? Maybe we should just
           go.

                          DEBBIE
           You don't need to call me sweetie.

                          DOORMAN
           Yeah, but maybe you should listen to
           your friend.

                          DEBBIE
           No, you don't need to call me sweetie.

                          DOORMAN
           All right, you want to come in, you're
           going to have to go to the end of the
           line and wait like everybody else.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm not going to go to the end of the
           fucking line. Who the fuck are you? I
           have just as much of a right to be
           here as any of these little skanky
           girls! What, am I not skanky enough
           for you?! You want me to hike up my
           fucking skirt?! What the fuck is your
           problem?! I'm not going anywhere!
           You're just some `roided out freak
           with a fucking clipboard. And your
           stupid little fucking rope! You may
           have power now, but you're not God.
           You're a doorman! Okay? You're a
           doorman! So...fuck you, you fucking
           fag with your fucking little faggy
           gloves.

           KNOCKED UP - 101.

                         
          The Doorman grabs Debbie and takes her aside.

                          DOORMAN
           Come here, come on.
          The Doorman takes Debbie aside.

                          DOORMAN

                          (WHISPERING)
           I know. You're right. I'm so sorry. I
           fucking hate this job. I don't want to
           be the one to pass judgement and
           decide who gets in. This shit makes me
           sick to my stomach. I get the runs
           from the stress. It's not because
           you're not hot. I would love to tap
           that ass. I would tear that ass up. I
           can't let you in because you're old as
           fuck...for this club, not, you know,
           for the earth.

                          DEBBIE
           What?

                          DOORMAN
           You old. She pregnant. Can't have a
           bunch of old, pregnant bitches running
           around. That's crazy. I'm only allowed
           to let in five percent black people.
           He said that. Five percent. That mean
           if there's twenty-five people here, I
           get to let in one-and-a-quarter black
           people. So I got to hope there's a
           black midget in the crowd.

                          DEBBIE
           Now I feel guilty. I'm sorry.

                          DOORMAN
           Why y'all want to be in here anyway?
           Y'all need to be at a yoga class or
           something.

                          (REGARDING ALISON)
           What the fuck is she doing at the
           club? That's not even good parenting
           right there. Your old ass should know
           better than that.

                          DEBBIE
           Oh, God. Ugh.
          Debbie takes Alison away.

                         

          EXT. VEGAS POOL - NIGHT

          Ben and Pete hold neon yard glasses and walk past numerous
          swimsuit-clad men and women.

                          BEN
           Have the mushrooms kicked in yet?
          Ben and Pete CHUCKLE uncontrollably.

           KNOCKED UP - 102.

          Establishing shot.

                         

          INT. CIRQUE DU SOLEIL

          Ben and Pete watch from the crowd as acrobats climb poles.

           BEN AND PETE
           Ohhhhhh!

                          BEN
           This was a great idea, man.

                          PETE
           This is the best idea I've ever had in
           my life.
          Two bare-chested male acrobats start to balance on top of each
          other.

                          BEN
           What are they going to do? What in the
           world are they doing? If I shaved my
           stomach and my chest, I would look
           exactly like that. Those guys are at
           work right now.
           (imitating one of the

                          ACROBATS)
           What'd you do today? Oh, just lifted
           my brother.
          The crowd starts to APPLAUD for the acrobats.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           No! Don't applaud! He'll fall! I'm
           freaking out right now, man!
          Many acrobats in devilish outfits take the stage.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           The mushrooms are turning on me!
          A clown dressed as a GIANT BABY is part of the act. Ben YELLS
          frantically.

                          GIANT BABY
           Papa.

                          BEN
           I am not your papa.
          A giant Snail comes out onto the stage.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           I can't deal with this shit, man!
          Ben stands up and runs down the aisle towards the exit.

          EXT. STREET NEAR NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

          Debbie and Alison sit on the curb.

                          DEBBIE

                          (WEEPING)
           It's over.

                          ALISON
           What's over?

                          DEBBIE
           My youth.

                          ALISON
           Don't say that.

                          DEBBIE
           It's true. I just want to dance. I
           love dancing.

                          ALISON
           So dance.

                          DEBBIE
           I can't dance. I'm embarrassed.

                          ALISON
           I should be embarrassed. I'm a fucking
           whale and I'm trying to get into some
           stupid club and--

                          DEBBIE
           You look beautiful. You're young and
           you're tall and you got the good lips
           and boobs. I'm going to be alone.

                          ALISON
           Debbie, no, you're not.

                          DEBBIE
           Yes, I am. Oh, God! Fucking, men! I
           get worse looking and he gets better
           looking, and it's so fucking unfair.
           Oh, fuck. We should go. My babysitter
           always gets mad when we come home past
           twelve. She's such a pissy little high-
           school cunt.

                         

          INT. VEGAS HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Ben curls up on the bed with his shirt and boxers on. A scene from
          "CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN" plays on the television. Steve Martin
          juggles all of his children.

                          STEVE MARTIN

                          (ON TV)
           Let's move, gang! Come on, come on,
           come on! Jessica, can you get these
           plates and put them on the table,
           please?!

           KNOCKED UP - 104.

                         

                          BEN
           This isn't funny. That guy has twelve
           kids. It's not funny. This is sick.
           This is a sick movie. That's a lot of
           responsibility to be joking about.
           That's not funny. I got to turn this
           off. It's freaking me out.
          Pete moves several chairs into the bedroom.

                          PETE
           There are five different types of
           chairs in this hotel room.

                          BEN
           Holy fuck. What are they all doing in
           here?

                          PETE
           These are five different types of
           chair.

                          BEN
           Get them out of here, man. This is too
           many chairs for one room.

                          PETE
           There's a guy that works for this
           hotel. His whole job is to find
           chairs.
          Pete moves to a tall chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Look at this one. Look at it. It's
           gold and red and it's kind of shiny.
           Shiny thread? Unbelievable. It is
           beautiful, and it feels amazing.

                          BEN
           The tall one's gawking at me and the
           short one's being very droll. I don't
           like them.
          Pete switches to another chair.

                          PETE
           Oh, wow!

                          BEN
           It's weird that chairs even exist when
           you're not sitting on them.
          Pete switched to another tall chair.

                          PETE
           I'm up high! I'm really high up.

                          BEN
           I should've read the baby books.

                          PETE
           Why didn't you read the baby books?

           KNOCKED UP - 105.

                         

                          BEN
           Because then it's real, you know?

                          PETE
           Dude, it's real whether or not you
           read those books. That baby's coming.
          Pete sits on another chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Oh, man!

                          BEN
           Think they'll take us back?

                          PETE
           Yes. But I don't know why. Do you ever
           wonder how somebody could even like
           you?

                          BEN
           All the time, man. Like every day. I
           wonder how you like me.

                          PETE
           How can Debbie like me? She likes me.
           I mean, she loves me. The biggest
           problem in our marriage is that she
           wants me around. She loves me so much
           that she wants me around all the time.
           That's our biggest problem. And I
           can't even accept that? Uh, like that
           upsets me?!
          Ben sits up from the bed.

                          BEN
           What?

                          PETE
           She's the one. She loves me.

                          BEN
           You can't believe...that people love
           you? I love you, man! Debbie loves
           you!

                          PETE
           I don't think I can accept her love.
           There's something wrong with me.

                          BEN
           You can't accept love?

                          PETE
           I don't know what it is.

                          BEN
           Love? The most beautiful, shiny, warmy
           thing in the world? You can't accept
           it?

                          PETE
           I have to go to this other chair.

           KNOCKED UP - 106.

                         
          Pete switches to a new chair.

                          PETE (CONT'D)
           Oh, this is a better energy.

                          BEN
           You can't accept pure love? You can't
           accept Debbie? She's chosen to give
           you her life. She's picked you as her
           life partner! But you play fantasy
           baseball because you can't accept her
           love?
          Ben BURPS.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Ugh. I could accept it, man. And
           Debbie's amazing, man. She's cool and
           she's funny and she smells good and
           she's nice and her hair always looks
           different. She's too good for you,
           man.
          Pete shoves his hand in his mouth.

                          PETE
           Tastes like a rainbow.

                          BEN
           You're disgusting. You're an urchin.
           And she busts your balls because
           you're a little bitch! You're a filthy
           bitch! And I'd bust your balls! Debbie
           wants to give her life to you and
           Alison doesn't want to do that with
           me. And it makes me sad all day. I
           want to go home.

                          PETE
           (with fist in mouth)
           I want to go home, too.

           Thanks. I went kind of overboard, huh?

                          ALISON
           No, it's great.

          Ben approaches the house with a present. He wears a button-down
          shirt and long khaki shorts. He KNOCKS on the door. Sadie opens

                          BEN
           Oh, hey, what up dog?

           Where have you been?

                          BEN
           Around. You know, just kind of doing
           my thing.

                          SADIE
           Why is everybody so mad at you?

                          BEN
           I don't know. Are they mad? What have
           they been saying?

                          SADIE
           They've been saying, like "blah-blah-
           blah-blah. Ben's a prick."

                          BEN
           They said that?

                          SADIE
           A lot.

                          BEN
           That sucks.

                          SADIE
           What does it mean?

                          BEN
           Penis. It means penis.

           Did you just get pink cupcakes or
           yellow and pink cupcakes?

                          PETE
           I just got yellow cupcakes.

                          DEBBIE
           I thought I said to get pink cupcakes.

                          PETE
           I can run out. I'll get some more.

                          DEBBIE
           Nah, it's no big deal.

                          PETE
           I don't mind.

                          DEBBIE
           No it doesn't matter.

                          PETE
           You sure?

           Yeah. You look really cute in that.

           You're the one that got dressed up

           Well played, sir. That was good.

                          PETE
           You going to talk to Alison?

          Alison and Ben talk off to the side.

                          ALISON
           I just don't think we can make it
           work.

                          BEN
           We can get back on track and
           everything's going to be great.

                          ALISON
           You're just being nice. And I'm being
           nice and just because we're two nice
           people doesn't mean we should stay
           together. I don't want this baby to
           determine the rest of our lives. You
           know? Me not wanting to do this alone
           isn't enough of a reason to drag you
           into a relationship with me. It's just
           not fair. And, and don't repeat this,
           but, God, I don't want to end up like
           Debbie.

                          BEN
           But Debbie's happy.

                          ALISON
           She's happy today. But every day is a
           constant struggle for them because
           they're not right for each other. You
           know? And they have to force it and I
           don't want us to have to do that. I
           don't want to force you to be what I
           think you should be. That's wrong of
           me because you're great. You really
           are. You're great the way you are and,
           I mean, you like to get high and you
           like to do shrooms in Vegas.

           I didn't do shrooms in Vegas.

                          ALISON
           And who am I to stop you? Who am I to
           tell you that that's wrong? It's not
           wrong. It's who you are. It's what you
           enjoy and that's your life and...

                          BEN
           I'm not that guy anymore.

                          ALISON
           We can be friends. And you can be
           there when the baby is born, and in
           the baby's life as much as you want. I
           hope you will be.

                          BEN
           If you give me a shot to just show you
           that I'm con--

           Yeah.

                          (TO BEN)
           I'm sorry. I got to go. I'm sorry.

                          BEN
           It's okay.

                          ALISON
           I'll be right back. We'll finish

           Thanks for warning me, man. I just
           walking into a fucking buzz saw! She
           rejected me! Because you, for some

                          BEN
           You know why she just rejected me?
           Because you're such a shitty husband,

           You screwed me, Dad, okay? You said
           everything was going to be fine and
           nothing is fine. Nothing is fine.

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           Ben, I've been divorced three times.
           Why would you listen to me?

                          BEN
           Because you were the only one giving
           me advice! And it was, it was terrible
           advice!

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           You can go around blaming everyone
           else, but in the end, until you take
           responsibility for yourself, none of
           this is going to work out.

           I don't know how to take
           responsibility for myself, okay? I
           didn't read the baby books!

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           You didn't read the books?

                          BEN
           I should smoke less pot. I don't know
           what to do! I'm an idiot! What, tell
           me what to do!

           HARRIS (O.S.)
           I don't know. I don't know. Ben, I

           Alison, thank you for coming in. I
           don't want to shock you, but know
           what's under that jacket. You're
           pregnant, have been for a while. From
           my count, you're right around eight
           months. And I don't know why you felt
           you couldn't tell us.

                          ALISON
           I'm really sorry.

                          JILL
           This is Hollywood. We don't like
           liars.

                          ALISON
           I just wasn't expecting this and, I
           didn't know how to handle it, and I
           didn't want to lose my job. I'm really
           sorry.

                          JACK
           It's unfortunate that you didn't tell
           us because you would've found out that
           we thought it's great.

          Yeah.

                          JACK
          So, we did some research. And turns
          out, people like pregnant.

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God!

                          JACK
          The bigger you are, the bigger your
          numbers.

                          JILL
          I was surprised because I feel the
          opposite.

                          JACK
          We're going to do a whole maternity
          month on "E, Exclamation, Mommy."
          You're going to interview all the
          pregnant celebs.

                          ALISON
          Really?

                          JACK
          Yes.

                          JILL
          Scary!

                          JACK
          If you're pregnant, they're pregnant,
          you can talk about being pregnant.

                          JILL
          It just grosses me out...when I know
          that people are pregnant. Because I
          think about the birth. Everything's so
          wet.

                          JACK
          And everything that goes into it. None
          of the gross stuff. But you know,
          hopes, dreams, whatever. It's going to
          be great.

                          ALISON
          Oh, my God. This is such good news.
          Thank you so much.

                          JACK
          You're welcome. And then, after the
          baby is out, tighten it back up.

                          JILL
          Tight. And please don't lie to us
          again. Because maybe someday we could
          be friends.

           Help me stay relaxed.

                          BEN
           So, what should I do?

                          ALISON
           You need to call Dr. Howard.
          Ben goes into the hall and calls Dr. Howard's house.

                         

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE

          Dr. Howard's housekeeper, MARIA, answers the phone.

                          MARIA
           Hello?

                         

          INT. DEBBIE AND PETE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM


                          BEN
           Hello, this is Ben Stone. I'm calling
           on behalf of Alison Scott. We need Dr.
           Howard. It's an emergency.

                         

          INT. DR. HOWARD'S HOUSE


                          MARIA
           He's at San Francisco at Bar Mitzvah.

                         INTERCUT:

                          BEN
           He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San
           Francisco? Do you know when he gets
           back?

                          MARIA
           In three days.

                          BEN
           Do you have his cell number, by any
           chance?
          Ben pops his head around the corner to talk to Alison.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

                          (TO ALISON)
           Hey! Good news. I got his number right
           here. I'm going to call him right now.

                          ALISON
           Great. Thank you so much. I'm so glad
           you're here. Thank you.

           KNOCKED UP - 122.

                         

                          BEN
           I'm glad I'm here, too. Thank you. I
           shouldn't have told you you were a
           fucking lunatic. I shouldn't have said
           that. I feel terrible about it.

                          ALISON
           No, it's okay. We're past it. I'm
           sorry I told you to fuck your bong.

                          BEN
           It's okay. I didn't

                          ALISON
           Let's just drop it now. We're over it.

                          BEN
           I'm going to call him right now.
           You're doing so great.
          Ben slips into the hallway and calls Dr. Howard.

           DR. HOWARD (O.S.)
           Hello, it's Dr. Howard. I'm not here
           right now. Please leave a message.

                          BEN
           (into the phone)
           Hey, Doc Howard. Ben Stone calling.
           Guess what the fuck's up? Alison's
           going into labor and you are not
           fucking here. Now, where are you?
           You're at a fucking Bar Mitzvah in San
           Francisco, you motherfucking piece of
           shit! And you know I'm going to have
           to do now? I'm going to have to kill
           you. I'm going to have to pop a cap in
           your ass. You're dead! You're Tupac!
           You are fucking Biggie, you piece of
           shit! I hope you fucking die or drop
           the fucking chair and kill that
           fucking kid! Hope your plane crashes.
           Peace, fucker!
          Ben goes back to Alison.

                          ALISON
           Hey.

                          BEN
           Hey.

                          ALISON
           Did you talk to him?

                          BEN
           I didn't talk to him directly, I left
           him a very nice message, though. What
           I'm about to tell you isn't that bad.
           You should know that going in. We can
           get through this and it's just a
           little hiccup, but everything will be
           fine. Do you trust me when I say
           everything will be fine?

           KNOCKED UP - 123.

                         

                          ALISON
          I can deal with it.

                          BEN
          Okay. So, Dr. Howard is at a Bar
          Mitzvah.

                          ALISON
          A Bar Mitzvah?

                          BEN
          It's a Jewish rite of passage. And
          he's going to be there for the next
          three days, so he will not be able to
          be here tonight.

                          ALISON
          It's okay. What do you think we should
          do?

                          BEN
          I know exactly what to do. All we do
          is we'll get in the car, I'll drive to
          the hospital, and on the way, we will
          call every gynecologist we've met.
          Someone will be available. You know?

                          ALISON
          I can do that.

                          BEN
          Good. We still have time. I mean, how
          far apart are your contractions?

                          ALISON
          I think, like, seven minutes.

                          BEN
          Seven minutes! See? Not until four
          minutes is it really coming. And has
          your water broken, even?

                          ALISON
          I don't know. I'm in the tub.

                          BEN
          That's a good point. Have you had,
          have you had your bloody show?

                          ALISON
          What's that?

                          BEN
          It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it
          only comes out right before the baby's
          going to come, so if that hasn't
          happened, we have time. We can make it
          to the hospital. It's no problem.

                          ALISON
          You read the baby books.

                          BEN
          Yeah. I did. I read three of them,
          actually.

           KNOCKED UP - 124.

                         

                          ALISON
           Thank you.

                          BEN
           You're welcome.

                         

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

          Ben drives Alison's car. They park in a handicapped spot.

                          ALISON
           Wait. Are we allowed to park here?

                          BEN
           It's okay.
          Ben takes a handicapped placard out of his jacket pocket and hangs
          it on the mirror.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           I stole this from Martin's grandma.

                          ALISON
           Oh. That was really sweet of you.

                          BEN
           Thanks.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - FRONT DESK

          Alison and Ben approach the desk. A male nurse, SAMUEL, and a
          FEMALE NURSE tend to them.

                          BEN

                          (TO ALISON)
           We're close. Home stretch.
           (to Female Nurse)
           Hello. This is Alison Scott. Dr. Kuni
           said he would let you know we were
           coming?

                          FEMALE NURSE
           He did. We'll take good care of you.
           Samuel?

                          SAMUEL
           Yeah?

                          FEMALE NURSE
           This is Alison Scott. Please admit her
           into room 307.

                          SAMUEL
           All right. Hi.

                          BEN
           You're our nurse?

                          SAMUEL
           That's why I'm holding the clipboard.
           So, uh, what else is up with you guys?

           KNOCKED UP - 125.

                         
          Ben and Alison stare at Samuel.

                          SAMUEL (CONT'D)
           I'm just joking. Let's have a baby!

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Samuel is adjusting Alison's IV.

                          SAMUEL
           So, I'm sorry it took me so long to
           find that vein. That little guy really
           didn't want me to find him.

                          ALISON
           Is that the baby on that one right
           there?
          Alison points to some equipment by her bed side.

                          SAMUEL
           Yeah. That's how we can tell how the
           little guy or gal is doing.

                          ALISON
           Okay.
          A groggy Dr. Kuni enters.

           DR. KUNI
           Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night.

                          BEN
           We really, really appreciate you
           coming, man.

           DR. KUNI
           What else do I have to do, I mean,
           besides sleep? I was only kidding.
           What happened to your doctor?

                          BEN
           He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San
           Francisco. He didn't tell us though.

           DR. KUNI
           Nice.

                          BEN
           Yeah.

           DR. KUNI
           Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish
           friends.

                          ALISON
           Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this
           naturally. I don't want to use drugs.

           DR. KUNI
           Let's just take a look and see what
           happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is
           good. Samuel, where are we?

           KNOCKED UP - 126.

                         

                          SAMUEL
           Four centimeters.

           DR. KUNI
           Four centimeters what?

                          SAMUEL
           Dilated.

           DR. KUNI
           Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay
           attention, okay? We're a team. Okay?

          Jonah, Jason, Jay and Martin sit in the waiting room.

           I want to get the fuck out of here.

                          JAY
           What?

                          JONAH
           I just want to get the fuck out of
           here.

           Just relax, man, just relax.

                          JONAH
           I don't fucking like hospitals.

                          JAY
           Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think
           you need to relax and embrace the
           beauty of another life joining our
           gang. We're having a baby. We are
           having a baby.

                          JONAH
           I'm not having shit besides a fucking
           panic attack. There's probably a
           fucking room back there full of dead
           bodies! You guys want to be here when
           one rolls out and just fucking coughs
           malaria into our face?

                          JAY

           Is that good?

           KNOCKED UP - 127.

                         

                          ALISON
           Oh, yeah, get in there.

                          BEN
           I could do this all day.
          The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP.

                          ALISON
           What was that?

                          BEN
           What the hell was that?
          Samuel hurries in to check the monitor.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What's that, what's happening?
          Dr. Kuni enters.

           DR. KUNI
           Well, boy and girls, what seems to be
           the problem?

                          SAMUEL
           Decels.

           DR. KUNI
           Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to
           turn on your back now, okay? The
           baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay?

                          BEN
           It's going to be okay.
           (to Dr. Kuni)
           Is it going to be fine?
          Alison turns onto her back.

           DR. KUNI
           It's going to be fine. Okay?

                          (TO ALISON)
           You're going to feel a little bit of a
           push.
          Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby.

                          BEN
           What are you doing?

           DR. KUNI
           I'm turning the baby so I can take the
           pressure off the cord.

                          ALISON
           Oh, my God.
          The monitors stops beeping.

           KNOCKED UP - 128.

                         

           DR. KUNI
           We're good. The heartbeat's stronger,
           but we're not out of the woods. We
           need to get things going now. I think
           the cord is wrapped around the neck.
           Okay?

                          BEN
           What?

           DR. KUNI
           So I'm going to give you some
           medicine, pop the bag and get things
           going, okay? I don't want to leave the
           baby in there for long and we can give
           you some medicine for the pain.

                          ALISON
           No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby
           to be born all drugged out. It's not
           my birth plan.

           DR. KUNI
           Now, things change. We don't have time
           to debate this.

                          ALISON
           What? No. But no, I'm not comfortable
           with that. I'm not.

                          BEN
           No. Would you please just listen to
           her?

           DR. KUNI
           Fine. Do what you want to do.

                          BEN
           Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?

           DR. KUNI
           Should I leave? Do you want to be the
           doctor? Because I really don't need to
           be here.

                          BEN
           No. What we want is to take a second
           to talk about our options, okay?
           That's all we want.

           DR. KUNI
           No. You mean you want to take a second
           to tell me how to do my job. My job is
           to get that baby out safely. Or I can
           go home! You just let me know. You be
           the doctor.

                          BEN
           Can we talk outside in the hall for a
           second?

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

          Ben and Dr. Kuni stand in the hallway.

           KNOCKED UP - 129.

                         

           DR. KUNI
           That woman is a control freak, and she
           needs to let go and let me do my job.

                          BEN
           Look, she's just having a hard time
           because her and her doctor had a very
           specific birth plan. And they wanted
           it to be a very special experience.

           DR. KUNI
           Okay. if you want a special
           experience, go to a Jimmy Buffet
           concert. We have a new birth plan: Get
           the baby out safely.

                          BEN
           Look, man, will you help us out? I
           have no idea what I'm doing. You can
           be as big a dick to me as you want.
           Just be nice to her, man. That's all I
           ask. Just please be nice to her.
          Ben's stomach GROWLS loudly.

           DR. KUNI
           Are you okay?

                          BEN
           I think so.

           DR. KUNI
           I'm sorry. Let's start fresh.

                          BEN
           Thank you, man.

           DR. KUNI
           This is healthy. This is good. I think
           we're bonding.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          Dr. Kuni and Ben come back into the room.

           DR. KUNI
           Alison, I apologize for being a little
           brash, but if you're okay with it,
           it's rather important we break the bag
           and give you some medicine to speed
           things up. Because once the bag is
           broken, I don't want there to be an
           infection.

                          ALISON
           Whatever. Do what you have to do.
          Dr. Kuni exits.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           (whispering to Ben)
           Oh, my God. What a nightmare that guy
           is.

           KNOCKED UP - 130.

                         

                          BEN
           I know, I know. Look, I talked to him.
           I think he'll be more cool now.

                          ALISON
           I'm so sorry I broke up with you.

                          BEN
           You really don't need to be. And you
           know, I knew you'd give me another
           shot. I figured it'd be a lot sooner
           than this, you know?

                          ALISON
           I was just in such a panic from all of
           this. And watching Debbie and Pete
           together, and my ass got so fat.

                          BEN
           No, no.

                          ALISON
           It did. I just never, for one minute,
           thought that the guy who got me
           pregnant would actually be the right
           guy for me.

                          BEN
           Me neither.

                          ALISON
           I guess he is.

           Hi. I can't believe I go out of town
           and this happens.

                          ALISON
           I know.

                          DEBBIE
           I'm sorry, but I'm not going anywhere.

                          ALISON
           Screw Legoland.

                          PETE
           All right, how do you want this? You
           want this over the shoulder? I can do
           whatever you want. I can get in there.
           Kind of Spike Lee angles.

                          ALISON
           No, you can shoot the waiting room.
           That would be great.

                          DEBBIE

                          (TO BEN)
           Well, thank you. I've got it from
           here.

                          ALISON
           Debbie.

           Can I talk to you in the hall for a
           second?

                          DEBBIE
           Why?

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY

          Ben and Debbie talk in the hallway alone.

                          BEN
           I'd like to be in there with
           Alison...without you.

                          DEBBIE
           Okay. I understand how you feel, but
           this isn't up to you.

           KNOCKED UP - 132.

                         

                          BEN
           Look, Debbie, you are high off your
           ass if you think you're coming into
           that room. If you take one step
           towards that door, I will tell
           security there's a crazy chick in a
           pink dress snatching up babies. Okay?
           So don't even try to come into that
           room. That's my room now. That little
           area with the Pepsi machine...that's
           your area. My room. Your area. Stay in
           your area. Stay out of my room. Back
           the fuck off.

           What are you doing here?

                          DEBBIE
           He just kicked me out. He told me to
           leave. But I guess it's good, right?
           He said he's going to take care of
           her. He really seems on his game. I
           think he's going to be a good dad. I
           think I like him. Thank God.

           Go! Holy shit, almighty! Oh, shit,
           this really hurts!

           DR. KUNI
           Ah, I see we're well on our way.

                          ALISON
           I want the epidural! Okay? Give me the
           epidural!

                          BEN
           Give it to her. Give her the epidural,
           okay?

                          ALISON
           Okay?

                          BEN
           Give it to her now.

           DR. KUNI
           Alison, we're past the point of an
           epidural. The cervix is fully dilated.

           KNOCKED UP - 133.

                         

                          ALISON
           No, seriously, I want an epidural! I
           know there's time!

           DR. KUNI
           We can't give you the epidural.

                          ALISON
           Take the time! I'll make sure it
           doesn't come out! I'll stop pushing.

                          BEN
           We have time.

                          ALISON
           I'll stop, oh, please, please, please!

                          BEN
           Just do it, please!

           DR. KUNI
           I'm sorry. We have no time. We're
           going to just have to do this the all
           natural way, okay? The way you wanted
           to do it. Okay? Ready?

                          ALISON
           Okay.

           DR. KUNI
           Here comes another contraction, okay?
           I want you to push. Okay, ready? Good,
           good, good.

                          ALISON
           I feel everything! Oh, my God! It's
           happening.

                          SAMUEL
           Maybe we can take it down just a
           little. I think you're going to scare
           the other pregnant women.

                          ALISON
           Are you fucking kidding me? Are you

           wrong in there.

                          JASON
           No, no. I mean, granted, gynecology's
           only a hobby of mine, but it sounds to
           me like she's crowning. Is that right,
           Deb?

           KNOCKED UP - 134.

           Yeah. That's what it sounds like for
           everyone. Everyone goes through this.

                          JAY
           No, I disagree with you. That sounds
           terrible. I'm going to go sneak a
           peek, see if there's anything I can
           do.
          Jay goes to Alison's room.

           DR. KUNI
           It's crowning! I'm seeing the head!

                          ALISON
           Oh, God. Honey, what does it look
           like, Ben?
          Been peers down between Alison's legs.
          We actually see the crowning shot as the baby's head is being
          pushed out of Alison's vagina.

                          BEN
           Oh, God.

                          ALISON
           What?

                          BEN
           You don't want to see it. You don't

                          WANT--

                          ALISON
           No, I want to see it!

                          BEN
           It's beautiful. You don't want to,
           though.

                          ALISON
           No, I want to see...
          A nurse holds a mirror for Alison. She sees the actual crowning
          shot.

                          ALISON (CONT'D)
           ...it! Oh, God! Oh, God!

                          JAY
           One sec.

                          JONAH
           What did it look like?

                          JAY
           I shouldn't have gone in there. Don't
           go in there. Promise me you don't go
           in there.

                          JONAH
           Me go in there? That's the last
           fucking place I want to go. Like I'm
           going to go in there. Try getting a
           boner now.
          Jason beams at Debbie.

           What's up Deb?

           Hey.
          Pete looks at Debbie.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

          The birth is still in progress.

           DR. KUNI
           Push. One, two, three.

           Oh, God!

           DR. KUNI
           You've passed the shoulders. One more
           big push. Good.
          The baby comes out. Dr. Kuni cleans it up.

           KNOCKED UP - 136.

           Oh, Ben. I did it.

                          BEN
           You did it.

                          ALISON
           It's out.

                          BEN
           You did it. Oh, my God, you did it.
          Dr. Kuni hands the baby to Alison.

                          ALISON
           Hi, baby. I love you, Ben.

           I love you so much, too. Oh, my God.

           DR. KUNI
           Congratulations, you two. Beautiful.

                          ALISON
           Thank you.

           DR. KUNI
           You did so great. You were amazing.

                          ALISON
           Pretty baby.

                          BEN
           You got out. You made it out. Welcome.

           at your balls?

           I bet you do, late John Lennon.

           Who is that? Is that Ben's rabbi? Is
           he the one who cuts the penis?

                          PETE
           I think it's Matisyahu.

                          MARTIN
           Awesome.

                          JASON
           You want out of the bet?

                          MARTIN
           I want out of the bet.

           You know what you have to say. Just
           say it, man. I think now is the time.

                          MARTIN
           "Jason, you're the master."

                          JASON
           You heard it, right?

                          JAY
           Yeah.

                          JASON
           All right. You're out of the bet.
           You're done.
          Martin hugs Jason.

                          JASON (CONT'D)
           Your face smells like an old man's
           balls.

          Debbie and Pete come to check in on Alison.

           Oh, my God. Hello. My goodness. She's
           beautiful. She's beautiful. I love
           you, Ben.

           We're going to have another baby.

                          PETE
           Okay.
          Pete turns the camera on himself and shakes his head "no."

                          DEBBIE
           Hello, baby.

           Gentlemen, it's a girl!

                          THE GUYS
           Ohhhhhhh!

                          BEN
           Yeah!

           KNOCKED UP - 138.

                         
          They all hug.

           We got a daughter! Mazel Tov!

           Congratulations, Daddy!

                          BEN
           Let's meet her! She's awesome.

           A beautiful little girl!

           Let's meet her. Aw.

                         

          INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

          Alison sleeps while Ben holds the baby. Everyone else has gone
          home.

                          BEN
           (to the baby)
           And then your mommy said, "Just do it,
           already," which was very confusing to
           Daddy. So I listened to the most
           literal translation of that and I just
           did it, already. What would you do?
           Don't tell Mommy, but it was the
           smartest thing I ever did, listening
           to her, because now you're here. Isn't
           that nice? I think it is.

                         

          EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

          Ben and a Nurse push Alison and the baby in a wheelchair.

                         

          I/E ALISON'S CAR
          Ben drives while Alison and the baby are in the back seat.

                          ALISON
           I hope your apartment's big enough for
           the three of us.

                          BEN
           It definitely is. That's why I got one
           in East LA. The rent. It's huge! The
           only thing is we have to decide if
           we're going to be Crips or Bloods
           before we get there.

                          ALISON
           Well, I look good in red.

           KNOCKED UP - 139.

                         

                          BEN
           I look good in blue. The fighting
           continues. We could just throw off
           everyone and become Latin Kings.

                          ALISON
           Yeah.

                          BEN
           We both look good in gold.

                          ALISON
           Good choice. I would yell at you about
           driving so slow, except the baby's
           here.

                          BEN
           No, these guys can honk all they want.
           I ain't going faster than twelve. It
           might take us around three hours to
           get home, though.
          The car moves slowly down the highway with a line of cars waiting
          behind them.

          FADE OUT.

          EXT. VALLEY -- DAY
          
          A MYSTERIOUS WARRIOR treks across the rugged landscape.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     Legend tells of a legendary warrior
                     whose Kung Fu skills were the stuff
                     of legend.
          
          The warrior, his identity hidden beneath his flowing robe and
          wide-brimmed hat, gnaws on a staff of bamboo.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     He traveled the land in search of
                     worthy foes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. BAR
          
          The warrior sits at a table drinking tea and gnawing on his
          bamboo. The door BLASTS open. The MANCHU GANG rushes in and
          surrounds him.
          
                                GANG BOSS
                         (to warrior)
                     I see you like to CHEW!
                         (beat)
                     Maybe you should chew on my FIST!!
          
          The Boss punches the table.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     The warrior said nothing for his
                     mouth was full. Then, he swallowed.
          
          He swallows.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     And then, he spoke.
          
                               WARRIOR
                         (dubbed hero voice)
                     Enough talk. Let's FIGHT!
                     SHASHABOOEY!
          
          WHAM! The warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes
          flying.
          
                               NARRATOR (V.O.)
                     He was so deadly in fact that his
                     enemies would go blind from
                     overexposure to pure awesomeness.
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
          The gang members blindly flail about.
          
                                NINJA CAT
                    MY EYES!
          
                              GATOR
                    HE'S TOO AWESOME!
          
          ONLOOKERS swoon.
          
                              SMITTEN BUNNY
                    And ATTRACTIVE!
          
                              GRATEFUL BUNNY
                    How can we repay you??
          
                              WARRIOR
                    There is no charge for awesomeness,
                    or attractiveness.
          
          ONE HUNDRED ASSASSINS appear and surround the warrior.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The entire bar swells, packed to the rafters with ninjas.
          
                                WARRIOR
                    KABLOOEY!
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. BAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The roof EXPLODES and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky.
          Like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.)
                    It mattered not how many foes he
                    faced. They were no match for his
                    bodacity.
          
          The warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final
          blow while doing a split between two trees.
          
          The warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god-
          rays shine down upon him.
          
                              NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Never before had a panda been so
                    feared... and so loved.

                                NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                      Even the most heroic heroes in all
                      of China, the Furious Five, bowed
                      in respect to this great master.
          
                                MONKEY
                      We should hang out.
          
                                 WARRIOR
                      Agreed.
          
          As the Five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits
          approaching. The Five strike an attack pose. The warrior
          brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain
          into the sea of bandits.
          
                                NARRATOR (V.O.)
                      But hanging out would have to wait.
                      `Cause when you're facing the ten
                      thousand demons of Demon Mountain,
                      there's only one thing that
                      matters. And that's--
          
          In mid air, the Five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.
          
                                MONKEY

          INT. PO'S ROOM - DAY
          
          Po lands hard on the floor. He tries to clear his head and
          wake up.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                      Po! Get up!
          
          We see his room is filled with various kung fu posters
          (including a poster featuring all of the Five) and souvenirs,
          and a wooden version of the Sword of Heroes (the green
          sword).
          
          Po SIGHS.
          
          He attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly
          is too worthy a foe.
          
                                PO'S DAD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                      Po! What are you doing up there?
          
                                                                      4.

                    Uh, nothing!
          
          Po hops to his feet, imitating his Kung Fu action figures.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper!
                    Tigress! Rowrrrr...
          
          OUTSIDE on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig
          watering flowers stares at Po. Po tries to play it cool and
          then quickly ducks out of sight.
          
                              PO'S DAD (O.S.)
                    Po! Let's go! You're late for work!

          He takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the
          wall. It bounces off.
          
          He throws the star again, but it bounces off again. He picks
          it up and heads downstairs. He trips and falls the rest of
          the way.
          
          
          INT. KITCHEN - DAY
          
          Po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. A panda-
          shaped shadow looms over Po.
          
                              PO
                    Sorry, Dad.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Sorry doesn't make the noodles.
          
          Reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being
          carried by a small DUCK. This is PO'S DAD. Po gets to work,
          which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a
          panda his size.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What were you doing up there? All
                    that noise.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, nothing. Just had a crazy
                    dream.
          
          He gets back to work.
          
                                                                      5.

                    About what?
          
                               PO
                    Huh?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    The dream. What were you dreaming
                    about?
          
                              PO
                    What was I... eh, I was dreaming
                    about uh... heh...
          
          Push in on Po -- is he going to admit his dream? He hides his
          throwing star behind his back.
          
                               PO (CONT'D)
                    Noodles.
          
          THOK. Dad stops chopping vegetables.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Noodles. You were really dreaming
                    about noodles?
          
                              PO
                    Uh, yeah. What else would I be
                    dreaming about?
          
          Po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his
          throwing star is sitting in it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (to customer)
                    Careful, that soup is... sharp!
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Oh, happy day! My son, finally
                    having the noodle dream!
          
          He throws his arms around Po.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    You don't know how long I have been
                    waiting for this moment.
          
          When Dad pulls out of the hug, Po is now wearing a noodle
          apron.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    This is a sign, Po!
          
                                                                   6.
          
          
          Po looks at the apron nervously -- what has he gotten himself
          into?
          
                              PO
                    Uh...a sign of what?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    You are almost ready to be
                    entrusted with the secret
                    ingredient of my "Secret Ingredient
                    Soup." And then you will fulfill
                    your destiny and take over the
                    restaurant, just as I took it over
                    from my father, who took it over
                    from his father, who won it from a
                    friend in a game of mahjong.

                              PO'S DAD
                    No, it was the dream. We are noodle
                    folk. Broth runs through our veins.
          
                              PO
                    But Dad, didn't you ever, I dunno,
                    want to do something else?
                    Something besides noodles?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Actually...
          
          Po looks surprised.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    When I was young and crazy...
          
          Dad gets a wistful look in his eyes.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    I thought about running away and
                    learning how to make tofu.

                    Oh, because it was a stupid dream.
                    Can you imagine, me making tofu?
                        (laughs at the thought)
                    No. We all have our place in this
                    world. Mine is here. And yours is--

                    No, it's at tables two, five,
                    seven, and twelve.
          
          He loads Po's arms with bowls of soup.

                    Service with a smile!
          
          A GONG sounds in the distance. Po looks out the window at the
          distant JADE PALACE.
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAY
          
          SLAM ZOOM in towards Palace.
          
          End next to palace on an old red panda (SHIFU) playing a
          FLUTE. He is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle
          between the Palace buildings.
          
          Wider: We dolly around from behind the bushes. Stealthy dark
          shapes move in the foreground.
          
          Back on Shifu, still playing. He seems oblivious.
          
          Five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously,
          diving on Shifu.
          
          Shifu moves like lightning - the flute now wielded like a
          staff - he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries - the attackers
          go flying -
          
          They roll and pick themselves up, turning to face Shifu, who
          is now standing - poised - ready for their next move.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Well done, students... if you were
                    trying to disappoint me.
          
          He uses his flute to correct the Five's technique.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Tigress, you need more ferocity.
                    Monkey, greater speed.
          
          Each of the Five bows respectfully as their name is
          mentioned.
          
                                                                      8.
          
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Crane - height. Viper - subtlety.
                    Mantis--
          
          Shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared PALACE GOOSE.
          
                              ZENG
                    Master Shifu!
          
                              SHIFU
                        (impatiently)
                    What?!
          
                              ZENG
                        (startled)
                    Aah! It's Master Oogway. He wants
                    to see you.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned.
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY
          
          Shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined
          with palace geese.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - DAY
          
          Candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. The door bursts
          open, the candles flicker. Shifu enters.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master Oogway? You summoned me.
          
          He bows. Then looks up without unbowing.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Is something wrong?
          
          Reveal Master Oogway... a wise, old tortoise.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Why must something be wrong for me
                    to want to see my old friend?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So... nothing's wrong?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, I didn't say that.
          
          Shifu looks up, concerned. Oogway opens his mouth... and
          blows out a candle. And another candle. And another.
          
                                                                     9.
          
          
          Finally, Shifu uses his Kung Fu to blow them all out. Oogway
          smiles knowingly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were saying?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I have had a vision... Tai Lung
                    will return.
          
          Shifu looks stricken.
          
          
          FLASHBACK - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Quick, impressionistic images of Shifu battling a large,
          shadowy figure (Tai Lung).
          
          
          PRESENT - INT. SCROLL ROOM
          
          Shifu is rattled. He looks at the claw marks that still scar
          the wall and quickly looks away. But he regains his
          composure.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is impossible. He is in
                    prison.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Nothing is impossible.
          
          Shifu makes a split decision.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Zeng!
          
          He comes flying in. Shifu gets in his face.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Fly to Chogun Prison and tell them
                    to double the guards, double their
                    weapons. Double everything! Tai
                    Lung does not leave that prison!
          
                              ZENG
                    Yes, Master Shifu.
          
          The goose flies off, but... SMACK! He hits a column. Then he
          is off. Back on Oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from
          Shifu.
          
                                                                   10.

                    One often meets his destiny on the
                    road he takes to avoid it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    We have to do something. We can't
                    just let him march on the valley,
                    and take his revenge! He'll, he'll--
          
          Oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Your mind is like this water, my
                    friend. When it is agitated, it
                    becomes difficult to see. But if
                    you allow it to settle, the answer
                    becomes clear.
          
          Shifu and Oogway stare into the pool. Oogway settles the
          water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved
          dragon clutching a SCROLL in its mouth.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The Dragon Scroll...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    It is time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But who? Who is worthy to be
                    trusted with the secret to
                    limitless power? To become...the
                    Dragon Warrior?!
          
          Dramatic music as we push in on Oogway's face. Then...
          
                              OOGWAY
                    I don't know.
          
          
          INT. NOODLE SHOP - DAY

          A couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a
          palace pig hits a tiny gong. This gets Po's attention. He

          PAN DOWN a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. Po stands
          at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the
          daunting task before him.
          
          Po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs.

          Po watches as they run up the stairs. His eyes narrow. This
          is his heroic moment.

          Oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a Palace
          Pig bangs a gong.

                    Yes, and one I feared I would not
                    live to see. Are your students

                    Yes, Master Oogway.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Now know this, old friend. Whomever
                    I choose will not only bring peace
                    to the Valley, but also to you.
          
          As Shifu contemplates what this could mean, Oogway starts
          walking off. Shifu quickly joins Oogway as they head towards
          the roaring crowd below. The pig bangs the gong.

          Po panics for a beat and then finds a window. He jumps and
          weakly struggles to pull himself up.
          
          Po struggles to peek through the window.

          Po's Dad rushes over and tries to blow out the fuse.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?
          
                              PO
                    What does it look like I'm doing?
                    Stop! Stop! I'm going to see the
                    Dragon Warrior!
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    But I don't understand. You finally
                    had the noodle dream.
          
          Po looks uneasy.
          
                              PO
                    I lied. I don't dream about
                    noodles, Dad!
          
          He looks at the fuse... almost all gone... Po holds onto the
          chair for dear life, closes his eyes, and braces himself for
          liftoff.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)

          Po finally opens his eyes...
          
          He's still on the ground. The fuse was a dud. Po falls face
          first into the dirt. He looks away, embarrassed. Po's Dad
          holds out his apron.
          
                                 PO'S DAD
                       Come on, son. Let's get back to
                       work.
          
                                  PO
                       Okay.
          
          Po sighs, starts to reach for the apron, then-- BOOM! The
          rockets ignite, propelling Po into the stadium wall.
          
                                 PO'S DAD
                       Oh! Come back!
          
          Po's rocket chair blasts him into the sky amid a shower of
          fireworks.
          
                                 CROWD
                       Oooh! Aaahh!
          
          Po climbs up and up...until the rockets die out and the chair
          loses power...
          
                                  PO
                       Uh oh...
          
          Oogway's arm sweeps down the line of the expectant Five... Po
          falls towards the center of the ring...
          
          The tension builds as the Five wait to see who will be
          picked. Then... SMASH!
          
          Po lands and kicks up a huge dirt cloud, obscuring the ring.
          
          
          INT. ARENA
          
          PO POV: He sees the Five looking down at him, appalled. Po
          comes round slowly, getting his bearings. He looks around and
          sees Oogway. Strangely, the old turtle is smiling.
          
                                 PO
                       What's going on? Where...uh? What
                       are you pointing--?
          
          He looks up. An awful realization starts to dawn. Po GULPS.
          He is desperately embarrassed.
          
                                                                   19.

                    see who the Dragon Warrior was.
          
          He tries to shuffle his butt out of there, mumbling
          apologies.
          
                              OOGWAY

          Po tries moving out of the way of Oogway's finger, but it
          keeps following him.
          
                               OOGWAY
                    You.

          Oogway grabs Po's hand and holds it up for all to see.
          
                              OOGWAY

                    WHAT????
          
          The pig bangs the gong.
          
          The crowd goes wild! They cheer! They scream! Confetti falls!
          A palanquin is carried past Shifu.
          
                                                                   20.

                    Stop! Wait! Who told you to--?
          
          Po stands there, utterly stunned, his mouth hanging open. He
          is abruptly lifted up out of shot.
          
          Cut to the Palace Geese straining.
          
          Po is being lifted with great effort on the palanquin. He is
          carried off. Shifu elbows his way urgently through the
          thronging crowd to get to Oogway.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Master Oogway, wait! That flabby
                    panda can't possibly be the answer
                    to... our problem. You were about
                    to point at Tigress. That thing
                    fell in front of her. That was just
                    an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
          Oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off-screen CRASH!
          
          The camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed
          under Po.
          
          Shifu looks at Oogway. Oogway just smiles.
          
          A squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists Po, the palanquin,
          and the Geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the
          Jade Palace. Stunned, Shifu watches them go.
          
          Behind him, the Five approach and bow.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Forgive us, Master. We have failed
                    you.
          
          Shifu spins around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. If the panda has not quit by
                    morning, then I will have failed
                    you.
          
          Confetti flutters through the air as the celebration
          continues around them.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          A huge prison is carved into the side of a frozen mountain.
          Fifteen stories of iron and rock. No windows. One door --
          locked, bolted and sealed tight. Rhinoceros guards in armor
          patrol the perimeter.
          
          Zeng, the palace goose, flies into frame and a Rhino Sentry
          spots him in the distance. He lands, sliding on the ice and
          crashing into the gate. The rhinos point their spears at him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Wait wait wait! I bring a message
                    from Master Shifu.
          
          CLANG! The doors creak open. The terrified goose peers in.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. PRISON -- A MOMENT LATER
          
                              COMMANDER
                    What?!?!
                        (reading)
                    "Double the guard?! Extra
                    precautions?! Your prison may not
                    be adequate!"
          
          The Goose is quaking in fear. Stern Rhinos surround him,
          staring daggers at him. The Commander snaps the scroll shut.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    You doubt my prison's security?
          
                               ZENG
                    Absolutely not.
                        (then)
                    Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    I'll give you a message for your
                    Master Shifu.
          
          
          ON A BRIDGE
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Escape from Chogun Prison is
                    impossible!
          
          The Goose is awed by the cavernous prison.
          
                                                                   22.
          
          
                                  ZENG
                       Whoa.
          
          The goose looks over the bridge's edge. The prison goes down
          a long ways. The commander hits the goose on the back.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Impressive, isn't it?
          
          A feather from the goose drifts down the prison.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, very impressive. It's VERY
                       impressive.
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       One way in, one way out, one
                       thousand guards, and one prisoner.
          
                                 ZENG
                       Yes, except that prisoner is Tai
                       Lung...
          
          
          AT THE ELEVATOR
          
                                 COMMANDER
                       Take us down.
          
          Several guard rhinos winch the goose and the commander down.
          The commander grabs the chain and shakes the elevator, trying
          to scare the goose.
          
                                 ZENG
                       What are you doing?!
          
          The commander just laughs. The elevator finally lands,
          sending an echo throughout the prison.
          
          AT DOORS -
          
          A number of doors unlock, one after the other. Finally, a
          drawbridge is lowered out onto an island.
          
                                  ZENG (CONT'D)
                       Oh my...

                       I'll um...I'm just gonna wait right
                       here.
          
                                                                  23.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    It's nothing to worry about. It's
                    perfectly safe.
          
          He shoves the goose out ahead of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Oof!
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Crossbows! At the ready!
          
                              ZENG
                    Crossbows?!
          
          They approach TAI LUNG, a giant, muscular snow leopard bound
          in a giant piece of tortoise shell armor and chains. He
          barely registers signs of life. The commander walks right up
          to him.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Hey, tough guy, did you hear?
                    Oogway's finally gonna give someone
                    the Dragon Scroll and it's not
                    gonna be you!
          
          The goose can't believe it.
          
                              ZENG
                    What are you doing?! Don't get him
                    mad.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    What's he gonna do about it? I've
                    got him completely immobilized.
          
          The Commander stomps on Tai Lung's tail. We hear a crunch.
          The goose flinches. But Tai Lung does not react.
          
                              COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                    Awww. Did I step on the witty
                    kitty's tail? Awww.
          
          Tai Lung doesn't move. His eyes stare coldly straight ahead.

                    I'm good. I've seen enough. I'm
                    gonna tell Shifu he's got nothing
                    to worry about.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    No, he doesn't.

                              ZENG
                    Okay, I'll tell him that. Can we
                    please go now?
          
          The Commander starts to walk back to the elevator. The goose
          hurries after him.
          
          The goose's feather flutters into frame. We follow the
          feather as it lands right in front of Tai Lung.
          
          HIS EYES OPEN. Tai Lung grabs the feather with his tail.

          Po points at a rather friendly-looking dummy.
          
                              SHIFU
                    That? We use that for training
                    children. And for propping the door
                    open when it's hot. But if you
                    insist...
          
          Relieved, Po turns to the dummy. The Five gather around him.
          
                                                                    30.

                    Whoa. The Furious Five. You're so
                    much bigger than your action
                    figures -- except for you, Mantis.
                    You're about the same.
          
          Mantis gives him a look.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Go ahead, panda. Show us what you
                    can do.

                    Um, are they gonna watch? Or should
                    I just wait until they get back to
                    work or something...
          
                              SHIFU
                    Hit it.

                    Ok. I mean, I just ate. So I'm
                    still digesting... So my kung fu
                    might not be as good as later on.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Just hit it.
          
          Po psyches himself up, doing some Jack Fu.

                    comin' at ya snikity-snake.
          
          Shifu and the Five stare at Po, perplexed.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Would you hit it!

                    Alright...alright.
          
          Po lightly hits the dummy and it rocks back into place.
          
                                                                  31.

                       harder...
          
          Po punches it again, knocking it all the way backwards. He
          turns to Shifu, smug.

                       How's tha--
          
          WHAP! The dummy rights itself and smacks Po. Totally dazed,
          Po trips and stumbles his way through the obstacle course.
          The Five instinctively step forward to help Po, but Shifu
          holds up his hand to stop them.

          A spiky tethered ball sends Po flying into the jade turtle
          exercise, where it rattles him around.
          
                                 SHIFU
                           (to the Five)

          The turtle spills him out and he stumbles into the army of
          wooden dummies.

          The last dummy whaps him in the crotch and everything becomes
          still.

          He struggles to get on his feet, takes one step and reaches
          out to a dummy arm...and immediately gets pummeled all over
          again. Po comes out the other side battered and bruised and
          finds he is standing on the floor that shoots out bursts of
          flame. We see reflections of fire on the Five and Shifu as Po
          gets singed. He comes crawling into frame.
          
                                                                  32.

          EXT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
          
          The Five are walking to the bunkhouse, which sits high on a
          hill.
          
                              MANTIS
                    There's no words.
          
                              CRANE
                    No denying that.

                    I don't understand what Master
                    Oogway was thinking. The poor guy's
                    just gonna get himself killed.
          
                              CRANE
                        (mocking)
                    He is so mighty! The Dragon Warrior
                    fell out of the sky on a ball of
                    fire.
          
                              MANTIS
                    When he walks, the very ground
                    shakes!
          
                              TIGRESS
                    One would think that Master Oogway
                    would choose someone who actually
                    knew Kung Fu.
          
                              CRANE
                    Yeah, or could at least touch his
                    toes.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Or even see his toes.
          
          As the others walk off, we reveal Po, who unbeknownst to them
          has been walking behind them this whole time, hearing
          everything.
          
          He attempts to look at his toes but just sees gut. He lifts
          up his stomach, leans forward... leans... leans... and falls
          over.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          He gets up and watches them go inside. He sighs.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE
          
          Po peeks around the corner.

                    Okay.
          
          He tip-toes into the hall.
          
          SQUEAK. The floorboards strain beneath him. SQUEAK.

          Po takes a gentle step. CRE-E-E-A-AA--CHUNK! Po's foot goes
          through the floor. Po tries to recover. SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK!
          THUNK! Po rolls his ankle and stumbles through a bedroom
          door.
          
          Crane is staring back at him.

          Po spins around, his face dripping with peach juice.

                    Is that what this is? I am so
                    sorry. I thought it was just a
                    regular peach tree.

                    I understand. You eat when you are
                    upset.

                              OOGWAY

                    I probably sucked more today than
                    anyone in the history of kung fu,
                    in the history of China, in the
                    history of sucking.

                    How's Shifu ever going to turn me
                    into the Dragon Warrior? I mean,
                    I'm not like The Five. I've got no
                    claws, no wings, no venom. Even
                    Mantis has those...
                        (he imitates a mantis'
                         front legs)
                    ...thingies. Maybe I should just
                    quit and go back to making noodles.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Quit, don't quit. Noodles, don't
                    noodles.
          
          Po looks confused.
          
                                                                  37.

                    You are too concerned with what was
                    and what will be. There is a
                    saying: Yesterday is history,
                    tomorrow is a mystery, but today is
                    a gift. That is why it is called
                    the present.
          
          Oogway hits the tree with his staff as he walks away and a
          peach falls into Po's open hand.
          
          
          INT. PRISON -- NIGHT
          
          Using the goose's feather to pick the lock, Tai Lung BURSTS
          free from his armor.
          
          An ALARM RINGS OUT!
          
          The Commander runs to the ledge, the Goose right behind him.
          
                              ZENG
                    What's happening?!
          
          The Goose looks over the edge and sees Tai Lung at the bottom
          of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung struggles with his shackles.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Fire Crossbows!
          
          Tai Lung uses the incoming spears to break his shackles and
          then manages to kick the spears back up into the walls,
          creating a makeshift staircase.
          
                              ZENG
                    Tai Lung is free! I must warn
                    Shifu!
          
          The Commander shuts the Goose up.
          
                              COMMANDER
                    You're not going anywhere. And
                    neither is he.
          
                              ZENG
                    Let go of me!
          
                              COMMANDER
                        (to guards)
                    Bring it up!
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
          The winch turns and the elevator starts to rise. A rhino
          guard tries to reach it, but just misses.
          
                              RHINO GUARD #1
                    Wait! Bring it back!
          
                              ZENG
                    He's coming this way!
          
                              COMMANDER
                    He won't get far.
                        (to guards)
                    Archers!
          
          Leaping across the spears, Tai Lung catches the elevator as
          the volley of arrows flies down past him.
          
          The guards cut the rope and the elevator crashes back down to
          the bottom of the pit.
          
          Tai Lung swings up from the bottom of the elevator house and
          catches the guards by surprise. He grabs the chain and jumps
          over the edge and swings around, launching himself up to the
          next tier, disappearing into the shadows.
          
          Tai Lung lands on a bridge, fights his way through, finally
          reaching the top tier where the Commander and the rest of the
          Rhino army await.
          
                              ZENG
                    We're dead. So very, very dead.
          
          The Commander hushes the Goose.
          
                              COMMANDER
                        (to Goose)
                    Heh heh...not yet we're not! Now!
          
          Archers set off charges on the ceiling. Massive stalactites
          crash down and the bridge begins to crumble. Tai Lung leaps
          across the crumbling debris and attempts one last huge jump
          towards the Commander. But he falls short, claws scraping and
          sparking against the rock wall. The Commander laughs
          maniacally.
          
          On his way down, Tai Lung looks up and sees a fuse burning
          down to the last group of explosives. He leaps across the
          raining debris up to the ceiling of the cavern.
          
          Grabbing a hold of the dynamite, Tai Lung falls and slings it
          ahead of him at the guards.
          
                              ZENG
                    Can we run now?
          
                                                                   39.
          
          
                              COMMANDER
                    Yes.
          
          
          EXT. PRISON
          
          KA-THOOM! The door blasts open and Rhinos go flying
          everywhere.
          
          WHUMP. The Goose hits the ground. The commander's horn
          prosthetic falls in front of him.
          
                              ZENG
                    Nuuu... Urggg...
          
          Tai Lung picks up the Goose by the throat.
          
                              ZENG (CONT'D)
                    URRK!
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I'm glad Shifu sent you. I was
                    beginning to think I had been
                    forgotten.
          
          With a creepy tenderness, Tai Lung smooths the Goose's
          ruffled feathers.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Fly back there and tell them...the
                    real Dragon Warrior is coming home.
          
          Tai Lung throws the Goose into the air and he flutters off.
          Lightning strikes.
          
                                                            CUT TO:

          CLOSE-UP of a gong being struck.
          
          
          INT. BUNKHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Shifu enters the hallway of the bunkhouse. The Five burst out
          of their rooms and land, ready for inspection.
          
                              FURIOUS FIVE
                    Good morning master!
          
          One door remains closed.

          He slides open Po's door. The room is empty.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)

                              SHIFU
                    All we can do is resume our
                    training and trust that in time,
                    the true Dragon Warrior will be
                    revealed.
          
          
          INT. JADE PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Shifu enters the training hall, only to find himself face-to-
          face with Po's butt. Shifu and the Five are taken aback.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What are you doing here?!
          
          Reveal Po is in the middle of the floor, his legs spread wide
          apart. Po looks back over his shoulder to see Shifu and the
          Five enter the hall.

                    You actually thought you could
                    learn to do a full split in one
                    night? It takes years to develop
                    one's flexibility and years longer
                    to apply it in combat.
          
          Shifu flings two boards into the air. Instantly, Tigress
          leaps up and executes a perfect split kick. Po is awestruck.
          As Tigress lands, the broken chunks of board land all around
          Po, knocking him on the head.
          
          Po collects a piece of splintered board as a souvenir. Shifu
          notices and steps forward.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Put that down! The only souvenirs
                    we collect here are bloody knuckles

                    I'm sorry, brother! I thought you
                    said you were ready!

          Shifu snaps.
          
          Monkey twirls a bamboo staff. He lunges at Po who takes a
          comical beating.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          Po and Crane prepare to spar atop the turtle bowl. CRASH. Po
          falls in and is tossed around like a sack of soup.
          
          Shifu snaps.
          
          We see a series of shots of Po falling on his face at the
          hands of some invisible opponent, who turns out to be...
          Mantis.
          
          Shifu smiles. Flat on his back, Po manages a salute. Shifu
          has had it.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I've been taking it easy on you,
                    panda, but no more! Your next
                    opponent... will be me.
          
          Po looks excited.

          The Five exchange worried looks.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (to Po)
                    Step forth.
          
          Po doesn't even finish the step as Shifu whirls him around
          and throws him to the floor pinning his arm behind him.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    The true path to victory is to find
                    your opponent's weakness and make
                    him suffer for it.

                    Oh, yeah!
          
          Shifu whips Po around again.
          
                              SHIFU
                    To take his strength and use it
                    against him.
          
          Again, this time Shifu holds Po by the nose.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --until he finally falls, or quits.
          
          Po is totally inspired.

                    But a real warrior never quits.
                    Don't worry, Master, I will never
                    quit!
          
          At his breaking point, Shifu flings Po into the air and then
          leaps at him with a flying kick.

                    Shifu found him as a cub. And he

          Baby Tai Lung pulls on Shifu's whiskers.

                    He believed in him. He told him he
                    was destined for greatness.
          
          Hard cut to a full-grown Tai Lung demolishing a training

                    It was never enough for Tai Lung.
                    He wanted the Dragon Scroll. But
                    Oogway saw darkness in his heart
                    and refused. Outraged, Tai Lung
                    laid waste to the valley. He tried
                    to take the scroll by force. And
                    Shifu had to destroy what he had
                    created.
          
          Tai Lung ransacks a village on his way up to the Jade Palace.
          He crashes through the doors, running towards a waiting Shifu
          and Oogway.
          
          Shifu leaps at Tai Lung to deliver a kick.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But how could he?
          
          Seeing only baby Tai Lung running towards him, Shifu pulls
          his kick short. Tai Lung counters with a devastating strike
          and Shifu crashes to the ground holding his broken leg.
          
          Tai Lung leaps for the scroll, but Oogway stops him with
          strikes at his pressure points. He falls to the ground in a
          heap.
          
                              TIGRESS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Shifu loved Tai Lung like he'd
                    never loved anyone before...
          
          Young Tigress in the training hall strikes the dummy in the
          same manner as Tai Lung. Shifu corrects her form. Nothing
          more. Young Tigress looks crestfallen.
          
                                                                     48.

          The sad, young Tigress cross-dissolves to adult Tigress.

                    you: a big, fat panda who treats it

          covered with needles.

                    And may have also stopped his
                    heart.
          
          
          INT. TRAINING HALL - NIGHT
          
          Shifu is sitting in meditation, fidgeting incessantly.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner
                    peace.
          
          He finally opens one eye.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Would whoever is making that
                    flapping sound, quiet down!
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
          Satisfied with the silence, Shifu nods and resumes his
          meditation.
          
                               SHIFU (CONT'D)

          BOOM. Zeng drops in from the ceiling.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Oh, Zeng. Excellent. I could use
                    some good news right now.
          
                               ZENG
                    Uh...

          EXT. JADE PALACE GROUNDS - EVENING
          
          Oogway stands under the peach tree, deep in thought. Shifu
          rushes in, emerging from the mist, extremely agitated.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master! Master!
          
                               OOGWAY
                    Hmmm?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (out of breath)
                    I have-- it's-- it's very bad news.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, Shifu. There is just news.
                    There is no good or bad.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Master, your vision...your vision
                    was right. Tai Lung has broken out
                    of prison. He's on his way!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    That is bad news...
          
          He turns to face Shifu and stares at him, eyebrow raised.
          
                              OOGWAY (CONT'D)
                    ...If you do not believe that the
                    Dragon Warrior can stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The panda? Master, that panda is
                    not the Dragon Warrior.

                    He wasn't even meant to be here --
                    it was an accident!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    There are no accidents.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Yes, I know. You've said that
                    already. Twice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Well, that was no accident either.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Thrice.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    My old friend, the panda will never
                    fulfill his destiny, nor you yours,
                    until you let go of the illusion of
                    control.
          
                                SHIFU
                    Illusion?
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Yeah. Look at this tree, Shifu. I
                    cannot make it blossom when it
                    suits me, nor make it bear fruit
                    before its time.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But there are things we can
                    control.
          
          Shifu kicks the tree and a peach falls to his feet.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    I can control when the fruit will
                    fall.
          
          A peach falls on his head and Oogway chuckles. Shifu tosses
          the peach in the air, leaps up, and splits it with a chop.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    And I can control--
          
          Shifu punches the ground, creating a hole and places the seed
          in it.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    --where to plant the seed. That is
                    no illusion, Master.
          
                                                                 51.
          
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Ah, yes. But no matter what you do,
                    that seed will grow to be a peach
                    tree. You may wish for an apple, or
                    an orange... but you will get a
                    peach.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Maybe it can. If you are willing to
                    guide it, to nurture it. To believe
                    in it.
          
          Oogway covers the seed with dirt.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But how? How? I need your help,
                    Master.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    No, you just need to believe.
                    Promise me, Shifu. Promise me you
                    will believe.
          
                              SHIFU
                    I... I will try.
          
          Oogway smiles, then glances up at the sky, then back down to
          Shifu.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    Good. My time has come. You must
                    continue your journey without me.
          
          He hands his staff to a confused Shifu.
          
                              SHIFU
                    What... what are you..?
          
          Oogway backs away into the swirling fog.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Master, you can't leave me!
          
          The petals surround Oogway as he approaches the cliff's edge.
          
                              OOGWAY
                    You must believe.
          
                              SHIFU

          Shifu runs after him. Oogway is engulfed by peach blossoms.
          As the winds settle, Shifu is revealed standing at the edge
          of a cliff.
          
          Oogway is gone.
          
          We pan across to the bunkhouse.

          Po laughs. He picks up his bowl and takes a giant gulp. When
          he lowers the bowl, we see a noodle hanging from his face --
          it looks like a moustache. Mantis snickers.

          Po looks at the stone-faced Five. Tigress jumps to her feet.
          
                              MONKEY
                    It's Shifu.

                    Of course it's Shifu. What do you
                    think I'm doing?
          
          He finally notices Shifu standing there, doing a slow burn.
          Embarrassed, he places the soup bowls on his chest like a
          bra.

          Po slurps up the noodle moustache. Monkey can't help but
          snicker.
          
                                                                  55.

          The bowls fall off. A beat as this sinks in... then Po starts
          to laugh.

          He dramatically points at Po... but Po is gone.

                    But it could never hurt more than
                    it did every day of my life just

          Tigress stands in the moonlight outside the palace. She has
          seen what just transpired between Shifu and Po.

          She turns away, a look of resolve on her face... and LEAPS.
          
          She flies through the air, finally landing on a rooftop in
          the valley below. She looks back up at the palace.
          
                              TIGRESS

          Night dissolves to dawn. Shifu sits under the peach tree. He
          stirs, hearing KUNG FU NOISES from the training hall. He goes
          to investigate.

          some amazing Kung Fu.
          
          Entering the kitchen, Shifu finds Po is stuffing his face
          with food. Seeing Shifu, he stops mid-munch.
          
          In silence they eye each other. Shifu surveys the room --
          broken lock, smashed doors, unhinged cabinets. Po belches.

                    shelf.
          
          Shifu calmly exits and hides just outside the doorway,
          waiting to see if his hunch is correct.
          
          KLUMP! KLONK! THUNK! Shifu peeks back inside and finds Po
          perched atop the high shelves jamming more cookies into his

          He and Po stare at each other for a beat. Then... WHOOMP! Po
          slips and crashes to the kitchen floor. A cookie rolls over
          to Shifu. He picks it up.

                    The Pool of Sacred Tears.
          
          Po quickly stops. Realizing.
          
                                                                 61.

                       The pool of...
          
                                 SHIFU
                       This is where Oogway unravelled the
                       mysteries of harmony and focus.
                       This is the birthplace of Kung Fu.
          
          The camera cranes up to reveal they are standing on rock
          shapes that resemble a yin yang symbol.
          
          As the camera pulls further out, it pulls back through a
          vision of Oogway doing Kung Fu moves.
          
          FLASH FRAME -- Shifu leaps atop one of the rocks and looks
          down at Po.
          
                                 SHIFU (CONT'D)
                       Do you want to learn Kung Fu?

                                 SHIFU
                       Then I am your master!

                       Okay!
          
          Tears of joy well up in Po's eyes.
          
                                    SHIFU
                       Don't cry.

                       Okay.
          
          Po sniffs the tears back and smiles.

          Shifu leads Po out into an open field.
          
                                 SHIFU
                       When you focus on Kung Fu, when you
                       concentrate...you stink.
          
          Po scowls.
          
                                                                 62.
          
          
                               SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    But perhaps that is my fault. I
                    cannot train you the way I have
                    trained the Five. I now see that
                    the way to get through to you is
                    with this!
          
          Shifu produces a bowl of dumplings.
          
                              PO
                    Oh great, `cause I'm hungry.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Good. When you have been trained,
                    you may eat. Let us begin.
          
          
          EXT. FIELD - LATER
          
          Po's training unfolds -- deep breathing exercises, balance
          tests, push ups, sit ups, climbing, etc. Through it all, he
          never gets to eat, although he does indeed learn kung fu.
          
          
          EXT. CLEARING - A MOMENT LATER
          
          Shifu sets a bowl of dumplings on a boulder.
          
                              SHIFU
                    After you, panda.
          
          Po stops short, suspicious.
          
                               PO
                    Just like that? No situps? No ten
                    mile hike?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I vowed to train you... and you
                    have been trained. You are free to
                    eat.
          
          Po grabs one of the dumplings in his chopsticks.
          
                               SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Enjoy.
          
          Po raises the dumpling to his mouth. WHOOSH! Shifu snatches
          the dumpling away and eats it himself.
          
                               PO
                    Hey!

                              SHIFU
                    I said you are free to eat. Have a
                    dumpling.
          
          Po reaches again as Shifu leaps across the table and kicks
          the dumpling into the air.
          
                               PO
                    Hey!
          
          Shifu eats it and Po scowls.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You are free to eat!
          
                              PO
                        (upset)
                    Am I?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (challenging)
                    Are you?!
          
          Po and Shifu ready their chopsticks. Po slams the table and
          sends the bowl of dumplings airborne. Back and forth, Po and
          Shifu spar, vying for the dumplings. Until there is only one
          left.
          
          Shifu tries every trick to keep the dumpling away from Po. He
          hides it underneath one of the bowls. He uses his chopsticks
          as weapons to smack Po's chopsticks away. He attacks Po with
          his bamboo staff.
          
          But Po skillfully manages to best Shifu for the final
          dumpling.
          
          Shifu smiles. Po has passed the final test.
          
          But then Po tosses the dumpling into Shifu's open hand.
          
                              PO
                    I'm not hungry... master.
          
          Master and pupil bow to each other.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS
          
          The Five race toward a rope bridge stretched between mountain
          peaks.
          
                                                                  64.
          
          
          Tai Lung appears at the other end of the bridge. He ROARS and
          races toward them.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Cut it!
          
          The others slash at the ropes securing the bridge to the
          mountain. Tai Lung is almost upon them when Tigress cuts the
          final rope. But Tai Lung is too close -- Tigress must launch
          herself into him. The two cats end up in the middle of the
          bridge just as it starts to tumble into the canyon below. The
          Five grab support ropes and hold on for dear life.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Where's the Dragon Warrior?
          
                              TIGRESS
                    How do you know you're not looking
                    at her?
          
          Tai Lung laughs. It echoes off the mountain walls.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You think I'm a fool? I know you're
                    not the Dragon Warrior. None of
                    you!
          
          The Five exchange quick, worried looks.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                        (nodding confidently)
                    I heard how he fell out of the sky
                    on a ball of fire, that he's a
                    warrior unlike anything the world
                    has ever seen.
          
          The Five exchange quick, confused looks.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Po?
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So that is his name -- Po. Finally,
                    a worthy opponent. Our battle will
                    be legendary!
          
          Tigress charges at him. The battle begins. Tigress punches
          Tai Lung as he hangs from the bridge. But Tai Lung counters
          with a maneuver that sends Tigress slamming backwards through
          the bridge's wooden slats. Then Tigress gets choked by the
          bridge's ropes. Monkey turns to Crane and Viper.
          
                              MONKEY
                    We've got this. Help her!
          
                                                                     65.
          
          
          Viper grabs Tai Lung, which causes him to let go of the
          ropes. Tigress plummets down into the gorge... but Crane
          manages to catch her. Viper punches Tai Lung repeatedly with
          his own fist. Tai Lung manages to get a paw around Viper's
          "throat".
          
                              VIPER
                    Monkey!
          
          ANGLE ON MANTIS AND MONKEY. Mantis is straining to hold the
          rope by himself.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Go!
                        (then)
                    Ack! What was I thinking?!
          
          Monkey leaps into action, kicking Tai Lung in the chest and
          sending him crashing through the slats of the bridge. He gets
          back to his feet and starts running back to them on a single
          strand of rope.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    Mantis!
          
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, sending a sine wave
          shooting toward Tai Lung. The rope whips Tai Lung in the face
          and he gets tangled up. The Five see their chance.
          
                              TIGRESS (CONT'D)
                    Now!
          
          Working as a team, the Five kick Tai Lung's butt every which
          way. Tigress finally slashes the last rope holding up Tai
          Lung. He plummets down... down... disappearing into the mist.
          Mantis whips his end of the rope, returning his buddies
          safely to the mountain.
          
          The Five look relieved. But the relief is short-lived...
          
          Tigress notices that the other end of the bridge is circling
          the far mountain peak. Her eyes go wide with dread. The rope
          whips up. But Tai Lung isn't there.
          
          With a crash, he suddenly appears behind the Five.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Shifu taught you well...
          
          Tai Lung jabs a finger at Monkey, who instantly freezes.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    But he didn't teach you everything.
          
                                                                     66.
          
          
          Tai lung lunges toward the rest.
          
          
          EXT. TRAINING HALL - EVENING
          
          Shifu and Po walk through the palace courtyard. Po has an
          easy spring in his step.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You have done well, Panda.
          
                              PO
                    Done well? Done well?! I've done
                    awesome!
          
          He swings his belly around and knocks Shifu off balance.
          
          Shifu staggers back, regaining his dignity.
          
                              SHIFU
                    The mark of a true hero is
                    humility!
          
          After a moment's thought, though, he leans toward Po -
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    But yes...you have done awesome.
          
          And he punches him playfully on the arm. Po smiles at him. As
          they LAUGH, an indistinct figure appears in the clouds behind
          them. IT'S CRANE!
          
          Crane carries the five to the palace grounds, crashing in a
          heap.
          
                              PO
                    Huh? Guys? Guys!
          
          Po throws his backpack aside and runs over to them.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    They're dead? No, they're
                    breathing! They're asleep?! No,
                    their eyes are open.
          
          Crane struggles to lift his head.
          
                              CRANE
                    We were no match for his nerve
                    attack.
          
          His head collapses to the ground.
          
                                                                  67.
          
          
                              SHIFU
                    He has gotten stronger.
          
                              PO
                    Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?
          
          Shifu starts freeing the Five. First Viper, then Mantis, then
          Monkey releases suddenly from his paralysis -
          
                              MONKEY
                    He's too fast!
          
          He delivers a Kung Fu punch to Po's head and then slowly
          realizes where he is.
          
                                 MONKEY (CONT'D)
                    Sorry, Po.
          
          Shifu kneels before Tigress and works to free her.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    I thought we could stop him.
          
                              SHIFU
                    He could have killed you.
          
                              MANTIS
                    Why didn't he?
          
                              SHIFU
                    So you could come back here and
                    strike fear into our hearts. But it
                    won't work!
          
                              PO
                    Uh, it might, I mean, a little. I'm
                    pretty scared.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You can defeat him, panda.
          
                              PO
                    Are you kidding? If they can't--
                    They're five masters. I'm just one
                    me.
          
                              SHIFU
                    But you will have the one thing
                    that no one else does.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
          INT. SCROLL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
          
          CLOSE-UP of the Dragon Scroll. Po stares at Shifu - then
          looks up at the Scroll. Then back at Shifu -
          
                              PO
                    You really believe I'm ready?
          
                              SHIFU
                    You are, Po.
          
          They look at each other. This is a big moment.
          
          Oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. As Po
          and The Five stand by, Shifu carries the staff over to the
          reflecting pool. Shifu bows his head, then, eyes still
          closed, he raises the staff up above his head. Po and the
          others watch, expectantly. The peach blossom petals rise in a
          flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. The gentle
          tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the
          Dragon Scroll. The petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's
          mouth and it falls. At the last second, Shifu reaches out
          with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. He turns
          to Po, holding it out.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Behold. The Dragon Scroll... It is
                    yours.
          
                              PO
                    Wait, what happens when I read it?
          
                               SHIFU
                    No one knows, but legend says you
                    will be able to hear a butterfly's
                    wing-beat.

                    Yes. And see light in the deepest
                    cave. You will feel the universe in
                    motion around you.

                    Focus. Focus.
          
                                                                  69.

                    Huh? Oh, yeah... yeah.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Read it, Po, and fulfill your
                    destiny. Read it and become... the
                    Dragon Warrior!
          
                                PO
                    Whooaa!!!
          
          Po takes a deep breath. Then he grasps the tube and tries to
          pull the top off it. It doesn't budge. He strains at it.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's impossible to open.
          
          He strains again. He tries to bite it off...
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Come on baby. Come on now...
          
          Shifu SIGHS and holds out his hand. Po passes him the tube.
          Shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to Po.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    Thank you. I probably loosened it
                    up for you though... Okay, here
                    goes.
          
          He glances at the Five. They look on in awe. Monkey gives him
          the `thumbs up.' Po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden
          light bathing his face. Across the scroll we see Shifu,
          excited that he is witness to history...
          
          On Po's face as he finishes opening the scroll.
          
          Then -
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
          
          Shifu looks concerned. The Five look concerned. Po looks
          utterly terrified.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                    It's blank!
          
                                SHIFU
                    What?
          
                              PO
                    Here! Look!
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Po tries to show Shifu the scroll. Shifu covers his eyes and
          turns his head away.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No! I am forbidden to look upon--
          
          But he can't help himself. He takes a peek. Then he GRABS if
          off Po. He turns it around, then upside down. He closes it
          and opens it again, astonished.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Blank? I don't...I don't
                    understand.
          
          Shifu turns away, contemplative. What can this mean?
          
                              PO
                    Okay. So like, Oogway was just a
                    crazy old turtle after all?
          
                              SHIFU
                    No. Oogway was wiser than us all.
          
          Po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.
          
                              PO
                    Oh, come on! Face it. He picked me
                    by accident. Of course I'm not the
                    Dragon Warrior. Who am I kidding?
          
          The Five don't argue.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    But who will stop Tai Lung?
          
                              CRANE
                    He'll destroy everything...and
                    everyone.
          
          Shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. He
          looks oddly calm as he turns around.
          
                              SHIFU
                    No, evacuate the Valley. You must
                    protect the villagers from Tai
                    Lung's rage.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    What about you master?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I will fight him.
          
                                                                  71.
          
          
                              PO
                    What?
          
                              SHIFU
                    I can hold him off long enough for
                    everyone to escape.
          
                              PO
                    But Shifu, he'll kill you.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Then I will finally have paid for
                    my mistake.
          
          The Five and Po look devastated.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Listen to me, all of you. It is
                    time for you to continue your
                    journey without me. I am very proud
                    to have been your master.
          
          Shifu salutes them and turns away. Po is heartbroken. Crane
          steps forward and kindly puts a wing around Po, pulling away.
          
          Po resists for a moment, then lets the Five lead him off.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY
          
          The Five arrive at the base of the stairs.
          
                              TIGRESS
                    We've got to get them out safely.
          
          Monkey picks up a small child.
          
                              MONKEY
                    Come, little one. Let's find your
                    mama.

          They split up and begin helping the villagers evacuate. Po is
          left by himself.
          
          He makes his way through the bustling town.
          
                                                                     72.

          Po approaches the Noodle Shop.
          
                                PO
                    Hey, Dad.

                    Po!
          
          Seeing Po, Po's Dad hurries over and wraps his arms around
          his son. Po bends down to reciprocate the hug, as Po's dad
          pulls away, having fastened an apron around Po's waist.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)

                    Good to be back.
          
          Po's Dad goes back to packing things up.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Let's go Po. So, for our next shop,
                    it's time to face it -- the future
                    of noodles is dice-cut vegetables,
                    no longer slices.
          
          Dad starts to walk off, unaware that Po isn't following.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Also, I was thinking, maybe this
                    time we'll have a kitchen you can
                    actually stand up in. Hmm? You like
                    that?
          
          He turns and notices that Po hasn't moved. He walks to Po
          sympathetically.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, I'm sorry things didn't work
                    out. It just... wasn't meant to be.
          
          Po slumps against the cart.
          
                              PO'S DAD (CONT'D)
                    Po, forget everything else. Your
                    destiny still awaits. We are noodle
                    folk -- broth runs deep through our
                    veins.
          
                                                                  73.

          Dad is taken aback.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Po, I think it's time I told you

                              PO'S DAD
                    You heard me. Nothing. There is no
                    secret ingredient!
          
                              PO
                    Wait wait...it's just plain old
                    noodle soup? You don't add some
                    kind of special sauce or something?
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    Don't have to. To make something
                    special, you just have to believe
                    it's special.
          
          Po looks at his father with dawning realization. He picks up
          the Scroll.
          
          For a moment, Po stares at his reflection on the scroll, then
          he smiles serenely. He gets it now.
          
                                                                  74.

                    There is no secret ingredient...
          
          Po turns back to look at the palace.
          
                                                            CUT TO:
          
          
          EXT. JADE PALACE - DAWN
          
          At the top of the stairs, Shifu looks upon the Valley,
          awaiting his fate. With a gust of wind, Tai Lung appears
          before him.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I have come home, Master.
          
                              SHIFU
                    This is no longer your home. And I
                    am no longer your master.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Yes. You have a new favorite. So
                    where is this...Po? Did I scare him
                    off?
          
                              SHIFU
                    This battle is between you and me.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    So. That is how it's going to be?
          
                              SHIFU
                    That is how it must be.
          
          They fight. At last. Tai Lung punches Shifu clean through the
          doors of the Jade Palace.
          
          Tai Lung enters.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    I rotted in jail for twenty years
                    because of your weakness!
          
                              SHIFU
                    Obeying your master is not
                    weakness!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You knew I was the Dragon Warrior!
                    You always knew...
          
          Dissolve to FLASHBACK.
          
                                                                    75.
          
          
          A young Tai Lung looks expectant. Oogway shakes his head.
          
                              TAI LUNG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    But when Oogway said otherwise,
                    what did you do? What did you do?!
          
          Tai Lung looks to Shifu who averts his eyes and the past
          dissolves into the present.
          
                                 TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    NOTHING!
          
          Shifu takes a Kung Fu stance.
          
                              SHIFU
                    You were not meant to be the Dragon
                    Warrior! That was not my fault!
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    NOT YOUR FAULT?!
          
          Enraged, Tai Lung knocks over the Kung Fu artifacts and
          throws them at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHO FILLED MY HEAD WITH DREAMS?!
                    WHO DROVE ME TO TRAIN UNTIL MY
                    BONES CRACKED?! WHO DENIED ME MY
                    DESTINY?!
          
          Shifu dodges each attack.
          
                              SHIFU
                    It was never my decision to make!
          
          Tai Lung pulls Oogway's staff from the shrine.
          
                                 TAI LUNG
                    It is now.
          
          They fight. Tai Lung pins Shifu down with the staff.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    Give me the scroll!
          
                              SHIFU
                    I would rather die.
          
          They struggle for a beat until finally, the staff splinters
          into a hundred pieces. Shifu looks back at the pieces and a
          flutter of peach tree petals fly by. Caught off guard, Shifu
          gets kicked by Tai Lung into a column.
          
                                                                   76.
          
          
          Shifu climbs the column to the rafters. Tai Lung follows and
          sends them both crashing through the roof.
          
          Lightning flash.
          
          Grappling in mid-air, Tai Lung gets his hands around Shifu's
          throat as they crash back through the roof.
          
          They kick apart. Shifu crashes to the floor and lands hard.
          Tai Lung bounces off the wall and throws a lantern to the
          floor. Flames go everywhere. Tai Lung's arms are aflame as he
          charges at Shifu.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    All I ever did, I did to make you
                    proud! Tell me how proud you are,
                    Shifu! Tell me! TELL ME!
          
          THOOM! A fiery punch sends Shifu skidding across the floor
          and crashing against the reflecting pool. The flames
          extinguish and Tai Lung extends his claws.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    I have always been proud of you.
                    From the first moment, I've been
                    proud of you. And it was my pride
                    that blinded me. I loved you too
                    much to see what you were becoming.
                    What I was turning you into. I'm...
                    sorry.
          
          Tai Lung stops in his tracks. Shifu waits. Tai Lung's
          expression goes cold. He grabs Shifu by the throat.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    I don't want your apology. I want
                    my scroll!
          
          He holds Shifu up to the ceiling. Looking up, Tai Lung
          bristles when he sees the scroll is missing.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    WHAT? WHERE IS IT?!
          
          Tai Lung slams Shifu to the floor.
          
                              SHIFU
                        (weakly)
                    Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
                    halfway across China by now. You
                    will never see that scroll, Tai
                    Lung. Never. Never...
          
                                                                  77.
          
          
          Tai Lung is furious. He roars, ready to strike Shifu.
          Suddenly...
          
                               PO (O.S.)
                    Hey!
          
          Tai Lung turns around to find Po standing in the doorway.
          
                              PO (CONT'D)
                        (out of breath)
                    Stairs...
          
          Tai Lung casts Shifu aside.
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    Who are you?
          
                              PO
                    Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.
                        (exhales hard)
                    Huhhh...
          
                              TAI LUNG
                    You?! Him?!
                        (to Shifu)
                    He's a panda.
                        (back to Po)
                    You're a panda. What are you gonna
                    do, big guy? Sit on me?
          
                              PO
                    Don't tempt me. Haha. No. I'm gonna
                    use this. You want it? Come and get
                    it.
          
          Po shows him the Dragon Scroll.
          
          From out of nowhere, Tai Lung appears and punches Po across
          the room, grabbing the scroll knocked from Po's hands.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    Finally!
          
          Po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into Tai Lung,
          sending him flying into a column. Po puts on a brave face and
          strikes a pose as Tai Lung recovers and charges. Po turns to
          run.
          
          Tai Lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the Palace
          steps.
          
          Po clings to the scroll as Tai Lung delivers a kick and sends
          him crashing onto the theater rooftops below.
          
                                                                    78.
          
          
          Po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and
          smash Tai Lung. He briefly skids across the rooftop and comes
          right back at Po.
          
                              TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                    That scroll is mine!
          
          Down the Theater steps, Po and Tai Lung grapple for the
          scroll. Po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down
          stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down
          on Tai Lung's head. As they crash through the Gateway the
          scroll is knocked loose. Tai Lung goes for the scroll but Po
          snatches it away using a noodle lasso. The scroll flies
          towards him and bounces off his head. Tai Lung leaps for it,
          but Po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart
          which see-saws Po into the air. In mid-air, Po slurps the
          noodle.
          
          Up and over the rooftops, Po lands in a grove of bamboo trees
          and into a nearby wok shop. The scroll rolls to a stop in the
          street.
          
          As Tai Lung makes his move on the scroll, Po turns the array
          of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around
          to hide the scroll.
          
                                 PO
                    Lightning!
          
          Tai Lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as Po
          uses his bamboo stilts to block Tai Lung. The leopard swipes
          out the stilts and brings Po down on top of him as the scroll
          rolls down the steps towards the river.
          
          Po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. As Tai Lung chases
          down the scroll, he turns back to see Po flying through the
          fireworks-filled sky.
          
          Po slams through Tai Lung and crashes into a rock wall. The
          scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an
          ornamental rooftop dragon. He looks back at Tai Lung, who
          sees where the scroll has landed. Via the magic of cookie-
          vision, Po effortlessly scales the building. Tai Lung is
          shocked.
          
                               TAI LUNG
                    The scroll has given him power.
                        (then)
                    NOOO0!!
          
          He takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. The resulting
          shockwave collapses the building.
          
                                                                    79.
          
          
          Amazingly, Po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach
          the scroll in mid-air as Tai Lung leaps up behind him and
          unleashes a punishing blow that sends Po smashing into the
          ground. As Tai Lung lands, he delivers a final devastating
          punch.
          
          As the dust settles, Tai Lung is looming over Po in the
          impact crater.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                          (out of breath)
                      Finally... oh yes... the power of
                      the Dragon Scroll... is mine!
          
          Tai Lung grabs for the scroll and opens it. His face falls.
          
                                TAI LUNG (CONT'D)
                      It's NOTHING!!
          
          Po stirs.
          
                                PO
                      It's okay. I didn't get it the
                      first time either.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (disbelief)
                      What?
          
          Po gets to his feet.
          
                                PO
                      There is no secret ingredient. It's
                      just you.
          
          Tai Lung snarls and lunges at Po.
          
                                   TAI LUNG
                      RRRAAAH!
          
                                   PO

          Tai Lung attacks Po's nerve points. But Po begins giggling.
          
                                PO (CONT'D)

          Tai Lung's nerve attack has no effect on Po. Frustrated, he
          delivers a double-fisted punch to Po's belly.
          
                                                                  80.
          
          
          The shockwave ripples through Po's entire body and Po's arms
          come back and strike Tai Lung, sending the leopard crashing
          back into a building. Po looks at his hands, amazed at what
          he just did.
          
          Tai Lung rises from the rubble and runs at Po again. But Po
          strikes back, using an unorthodox panda-style technique, even
          getting Tai Lung to chomp down on his own tail. Po gives Tai
          Lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. Tai
          Lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at Po. But Po
          prepares... and Tai Lung is swiftly met by Po's IRON BELLY!
          He is launched into the air. Po waits... and waits... until
          finally, Tai Lung appears in the sky and crashes to the
          ground.
          
          Tai Lung is battered, but still defiant.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                          (heavy breathing)
                      You... can't defeat me. You're just
                      a big, fat panda!
          
          SCHWING! Po grabs Tai Lung's finger. Tai Lung's eyes go wide.
          
                                PO
                      I'm not a big, fat panda. I'm the
                      big, fat panda.
          
          Po's pinky pops up. Tai Lung gasps.
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      The Wuxi Finger Hold!
          
                                PO
                      Oh, you know this hold?
          
                                TAI LUNG
                      You're bluffing. You're bluffing!
                      Shifu didn't teach you that.
          
                                PO
                      Nope. I figured it out.
          
          He flexes his pinky...
          
                                  PO (CONT'D)
                      Skadoosh!
          
          KA-THOOM!
          
                                                                  81.
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY OF PEACE
          
          A mushroom cloud appears over the Valley, sweeping past the
          Furious Five and the fleeing villagers.
          
                                                       DISSOLVE TO:
          
          
          EXT. VALLEY SQUARE - A LITTLE LATER
          
          Villagers emerge from hiding. Po walks out from the mist
          looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.
          
                              KG SHAW
                    Look! The Dragon Warrior.
          
          As he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and
          his scarf is a torn apron.
          
          Villagers CHEER the Dragon Warrior. Po's Dad emerges from the
          crowd.
          
                              PO'S DAD
                    That's my boy. That big, lovely
                    kung fu warrior is my son!
          
                              PO
                    Thanks, Dad.
          
          Po hugs his dad. The wok falls off Po's head and rolls on the
          ground until Mantis appears in frame and stops it. The rest
          of the Five are with him. Po takes notice.
          
                                 PO (CONT'D)
                    Hey, guys.
          
                                 TIGRESS
                    Master.
          
          Tigress bows deeply. The others follow.
          
                                 FURIOUS FIVE
                    Master.

                        (modest)
                    Master?
                        (then, remembering)
                    Master Shifu!
          
          Po races toward the Jade Palace. He climbs the steps. Then
          more steps.
          
                                                                  82.
          
          
          INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Po arrives breathless at the Jade Palace. Shifu is still
          lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. Po rushes to his
          side.
          
                              PO
                    Master! Shifu! Shifu! Are you okay?
          
          Shifu weakly opens his eyes.
          
                              SHIFU
                    Po! You're alive!
                        (then, darkly)
                    Or we're both dead.
          
                              PO
                    No, Master, I didn't die. I
                    defeated Tai Lung!
          
                                SHIFU
                    You did?!
          
          Shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.
          
                              SHIFU (CONT'D)
                    Wow. It is as Oogway foretold --
                    You are the Dragon Warrior. You
                    have brought peace to this Valley.
                    And to me. Thank you. Thank you,
                    Po. Thank you...
          
          Shifu closes his eyes. He is still. Po starts freaking out.
          
                              PO
                    No! Master! No No No! Don't die,
                    Shifu. Please...
          
                              SHIFU
                        (eyes snapping open)
                    I'm not dying, you idiot-- ah,
                    Dragon Warrior. I'm simply at
                    peace. Finally.
          
                              PO
                    Oh. So, um, I should...stop
                    talking?
          
                              SHIFU
                    If you can.
          
          Po nods reverently as Shifu closes his eyes again. Master and
          pupil lie next to each other. The camera pulls up and back
          away from them. Po tries to remain still, but it's hard.
          
                                                                  83.
          
          
          He's about to say something, but he stops himself. He fidgets
          for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.
          
                              PO
                    Want to get something to eat?
          
                              SHIFU
                        (sighs)
                    Yeah.
          
                                                          IRIS OUT.

          INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING


          
          Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
          BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.

                                MS. BERRY
                    "Work." Today we're going to
                    share what our parents do for
                    work.
          QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
          their desks, addressing the class:

                              JEFF
                    My dad is a truck driver.

                              MELINDA
                    My mommy is a doctor.

                                CAROLYN
                    My dad is a librarian and my
                    mom is a vegetarian.

                              THEODORE
                          (with difficulty)
                    My father is a struck-sher-al-
                    engine-ear.

                                CRAIG     -
                    My mother is an actress. She
                    works at Denny's.

                                KELLY
                    My daddy works at a place
                    where they make stuff, and my
                    mommy is a mommy.

                                ELLIOT
                          (looking a little

                           CRAZED)
                    My father is a postal worker.
          The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:

                              MAX
                    My mom's a teacher.
          As Max starts to sit:

                              MS. BERRY
                    And your dad?

                                MAX

                          (HESITANT)
                    My dad? He's . . . a liar.

          

                                  MS. BERRY
                             (taken aback)

                        A liar? I don't think you
                        mean "a liar."

                                  MAX
                        Well... he wears a suit and
                        goes to court and talks to the
                        judge and--

                                  MS. BERRY

                             (RELIEVED)
                        Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
                        lawyer.

              Max shrugs.

              INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY


          
              FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.

                                  FLETCHER
                        A dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. The prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.

                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Well, for once I agree with
                        t he prosecutor. This is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.

                                  FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                        Put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM

              OUT:

          

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    You're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    You quiver in fear. The
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. The jurors RECOIL.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    And in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. Only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an ATM
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)

                           (CONCERNED)
                    As you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. You
                    want to help. First, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. Second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,

                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. You breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "Someone to look -after
                    the injured man! Oh joy!"
                    But do the police applaud your
                    initiative? Do they hail your
                    heroism? No-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!

          Fletcher is driving, Max beside him.

                              MAX
                    Dad, are we really going to go
                    to wrestling?

                              FLETCHER
                    Absolutely, Maxattacker. We
                    just have to stop by the
                    office for one minute.
          Max SIGHS. He's heard this before.

          Establishing the headquarters of ALLAN, STEWART &

          KONIGSBERG.
          As they head inside, Fletcher and Max pass a BEGGAR.

                              BEGGAR
                    'Scuse me, sir. Do you have
                    any change?

          Fletcher grabs The Daily Journal, paying for it with a
          HANDFUL OF CHANGE. His son takes this in.
          On their way to the elevators Fletcher and Max pass PHILIP,
          a dweebish bore.

                                PHILIP
                    Fletcher!

                                FLETCHER
                    Philip!

                              PHILIP
                    And this must be Max!

                             FLETCHER
                        (trying to brush
                         him off)
                 . Yes. Yes it is. Well, it was
                   good seeing you--
          Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.

                                PHILIP
                    You know, Ethel and I had a
                    blast at our last little get-
                    together.

                                FLETCHER
                    Oh, me too. I can never get
                    enough of charades. We'll
                    have to do it again sometime.
          Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the
          door's closing impededby Philip's foot.

                                PHILIP
                    When?

                                FLETCHER
                    Soon.
          The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.

                             PHILIP
                   How 'bout tonight?

          

                               FLETCHER
                    Not that soon. I'm taking Max
                    to see wrestling--

                              PHILIP
                    We love wrestling.     We could--

                              FLETCHER
                    I don't think so. See, Max is
                    really shy around strangers.
          Max looks up at Fletcher.    He isn't.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Tell you what -- give me your
                    card as a reminder. I'll call
                    y o u . Soon. Promise.

                              PHILIP
                    Great!
          Philip hands him his card just as the door closes.

          The receptionist, JANE, greets them. Jane has an ODD,
          UNATTRACTIVE HAIRDO. A large GIFT BASKET is on her desk.

                              JANE
                    Hi, Mr. Reid.

                          BASKET)
                    What's this?

                              JANE
                    I don't know who sent it. But
                    it's for Mr. Allan. It's his
                    anniversary.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ah... The Partnership
                    Committee meeting still
                    scheduled for Friday?

                          (as she goes)
                    Yep...
          Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket,
          scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there

                              MAX
                    What are you doing?

                              FLETCHER
                    Oh, I'm... fixing the card,
                          (shows him the
                           old card)
                    Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's

          ...Where a troubled FRED RAND is talking to MIRANDA, a
          beautiful, steely partner.

                              FRED
                    I can't do it.

                              M IRANDA
                    Fred, it's your duty to
                    present the strongest case
                    possible.

                              FRED
                    The strongest case possible,
                    consistent with the truth.

                              MIRANDA
                   Let the Judge decide what's
                   true. That's what he gets
                   paid for. You get paid to
                   win.

                              FRED
                   If you insist on my taking it
                   to trial, I'll represent Mrs.
                   Cole aggressively and
                   ethically. But, Miranda -- I
                   won't lie.
          Miranda looks out her window, calculating.

                              MIRANDA
                   Then we'll just have to find
                   someone who'will.

          

          INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES -- AFTERNOON


          
          Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out
          GREETINGS to his colleagues.

                              FLETCHER
                    Hey, Pete! Great tie!        ·.
          Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him.

                              FLETCHER
                    Thomas--looks like you're
                    losin' weight.
          THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's
          corpulent.

                              THOMAS
                    Gained three pounds.

          Fletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the
          fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary GRETA.

                    something wonderful.
          Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max
          turns to him.     .

                              MAX
                    Yeah?

                              FLETCHER
                    Oh, yeah. You're going to
                    love it. Uh, why don't you
                    play in my office for a
                    minute? Fax something, sue
                    someone, have a good time.
                    We'll be leaving in a second.

          
          Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind
          him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Damn!   I completely forgot.

                              GRETA
                    Oh, there's a surprise.
          Greta produces a wrapped GIFT.

                               FLETCHER
                    You're a saint. I should get
                    you something.

                               GRETA
                    You did.
          She holds up another, smaller package.

                               FLETCHER
                    Ah. Well, I always do the
                    classy thing. Any calls?

                                                                       ·

          A sad Max sits on Fletcher's big sofa. His heart sinks
          further when Fletcher enters. . . carrying two boxes of
          documents.

                              MAX
                    We're not going, are we?

                              FLETCHER
                    Of course we are. A promise
                    i s a promise. We are gonna
                    see wrestling or my name isn't
                    Fletcher T. Reid.

          

                                FLETCHER
                          (to wrestler)
                    Could you hand me that?
                          (the wrestler

                           DOES)
                    Thank you.
                            (without looking

                           UP)
                    We are having some fun, eh
                    Maxer?
          PUSH IN on Max; he isn't.

          ·INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Jerry paces. Audrey is on the phone, waiting.   She notices
          Jerry pacing.

                              AUDREY
                    Are you alright?

                                  JERRY
                    Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long
                    are you gonna be on the phone?

                                  AUDREY
                    I just wanted to say good-
                    night to Max, but he must
                    still be out with Fletcher,
                         (hangs up)

                              JERRY

                         (SUDDENLY)
                    Will you marry me?
          She's SHOCKED.

                              I

          

                                  AUDREY
                    Uh...would I . . . ? What did you
                    say?

                                JERRY

                           (NERVOUS)
                    I proposed, I . . . Look, I know
                    this Boston thing is a great
                    opportunity, good job,
                    mo ney .. . everything. But I
                    started to think about being
                    three thousand miles away from
                    you and Max. And I didn't
                    like it. I-- Look, I know
                    it's a lot to ask, to move and
                    everything, but I . . . . I love

          
                    you. I love your son.   Will
                    you marry me?
          She stares at him, excited, but nervous.

          EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          Early morning outside Fletcher's building.

          INT. FLETCHER'S STUDY - MORNING

          Fletcher types on his computer.   He's been up all night.
          He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees
          Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES.

                              FLETCHER
                    Max Factor... Happy birthday.
                    How old are you today?
                    T h ir t y ? Forty?

                              MAX
                    Five.

                              FLETCHER
                   Well, you've held up well. I
                   only wish there was some way
                   to commemorate such an
                   occasion, some small symbol to
                   mark this day, like....
          Fletcher produces --

                               FLETCHER
                    . . . A present! .

          
          Max eyes it with wonder.

                             MAX
                   What is it?

                              FLETCHER
                         (no idea)
                   It's... it's.
                         (it hits him)
                   a surprise.
          Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the
          box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and

          FULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM.

                             MAX
                   Baseball stuff!

                                 FLETCHER
                       Tonight. After your party,
                       you have my word on it.
          Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.

          EXT. JERRY'S CAR - MORNING

          Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of
          airline tickets.

                                 AUDR EY
                            (re: tickets)
                       Jerry, these are for tomorrow.

                                 JERRY
                       The company wants me to get
                       started right away.

                                 AUDREY
                   I can't just pick up and move
                   to Boston with two days
                   notice.

                              JERRY
                   Ju st come check it out. You
                   a nd Max, see the town. Let's
                 . pick out a place together.
                   Then, if you want to turn me
                   down and scar me for life,
                   fine.

                                 AUDREY
                   It's just not that simple...
                   What about my job? I've been
                   at UCLA three years.

                                 JERRY
                   It's New England. They're
                   lousy with colleges. You
                   can't swing a bat back there
                   without hitting a college.

          
                    You'd get a job there in a
                    second.

                              AUDREY
                    There are other factors
                    involved.

                          (POINTS)
                    T here they are now.       ·.
          They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher
          and Max are waiting. Fletcher's still reviewing a file.
          As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over.

                              AUDREY
                    Did you have fun? How were
                    the wrestling matches?

                              FLETCHER
                    Big fun. Manly fun. Am I
                    right, Maxie?

                              MAX

                          (HALF-HEARTEDLY)
                    It was fun..

                                                                    ·

                    So how were the wrestling
                    matches ? Did you have fun?

                              JERRY
                    Max , my man! My happy
                    birthday man!
          Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.   Jerry gives Max
          a light punch on the arm.

                              JERRY
                    One-two-three-four-five... and
                    one for good luck.

                              FLETCHER
                    Did you see that? He struck
                    the child!

                              MAX
                    Look what dad got me!
                         (shows the glove)

                              JERRY
                   Whoa! Great! I have my glove
                   in the car. We'll stop in the
                   park on the way home and play
                   c atch. Then tonight we'll oil

          
                    it, wrap a rubber band around
                    it. . . It'll be great.
                          (to Fletcher)
                    Great birthday present, dad!
          Fletcher hates him.    Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.

          alluring woman in her early thirties/ review the document
          he spent the previous·night putting together.

                    This is good. This is really

                   I mean... isn't that a
                   problem?

                                FLETCHER
                   Mrs. Cole, the only problem
                   here is that after you've
                   provided years of faithful
                   service and loving support, of
                   raising his children -- They
                   are his?

                   one single act of

          I know you. You are the
          victim here. The wife of a

          --Seven .other men. You're not
          trying to deny him what is
          r ig htf ull y his. All you're
          insisting on is what is
          r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe
          an idgy-smidgy bit more. I
          think you're bending over
          backwards.

          father.

                     FLETCHER
          And you've always been a good
          wife.

                       VIRGINIA
                  (getting worked

                   UP)
          Yeah. . .

                     FLETCHER
          There's such a thing as being
          t oo nice. That's why you need
          aggr essive representation. To
          show the court that there is
          more than one side to this
          st ory. All I'm asking is the
          opportunity to see that
          justice is done on your
          behalf.
                (takes her hand)
          Will you give me that
          opportunity?

          
          He stares into her eyes. A moment, then...

                                 VIRGINIA
                    Yes! I ' m tired of getting
                    kicked around.

                              FLETCHER
                    Good for you!

                                 VIRGINIA
                    Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so
                    grateful I have an attorney I
                    can trust.
          S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a
          farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.
          Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
          She moves in on him.

                                 MIRANDA
                    You're good. You're really
                    good.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Oh, pshaw.
                         (pronounces it
                          with the "p")
          She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket.

                                 MIRANDA
                   N o, I mean it. The Cole case
                   is worth a truckload of money
                   to this firm, not to mention
                   the press it's going to
                   g en er at e . You win this case
                   and I guarantee you'll make
                   partner.

                           (STRAIGHTENING
                            his tie)
                   Actually, how would you like
                   to make a partner right now?

                                 FLETCHER
                    Excuse me?
          She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS.

          INT, AUDREY AND MAX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

          
          A PARTY in progress, KINDERGARTNERS being entertained by a
          MAN in a clown suit and clown make-up.

          

                               CLOWN

                          (SINGING)
                    Captain Fuzzy is my name,
                    Making children happy is my
                    game,
                    With a shake and a juggle,
                    And a big belt buckle,
                    You'll all be glad I came. '
          He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to
          HONK. Audrey and Jerry watch.

                                AUDREY
                         (indicating the

                          CLOWN)
                    What do you think?

                                JERRY
                    Well, if you don't hire your
                    brother, who will?

          

                                           .
          She heads into...

          INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS


                                                                   ·

                                JERRY
                    They called me again from
                    B oston. They really want me
                    there tomorrow.

                              AUDREY
                    . . . I can't go to Boston.

                                JERRY
                    How come?

                                AUDREY
                   Max.

                             JERRY
                   He'll love it there.

                              AUDREY
                    It's Fletcher.

                                JERRY
                   Fletcher?

                             AUDREY
                   I can't move Max three
                   thousand miles away from his
                   father.

          

                                JERRY
                     Audrey, I have never said a
                     bad word about your ex --

                                AUDREY
                     I know.

          

                                JERRY
                    But how much responsibility
                    does Fletcher take for Max,
                    now? He'd never come over if
                    you didn't remind him.

                               AUDREY
                    I know. But if they're three
                    thousand miles apart they'll
                    never see each other.
                    Fletcher will never come to
                    Boston and how can I send Max
                    cross-country to him?

                               .JERRY
                    So because your ex-husband is
                    unreliable, we can't-'-

                               AUDREY
                    I know, it's not logical, it's
                    emotional. I'm sorry.
          Pause.

                              JERRY
                    I still want to marry you.

                              AUDREY
                    Are you sure?
          Jerry picks up the PHONE, pulls out a piece of paper,
          dials.

                               JERRY
                          (into phone)
                   Mr. Crisitelli, Jerry
                   She!ton... I hope I'm not
                   calling too late... Mr.
                   Crisitelli, I'm afraid I have
                   to turn down your offer..'. So
                   am I . . . Well, I've fallen in
                   love with this beautiful woman
                   in L.A. and she doesn't want
                   to leave and I won't leave
                   without her... Well, thank you
                   very much... Yes, good-bye.

          
                            (hangs up)
                      He wasn't there, but that's
                  1   the speech I would've made.
          She smiles and KISSES him.             The PHONE RINGS.   Audrey
          answers.

                                   AUDREY
                      Hello...

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          

                                   A UDREY
                      Fletcher, where are you?
                      We're getting ready to cut the
                      cake.

                                   FLETCHER
                      Urn, actually, something has
                      come up. A problem on a new
                      caaa--                .
          Miranda bites one of Fletcher's nipples.

                                   F LET CHE R
                      A-h-h-h-!

          

                                AUDREY
                      What happened?

                                   FLETCHER
                      Nothing. I just nailed my
                      ·knee into the desk... Listen,
                      I'm really sorry I can't 'make
                      it.

                                AUDREY
                      Max is going to be so
                      disappointed.

                                   FLETCHER
                      I'll make it up to him, I
                      promise. I'll pick him up
                      from school tomorrow, okay?

                                 AUDREY
                      Do you want me to put him on
                      the phone?
          Miranda starts "reeling in" the phone cord.

                                   FLETCHER
                      Ah, no.     I have to go.

          

                                 AUDREY
                    Right.
          ANGRILY, she hangs up. Fletcher stares UNHAPPILY at the
          phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.

          INT. AUDREY AND MAX'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

          WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to
          a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.
          Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.

                              AUDREY
                    All right, birthday boy, make
                    a wish.
          Max doesn't respond.

                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
                    C'mon, honey. It can be
                    anything-- whatever you want
                    most in the world.
          When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..

                              AUDREY (CONT'D)
                    Max, your dad is sorry. He
                    had to work.

                               MAX
                    He said he was coming. He
                    promised.

                               AUDREY
                    Yes, well, he... promises
                    he'll see you tomorrow.
          Max doesn't believe it.     <
          He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In
          VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.

                               MAX (V.O.)
                    I wish, for just one day, Dad
                    couldn't tell a lie.
          He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A
          strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
          up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.

                                                    CUT TO:
          A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--

          

          INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
          adorned with Fletcher's shoes...
          To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
          To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...
          To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to
          Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--

                                MIRANDA
                    S o . . . was it good for you?
          Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
          way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.

                              FLETCHER
                    I've had better.
          Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
          compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.

          INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully
          kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF
          CLOTHES follow.
          The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
          A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her
          broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .

          INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING


          
          An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With
          regret and wonder he remembers:

                              FLETCHER
                    "I've had better?"

          INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING


          
          Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in
          the mirror, mouth foaming.

                              FLETCHER
                    "I've had better?!"

          INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.

          

                               FLETCHER
                         (laughing it off)
                    "I've had better?"
          I t arrives. He steps in.

          INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING

          The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a
          beautiful young WOMAN.

                              FLETCHER
                    New in the building?

                              MODEL
                    I just moved in Monday.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ah. Well, you must allow me
                    to give you the grand tour.

                               MODEL

                          (SHE'S

                           INTERESTED)
                    O h? Do you do that for all
                    the new tenants?

                              FLETCHER
                    No. Just the ones I want to
                    bang like a drum.
          Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...

          INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

          We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door
          opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps
          out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.

          EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING

          A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
          is accosted by a BEGGAR.

                              BEGGAR
                    Any change, Mister?

                              .FLETCHER
                    Absolutely.
          But he continues walking.

                              BEGGAR
                    Could you spare some?

          

                               FLETCHER
                    Unquestionably.
          Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
          truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.

                                BEGGAR
                    Will you?

                                FLETCHER
                    No.

                                BEGGAR
                    How come?

                                FLETCHER
                   Because I resent your
                   p re sen ce. You fill me with an
                   unpleasant mixture of disgust
                   and guilt. Further, I don't
                   believe you'll use the money
                   for food, but I believe you'll
                   use it for, at worst, drugs,
                   or, at best, whiskey, or
                 . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.
          As Fletcher heads up the stairs...

                                BEGGAR
                   Jerkoff.

          INT. COURTROOM - MORNING


          
          A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,

                             VIRGINIA
                   You look like you're having a
                   rough morning.

                              FLETCHER
                    I've had better.
          He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely
          wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters
          with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.

                              DANA
                   Good morning, Fletcher.

                                FLETCHER
                   Dana.         "

          

                                RICHARD
                    All right, Virginia, how much
                    will it take to put an end to
                    this?

                              FLETCHER
                    Fifty per cent of your estate.
          Richard is SHOCKED.

                                DANA
                    Fifty per cent? With a pre-
                    nup and proof of adultery?
                    What's your case?

                               FLETCHER
                    Our case is simply this. . .
          Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
          GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
          succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.

                                DANA        .
                    Interesting, though based on
                    your track record, I expected
                    a little more.
          Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
          the brief.

                                FLETCHER   ..
                   Wa it! Wait!    I've got it in
                   writing!
          But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
          Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.

                                DANA
                    Let go!

                              FLETCHER
                    I'm trying!

          
          He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
          HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.
          At this moment the BAILIFF calls.

                                BAILIFF
                   All rise for the Honorable
                   Judge William Stevens.

          

                              DANA
                    Very funny, Fletcher. You
                    want to play hardball, I'm
                    game.
          JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.

          

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Calling case BA 09395, Richard
                    Cole versus Virginia Cole.
                    How're we doing this morning,
                    counsel?

                              DANA
                    Fine, thank you.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   And you, Mr. Reid?

                              FLETCHER
                    Well, I'm a little upset about
                    a bad sexual episode I had
                    last night--
          Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
          he just said. After an awkward silence--

                              JUDGE STEVENS

                         (DRYLY)
                   Well, you're still young.
                   It'll happen more and more.
                   In the meantime, what do you
                   say we get. down to business?
                   First, Mr. Reid, I see that
                   your client was previously
                   represented by Mr. Rand of
                   your office.

                             FLETCHER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    I take it you're seeking to
                    substitute in as counsel?

                             FLETCHER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   Fine , fine. And for the
                   record, the reason is?

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Mr. Rand had severe ethical
                    objections to my client's
                    case.
          Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
          world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    I take it you don't share the
                    same ethical objections, Mr.
                    Reid?

                                 FLETCHER
                    I have lower standards, Your
                    Honor.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
                    wants the substitution of
                    counsel, I'll allow it. Is
                    that what you want, Mrs. Cole?
          Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose
          unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.

                                 VIRGINIA

                            (UNSURE)
                    Yes?

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    Fine.

                             VIRGINIA
                        (aside, to

                         FLETCHER)
                   What are you doing?

                                 FLETCHER

                            (WORRIED)

                                                                       .
                   I don't know.
                         (to judge, with

                          SOME

                          DESPERATION)
                   Your Honor, I ' d like a
                   continuance!

                             JUDGE STEVENS "
                   This case has already been
                   delayed several times, Mr.
                   Reid.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    I realize that, Your Honor,
                    but I ' d really, really, really
                    like a continuance.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    I'll have to hear good cause,
                    counselor. What's the
                    problem?

          FLETCHER'S P.O.V.

          
          The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
          faster -- until we wind up squarely on --

          FLETCHER'S FACE

                              FLETCHER
                    I can't lie!

                                 JUDGE STEVENS

                            (IMPATIENT)
                   Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
                   still waiting for the good
                   caus e. Now, do you have it or
                 . not?

                    '            FLETCHER

                            (TRUTHFUL)
                    Not.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Motion for a continuance
                    denied. Is there any chance
                    of a settlement in this case?

                                DANA
                    I don't think so, Your Honor.
                    Mr. Reid made it abundantly
                    clear that the last thing in
                    the world he wanted was to --

                               FLETCHER

                          (DESPERATE)

                    SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE!
          Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                    There appears to have been a
                    change in strategy. Let's go
                    to my chambers and negotiate.
          He BANGS the gavel.

          

          INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING

          Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge

                             DANA
                   Your Honor, under the terms of
                   the prenuptual agreement, if
                   Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
                   she is entitled to nothing.
                   We have in our possession an
                   audiotape made by a licensed
                   private investigator of an
                   explicit act of sexual
                   congress with a man who is not
                   her husband.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
                   Reid.

                             FLETCHER
                   It certainly does.

                             DANA
                   However, my client has no
                   desire to see his ex-wife
                   destitute. Against my advice,
                   he's willing to offer her a
                   cash settlement of.two point
                   four million dollars.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   Two four seems like a pretty
                   fair offer, Mr. Reid.

                             FLETCHER
                   Fantastically fair.
                   Phenominally fair. In fact,
                   I'd say beyond fair, bordering
                   on stupid.
          Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
          refreshing.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   What are you suggesting, Mr.
                   Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
                   willingness to proffer such an
                   offer betrays a lack of faith
                   in her position?

                             FLETCHER
                        (utterly sincere)
                   No, not at all. She's got my
                   client dead to rights. When

          
                    attorneys go to sleep at
                    night, they dream of having a
                    case as strong as hers.

                              DANA
                    Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
                    right, I admit it -- I've seen
                    you make even the lamest case
                    fly. But this time I have
                    you. Even Clarence Darrow
                    couldn't explain this away.
          She brandishes the audiotape.

                              JUDGE SAMIOAN
                    Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a
                    dynamite explanation, I'd say
                    you're dead in the water.
                    How's you client's story?

                              FLETCHER
                    The best that money can buy,
                    Y o u r Honor.       ·

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Strong corroborating evidence?

                              FLETCHER
                    We have evidence that you are
                    not going to-believe.
          Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    You're pretty confident how
                    this trial is going to come
                    out, eh, Mr. Reid?

                              FLETCHER
                         (hopeless) .
                    "Confident" is too weak a
                    word, Your Honor. I am
                    certain what will happen if I
                    take this puppy to trial. The
                    verdict will be a stunning,
                    humiliating defeat that will
                    cut a spectacularly promising
                    legal career off at the knees.
          Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana

          She storms out, leaving an astounded Fletcher behind.

                      You are some negotiator, Mr.
                      Reid. If your client has half
                      a brain, she'll jump at the

                      No? ! Mrs. Cole, this offer
                      was a miracle. I'm talking

          But before Fletcher can finish, the judge enters.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a
                    settlement?
          Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
          He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.

                               JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)

          He BANGS the gavel. Fletcher emits an involuntary whimper.

          INT. HALLWWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          DA ZED, Fletcher makes his way down the hall. Jane comes
          toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He
          tries to avoid her, but...

          The now panicked Fletcher breaks into a run, passing Fred.

          He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath.

                    Aha!
          He holds up a BLUE PEN.

          S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His
          feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He
          finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote

          INADVERTENTLY:

          FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in

          Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment --
          then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen.

                               FLETCHER
                   I don't think I can. I had a
                   case I was certain would
                   settle and it didn't. I have
                   to go to trial this afternoon,

          Fletcher considers what he just said, realizes it is true.

                   How about that. I really do.

                             FLETCHER
                   Having sex.

                             AUDREY
                         (barely holding
                          her temper),
                   It must have been with someone
                   very "special."

                             FLETCHER
                   No. It was with someone I
                   don't even like. But I
                   thought it would help my
                   career and at the moment that

          
                   seemed more important than
                   attending my son's birthday!

            son.             ,                 .

                                     AUDREY
                       No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't
                       make it. I will. I'll work
                       it out.
            Max is disappointed.

                                   MAX

               INTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR

          

                    AUDREY
          Hello.

                    FLETCHER
          Audrey, let me explain.
          Something has happened to me--

                    AUDREY
          Fletcher, something else is
          about to happen to you.

                    FLETCHER.
          What do you mean?

                    AUDREY
          Max and I are moving to
          Boston.

                    FLETCHER
          What?!

                    AUDREY
          Jerry asked me to marry him.
          He wants Max and I to fly with
          him this weekend to pick out a
          house. And I'm going to go.
          God knows I don't have any
          reason to stay here.

                    FLETCHER
               (panicking)    .
          Wait, you can't move! If you
          take Max away... I'll
          practically never see him.

                    AUDREY
          Well then you'll have pretty
          much the same relationship you
          have with him now.

                    FLETCHER
          Audrey, please.... Is this
          because of what I just said on
          the phone?

                    AUDREY
          That was the straw and this is
          the camel's back saying
          goodbye.

                    FLETCHER
          Where are you?

                    AUDREY
          Heading home.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    When you gee there, stay
                    there. I'll be right over.
                    We have to talk.

                               AUDREY

                    FLETCHER--

                               FLETCHER
                    I'll be right- there!

          
          He hangs up and heads for the door.      It opens and Miranda
          enters.

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Aaaah!

                               MIRANDA
                   Flet cher. Fletcher, Fletcher,
                   Fletcher. I must confess--
                   after last night's incident, I
                   was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was
                   tempted to do whatever little
                   things lie in my power to
                   scuttle your chances of making
                   partner.
          Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.

                              MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                   But then I thought, "No,
                   that 's not fair. Fletcher
                   didn't mean to insult me."

                         (STRAIGHTENING
                          his tie)
                   "It was just some massive,
                   boneheaded misunderstanding,
                   and Fletcher is very, very
                   sorry."
          Fletcher smiles.   It looks like he's off the hook, until--

                              MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                    Isn't that right, Fletcher?

                             FLETCHER
                        (in agony)
                   Uh -- not really, no.

                              MIRANDA
                          (stunned, angry)
                   N o ? No?! What are you
                   sayi ng? Have you no respect
                   for me?!

          

                               FLETCHER
                    None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d
                    like to respect you, and if it
                    weren't for your mistreatment
                    of the associates, your
                    rudeness to the staff, and the
                    fact that your work sucks, I
                    would.

                              M IRANDA
                    But -- what about last night?

                               FLETCHER
                    I was afraid you wouldn't
                    support my partnership if I
                    turned you down. Plus, I have
                    an immature need for sexual
                    conquests.

          INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES - MORNING

          W e HEAR A SMACK! The door flies opens -- and a furious
          Miranda stalks off.

          INT. BMW - MOVING / EXT, STREET - MORNING

          Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his
          pocket.

                               FLETCHER
                    Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.
          He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
          almost hits an OLD MAN.

                              FLETCHER
                    The color of the pen is --
                    re d !      .
          But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
          to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a
          truck. The DRIVER screams:

                              DRIVER
                    What's your problem, schmuck?!

                                FLETCHER
                           (the truth)
                    I ' m an inconsiderate prick!

          
            Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.

                                FLETCHER (CON "ID)
                      C'mon, you can do this! The
                      color of the pen is -- RED!
           This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
           POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.

                                  FLETC HER
                     S hi t !!

          
           Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.

                               POLICE OFFICER
                     Do you know why I stopped you?

                                  FLETCHER
                     Depends on how long you were
                     following me.

                                  POLICE OFFICER
                     Why don't we take it from the
                     top.

                                FLETCHER
                    ·     (in agony)
                     Here goes -- I didn't fasten
                     my seatbelt, I didn't glance
                     in my rearview mirror, I
                     didn't signal when I pulled
                     away from the curb, I sped, I
                     followed too closely, I ran a
                     stop sign, I almost hit :a
                    Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a
                    ge ezer, I sped some more, I
                    failed to yield at a
                    crosswalk, I changed lanes in
                    the intersection, I changed
                    lanes without signalling, and
                    I changed lanes in the

                    INTERSECTION-WITHOUT
                    signalling while running a red
                    light and speeding.
          A long moment.

                             POLICE OFFICER
                   May I see your driver's
                   license?

                                 FLETCHER
                   No.

          

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    And why is that?

                              FLETCHER
                    It's in my other pants.

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    I see. And where are your ·

                    Do you expect me to believe
                    that?

                              FLETCHER
                    No.

          

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    Do you think I'm an idiot?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes -- but that's beside the
                    point! My license actually is
                    in my other pants, and they
                    actually were hanging from a
                    credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to
                    you! I mean, I would if I
                    could, but I can't!

                              POLICE OFFICER
                    I see. So you ..have no reason
                    to try and hide your license
                    from me?

                              FLETCHER
                   I didn't say that. I have
                   other reasons. Seventeen
                   reasons, to be precise.
                         (begrudgingly,
                          off the
                          officer's look)

          A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is
          headed to her car.

                    Wait? You know, I just had an
                    insight into myself. I ' m
                    crazy. You call me up and .
                    tell me to wait here because
                    you'll be right over and --
                    here's the crazy part -- I
                    actually wait.

                              FLETCHER
                    I can explain--

                              AUDREY
                    I missed a department meeting.
                    I. . . Did you come in a cab?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes.

                              AUDREY
                    Where's your car?

          EXT, POLICE IMPOUND YARD - MORNING

          
          Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins
          Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.

                              FLETCHER
                    Thank you. . I can't tell you
                    how much this means to me.

                              AUDREY
                    I can. One thousand, six
                    hundred, and fifty-four
                    dollars and eleven cents.

                              FLETCHER
                    Ow.

          
          At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a
          TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and.
          parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    You scratched my car!

                    Where?     .

                              FLETCHER
                   Right there!

          

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    Oh that? That was already
                    there.

                            (OUTRAGED)
                    Why, you -- you liar! Do you
                    know what I ' m going to do
                    about this?

                                TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    What?

                              FLETCHER
                         (angrier and

                          ANGRIER)
                    ...Nothing! Because if I take
                   you to small-claims court, it
                   will just drain eight hours
                   out of my life, and you
                   probably won't show up, and if
                   I finally got the judgment
                   you'd just stiff me anyway, so
                   what I'm gonna do is piss and
                   moan like an impotent jerk and
                 . then bend over and take it up
                   the tail pipe!

                              TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE
                    You've been here before,
                    haven't you?
          He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.

                                AUDREY
                    Well I can't remember when
                    I've had more fun, now if
                    you'll excuse me, I have a
                    class.
          She starts out.

                                FLETCHER
                    Audrey, wait. I want to talk
                    to you about this Boston
                    situation.

                             . AUDREY
                    What do you want to say?

                                FLETCHER
                   You can't go. It's not fair.
                   Taking Max three thousand
                   miles away is not fair.

          

                              AUDREY
                    Let' s define "fair." Last
                  · night a five-year old boy was
                    crushed because his father
                    lied to him about coming to
                    his birthday party. Fair?

                              FLETCHER
                    Last night--

                             AUDREY
                   -- Was none of my business.
                   When it happened two years ago
                   it was my business, but now I
                   don't have to care anymore.
                   See, that's the magic of
                   div orce . But it does matter
                   to Max. Everything you do
                   matters to him... and
                   everything you don't do.

                              FLETCHER
                   All right-- now let me tell
                   you something...you're
                   absolutely right. I'm guilty
                   of all charges. I'm throwing
                   myself on the mercy of your
                   -court.
          Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very
          sincere, but she can't trust him.

                              FLETCHER {CONT'D)
                   I have an idea. I'll come
                   over tonight, right after
                   court lets out and play with
                   M ax. Have him invite some
                   fri ends over. We'll have a
                   game and everything. Then,
                   you and I can sit down and
                   talk.

                             AUDREY
                   We're suppose to be on a plane

                   TONIGHT--

                             FLETCHER
                   No, Audrey. Just talk to me
                   abou t this first. Please.
                   Au drey, I've lost you. Don't
                   make me lose Max, too.

                             AUDREY
                   You're really coming?

          

                              FLETCHER
                    This is iron-clad. This is
                    the mother of all promises.
                    What time?

                              AUDREY
                    ...Six?

                              FLETCHER
                    Ten-to-six.

                          (UNSURE)
                    All right... only if I tell
                    Max you're coming and you
                    don't show up and I have to
                    see that look on Max's face --
                    that heartbreaking look-- it's
                    Boston, Fletcher.

                              FLETCHER.
                    I will be there.

          
          As Audrey gets in her car -- .

                              AUDREY
                   I hope so. Do you know what
                   your son was doing at nine-
                   fif teen las t ni ght? He was
                   making a wish on his birthday
                   c ake. He was wishing that,
                   for just one day, his dad
                   couldn't tell a lie.
          She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
          when a new thought strikes him.

                              FLETCHER
                   Oh my God! That-'s it! An
                   innocent kid - - a heartfelt
                   plea-- a birthday wish! Sure,
                   it' s impossible --but it
                   'makes sense!..! If he can wish
                   it, he can unwish it!

          INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HALLWAY


          
          Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his
          arm.

          INT. MAX'S KINDERGARTEN CLASS

          Ms. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.   Max
          brightens.

          

                               MAX
                    Dad!

                    Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms.
                    Berry, Max's teacher!

                               FLETCHER
                    Hi. Listen, I need to talk to

                    MAX--

                               MS. BERRY
                    Mr. Reid, we were just talking
                    ab ou t careers. You're a
                    lawyer, aren't you?

                                FLETCHER

                           (WARY)
                    Yes.

                              MAX
                    Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful
                    for the children to hear
                    something positive about
                    lawyers!

                              FLETCHER
                    Well, actually-- ·

                    Children! .Mr. Reid is going
                    to tell us what it's like to
                    be a lawyer.
          She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center
          s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.

                               FLETCHER
                    Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and
                    I work at a big law firm with
                    a lot of other lawyers and I
                    do stuff in a law court.
                    Thank you.
          He starts out.

                               MS. BERRY
                    One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe
                    some of the children have

                    QUESTIONS
                         (hands shoot up)
                    Jeffrey?

                              FLETCHER
                    It means if you're daddy left
                    your mommy, he'd call me.

                              CRAIG
                    So what do you do?

                    No. I ' d like to, but I can't
                    right now.
          Max is disappointed again.

                               FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    I ' m sorry I missed your party
                    la st night. How was your

                              MAX
                    Stupid. His big nose and

                              FLETCHER
                    That's why he should have worn
                    make-up.
          Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
          Max doesn't laugh.

                      '       MAX .
                    I want to play kickball with
                    my friends.-

                    Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother
                    told me about... the wish you
                    made last night. It came
                    true.
          Max is amazed.

                              MAX
                    Really? You mean you have to
                    tell the truth?

                              FLETCHER
                    Yes.

                             FLETCHER
                   No matter what.

          
          Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.

                              MAX
                    Is wrestling real?

                    Not in a million years.

                               MAX
                    If I keep making this face--
                         (makes a horrible

                          FACE)
                    will it get stuck that way?

                   after lunch, will I drown?

                               FLETCHER
                    Only if you can't 'swim.

                    Because your mom buys it.

                             MAX
                   How come you're always too
                   busy to play with me?
          The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels
          awful.

                               FLETCHER
                   I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey,
                   you know I'm coming over
                   to nig ht. We're gonna play
                   together.

                               MAX
                   Baseball?

          

                                FLETCHER
                  . Yes! This is absolutely an
                    A-number one promise. You and
                    I -- tonight -- baseball.
          Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.

                                FLETCHER
                      Now, listen, Max, I need a
                      favor from you. I ' m in a
                      little trouble today. I need
                      you to take that wish back.

                                MAX
                      So you can lie?

                                FLETCHER
                      Not to you.

                                MAX
                      To who?

                                FLETCHER
                      Max, sometimes grownups...
                      need to lie. It's hard to
                      explain, but i f . . . Look,
                      here's an example. When Mommy
                      was pregnant with you, she
                      gained a little weight.
                      Se venty pounds. I thought she
                      was gonna give birth to a car.
                      But she'd say to me "How do I
                      lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh,
                      honey, you're beautiful,
                      you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I
                      would've hurt Mommy's
                      fee ling s. Understand?
          Max nods.

                                MAX
                      You didn't think she was
                      beautiful.

                                FLETCHER
                      Right. No... Max, I don't
                      know how to get along in the
                      grown-up world if I have to
                      stick to the truth. I could
                      lose my case, I could lose my
                      promotion, I could even lose,
                      my job... Do you understand?
          Max shakes his head "no."

          

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      Will you help me anyway?
          A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.

                                 FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      That's my boy!
          Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He
          takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on
          himself.

                                FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                      Now, do whatever you did last
                      night... only this time, make
                      an un-wish.
          Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He
          takes a breath-- and blows them out.

                                MAX
                      I did it. ^

          Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher
          hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she

          SLAPS HIM.
          Fletcher returns to his son.

                                MAX
                      Did it work?

                      Not like I ' d hoped. Did you
                      really unwish it?
          Max nods.

                                   MAX
                      Only...

                                   FLETCHER
                      Only what?

                                   MAX
                      Yesterday, when I wished it, I
                      r ea lly meant it. This time
                      when I unwished it I only did
                      it 'cause you told me to.

          

                                FLETCHER
                         (losing patience)
                    Well, then do it again.        Only
                    this time, mean it.

                                MAX
                    I can't.

                                FLETCHER
                    Why not?!

                                MAX
                    Because I don't want you to
                    lie.

                                FLETCHER
                    I explained this to you! I
                    have to lie. Everybody lies!
                    Mommy lies, even the wonderful
                    Jerry lies--

                                        '

                                MAX

                    makes me feel bad.

          Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.

                    I have to go.

                                FLETCHER
                    I am coming over, tonight,
                    Max. You believe me, don't
                    you?
          Max hesitates, then nods.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    I'll see you tonight, buddy...
                    That's a promise.
          Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks
          at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.

          EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DAY


          
          A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his
          office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.

          

                              MACHO ATTORNEY
                    Yo, Fletcher! How's it
                    hanging?

                               FLETCHER
                    Short and shrivelled.
          Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He
          shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him
          anyway.

                               PHILIP
                    Fletcher! I'm still waiting
                    for your call. I guess you
                    must've lost my card --

                               FLETCHER

                              PHILIP

                    don't you swing by my place
                    around seven-thirty!
          Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him
          resolutely.

                              FLETCHER
                    Philip... I don't want to come
                    over to your house!
          A long moment, then --

                               PHILIP
                   Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's
                   this new karaoke bar I've been
                   dying to try. I'll pick you
                   up at your office! Seven-
                   thirty! !
          And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.

          Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives
          him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.

                   No.
          He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows
          him in, leaving his door open.

          Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.

                             GRETA
                   Are you okay?

                             FLETCHER
                   My son hates me.

                                GRETA
                   No! He loves you. I've seen
                   y ou together. You're his
                   hero.

                                FLETCHER
                   O h yeah? Last night at his
                   birthday party, he made a
                   ·wish. That I wouldn't be able
                   to tell a lie for one whole
                   day.

                   What?

                                FLETCHER
                   It's true. Didn't it seem odd
                   to you that I kept telling the
                   truth all morning?

                             GRETA
                   Well, yeah, but...

                   you would give it to me out of
                   your own pocket and you said
                   the company wouldn't permit it
                   because it creates jealousy
                   among the other secretaries?
                   Was that true or did you just
                   not want to pony up the dough?

          The phone flies into the air. He catches it.

                              FLETCHER {CONT'D)
                    Mom... Well, I wasn't actually
                    on vacation... Because I
                    didn't want to talk to you...
                    Because you insist on talking

          He pushes -two more buttons. Then SCREAMS.

          Greta stops.     She seems to consider.

                                 GRETA
                    A few years ago a friend of
                    mine had a burglar up on her
                    roof.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Yes?

                   A burglar. -He fell through
                   the kitchen skylight and
                   landed on a cutting board on a
                   butcher's knife, cutting his
                   l e g. He sued my friend. The

          
                    burglar sued my friend.
                    Thanks to guys like you-- he
                    won. My friend had to pay him
                    six thousand dollars. Is that
                    justice?

                               FLETCHER

                    My point is, it's hard to get
                    justice. But this is justice,

          She leaves.   Fletcher starts to give chase...

                    GRETA--
          He runs directly into Miranda.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Aaaah!
          Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.

                                 MIRANDA
                    Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump
                    i nto you. Are you busy?

                                 FLETCHER
                    Extremely.

                                 MIRANDA
                    Good. Would you follow me,
                    please?
          Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.

                               MIRANDA (CONT'D)
                   Fletcher, did you know that
                   the partnership committee is
                   being headed up by Mr. Allan
                   himself?

                          NOD)
                   Say, you used to work directly
                   for Mr. Allan, didn't you?
                        (off his waried

                          NOD)
                   Tell me, what do you think of
                   him?

                    He's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.

                         (GRINNING)
                    How delightful!
          She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --

          INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

          The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN,
          the founder himself. Fletcher freezes.

                              MIRANDA
                    Pardon me for interrupting
                    your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you
                    remember Fletcher Reid.

                                                                       ·

                   ·It's good to see you again,
                   Fletcher. '.
          An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.

                              MIRANDA
                    Oh, that's right. You used to
                    work together. .Tell me, what
                    do you think of Mr. Allah?
          Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's
          trying to hold it back, but--

                              MIRANDA
                    I said... What do you think of
                    Mr. Allan?

                              FLETCHER     .
                    He's a pedantic,
                    pontificating, pretentious
                    bastard, a belligerent old
                    fart, a worthless, steaming
                    pile of cow dung.
          DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous
          LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who
          looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.

          

                                 MR. ALLAN
                    Marvelous! Marvelous! That's
                    what I love most about this
                    firm-- the collegial
                    atmosphere, the hearty good-
                    fellowship!
          Miranda is incensed.

                              MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
                    And thanks for those flowers
                    for my anniversary. My wife
                    loved them.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Well, I'm due in court... bye-
                    bye.

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a
          sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   .

          INT. COURTROOM


          
          CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands
          are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other
          table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole.

                                BAILIFF
                    All rise.
          They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.

                                JUDGE STEVENS
                   Counselors, are we ready to
                   begin?

          The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN
          and a NANNY.

                    --   until now.

          
          He collapses into his chair.

          
                          (to Falk, with

                           DETERMINATION)

          He begins to hyperventilate.     Virginia turns to Falk.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Wate r! Get him water!
          Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on.

                                FLETCHER
                    Fu-- fu--

                          BACK)
                    Try to relax! Breathe deeply!
          Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who
          downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING
          in PAIN. -

                               VIRGINIA (CONT'D)

                    I couldn't find any water, so
                    I got him coffee!
          Fletcher runs up and down the steps, frantically fanning
          h is scalded mouth. The bailiff appears.

                             BAILIFF
                   Judge is taking the bench.
          Fletcher's expression turns to terror.

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          The judge settles in. Mr. Allan and a smug Miranda look on
          from the gallery.

                             JUDGE STEVENS
                   You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .
          Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice
          quaking with fear...

          

                              VIRGINIA
                    Sorry. One of the kids threw
                    up in the car.
          Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children
          sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.

                    Well, it's working. I feel
                    sorry for them already.
          The judge BANGS the gavel.

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                    Ms. Appleton, you may begin.

                                                     CUT TO:
          Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator.
          Fletcher watches with mounting anxiety, NERVOUSLY DRINKS
          from a GLASS OF WATER at his table.

                              BRYSON
                         (referring to his

                          NOTES)
                    -- From March six through June
                    twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole
                    at the behest of Mr. Cole.
                    During that period, I noted
                    that Mr. Cole left each day
                    between seven-forty and seven-
                    fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole
                    would frequently have a male
                    visitor arrive and stay for
                    one to four hours. I was able
                    to take several photographs of
                    the male visitor.
          He shows a photo - - o f a strapping hunk. Fletcher TAKES A

          HUGE DRINK.           .

                              DANA
                    I see. And do you .know what
                    Mrs. Cole and her male visitor

          
                    did during their frequent...
                    visits?

                              BRYSON
                    Well, they were pretty good
                    about keeping the shades drawn
                    -- but I sure was able to
                    hear. I made an audiotape of
                    one such., "session."
          H e hands her the tape. Fletcher refills his glass.

                    With the Court's permission, I
                    would like to play the tape.

                              FLETCHER
                    Your Honor, I object!

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    And why is that, Mr. Reid?

                               FLETCHER
                          (can't help

                           HIMSELF)
                    Because it's devastating to my
                   ·case.
          The judge is startled by his candor.

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                    Overruled..
          As Dana pops the tape into a player, Fletcher anxiously

          DOWNS THE GLASS.
          Periodically CUTTING to Virginia, Mr. Cole, Dan and the
          thirsty Fletcher, we hear Virginia and her visitor engaged
          in intense physical activity.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                    So , what did you say? You
                    ready?

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Oh boy am I ready.

                             MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                   Good. Let me help you off
                   with that. Come on, lie down.

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                   Wai t a minute. Do you have
                   protection?

          

                               MALE VISITOR ( O . S . )
                    Right here. Okay, now I ' m
                    gonna show you something new.

                               VIRGINIA ( O . S . )
                    Oh, I've never done it like
                    this before.                    .·.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S.)
                    Don't worry, you can take it.
                    Oh yeah. That's it. There
                    you go. Yes! Yes!
          WE HEAR labored rhythmic breathing.

                              MALE VISITOR (O.S) (CONT'D)
                    Yes, yes, yes --
          As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
          more labored breathing, building intensity and --

                               MALE VISITOR (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Oh yeah, bring it on .home --
                    yes! Yes! Yes!

                              VIRGINIA (O.S.)
                    Yes! YES! YES!
          The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still
          moment. . .
          As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-
          nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the
          tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.

                              DANA
                    Your witness.

                               FLETCHER
                    No questions.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    No questions? .

                              VIRGINIA
                    No questions?

                                FLETCHER
                          (afraid to ask

                           ANY)
                    No questions.

                                DANA

                          (TRIUMPHANT)
                    Petitioner rests.

          

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    All right, Mr. Reid. You may
                    proceed.

                                 FLETCHER
                            (to himself)
                    How?!
          Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
          water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak...
          when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him.
          After a momement, he grins.

                              FLETCHER (CONT'D)
                    Would the Court be willing to
                    grant me a short bathroom
                    break?

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    It can't wait?

                              FLETCHER
                    Not unless you want to mop up.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS

                            (FRUSTRATED)
                    All right, but get back in
                    here immediately so .we can
                    finish this.
          Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.

          INT. REST ROOM - DAY

          Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak
          i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch.
          It's only 4:15. '

                                FLETCHER
                    What did I think? That I
                    could piss for forty-five
                    minutes?!
          He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.
          He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE
          WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally
          KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack.
          A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.

                              MAN
                    What's going on in-there?

          

                                FLETCHER (O . S . )
                    I ' m abusing myself! Do you
                    mind?!
          The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.

          INT. COURTROOM - DAY

          The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the
          severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED.

                              BAILIFF
                    I found him like this in the
                    bathroom. Somebody beat the
                    hell out of him.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Who did this?

                               FLETCHER

                          (TRUTHFULLY)
                    A madman, Your Honor.. A
                    desperate fool at the end of
                    his pitiful.rope.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   -What did he look like?

                              FLETCHER

                         (DESCRIBING

                          HIMSELF)
                    About five eleven, hundred
                    eighty-five pounds, crazed
                    look in his eye.

                                 JUDGE STEVENS
                    Bailiff, have the deputies
                    search the building.
          A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.

                             JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                   Under the circumstances, I
                   have no choice but to recess
                   this case until tomorrow
                   morning at nine.
          Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --

                              JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                    -- Unless, of course, you
                    think you can still proceed?
          Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid
          answering, but he can't repress the truth.

          

                                 JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D)
                    Can you?

                               FLETCHER
                    Yes, I can.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                    Splendid. I admire your
                    courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give
                    you a few minutes to compose
                    yourself, and then we'll get
                    started.
          Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.

          EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY

          Fletcher sits on the courthouse steps, miserable. PHONE

          RINGS.

                                 FLETCHER
                    Hello.

          INTERCUT WITH MAX AT HOME. AUDREY IS THERE.

                                 MAX
                    Dad...

                              FLETCHER
                         (summoning up

                          ENTHUSIASM)
                    Maxi-pad. How's it going?

                                 MAX
                    Great. You know Paul and
                    Emanuel from across the
                    street?

                                 FLETCHER
                    The twins.

                                MAX .

                           (EXCITEDLY)
                   Well, they never want to play
                   baseball with me, but I told
                   them I was gonna play tonight
                   with my Dad, so now they want
                   to play with us. Is it okay?

                                 FLETCHER
                   Sure.

          

                               MAX
                    Oh boy. We're setting up a
                    whole field in the yard.
                    Where we buried Petey the
                    hamster is second base.
                         (Fletcher sighs)
                    You're still coming right?'

                               FLETCHER
                          (sees Virginia

                           APPROACHING)
                    I'11 be there. I gotta go
                    now, Max. I'll see you in two
                    hours.
          Max hangs up.

                               MAX
                         (to Audrey)
                    He's really coming.
          She smiles, but she's worried. .

          COURTHOUSE STEPS

                                                                    ·

          
          Virginia approaches with her handsome lover, LAURENCE FALK.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Mr. Reid, you remember
                    Laurence Falk, the man from
                    the tape.

                              FALK
                    How are you?

                               FLETCHER
                    I've slipped into the seventh
                    circle of Hell, thank you, and
                    you?
          Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.

                               VIRGINIA
                    Shouldn't we go over our
                    testimony?

                               FLETCHER
                    Well, basically the plan is I
                    walk you through the tape step
                    by step, I ask you questions--

                               VIRGINIA
                    And we give the explanation
                    you came up with.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Exactly.

          

                                FALK
                    So all we have to do is lie.
                    Sounds simple enough.

                                FLETCHER
                    Do esn't it? And I'll finish
                    up with a dramatic series of
                    questions, something like...
                    "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that
                    you and Mrs. Cole have never
                    made lo--"
          But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The
          others look concerned, but he waves them off.

                              FLETHCER (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk,
                    isn't it true that you and
                    Mrs. Cole have never made lo--

                    IO-.H

          
          To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.

                                 FLETCHER
                            (to himself)
                    Oh my God! I can't do it! I
                    can't finish the question if I
                    know the answer is a lie!
          At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.

                                MR. ALLAN
                    Don't let me interrupt,
                    Fletcher. I just want you to
                    know I'll be observing this
                    a fternoon. Miranda insisted I
                    see you in action.
          Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.

                              MR. ALLAN (CONT'D)
                    I'm looking forward to it. Go
                    get 'em!

          
          Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving
          Fletcher more desperate than before.

                                FLETCHER
                   C'mon! Gotta rephrase the
                   question!

          

                                      FLETCHER
                         Respondent calls... Lawrence
                         Falk.
               Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...

                                      FLETCHER
                         Mr. Falk, do you know my

                         Isn't it true that your
                         relationship with my client is
                         entirely platonic, not?
               The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.

          A MURMUR erupts from the crowd.

                   of conscience!
          Fletcher suddenly stops -- focused on something Virginia
          said.

          and her passport.

          about her age. It says you
          were born in 1964. What's the
          truth? 1962? '60? How young

                    off!
          Mr. Allan gives Fletcher a thumbs-up; simultaneously,
          Miranda gives him the finger.

                                  JUDGE STEVENS
                    O r d e r ! Order!! Now i
                    understand both parties have
                    agreed to joint custody. Is
                    that correct?

          

                               FLETCHER AND DANA

                    YES--

                               VIRGINIA
                    No!   I'm contesting custody.

          
          Fletcher freezes.

                               FLETCHER
                    What?

                               VIRGINIA
                         (re: her husband)
                    Payback. For him trying to
                    prevent me from collecting my
                    thirty-seven million.

                               FLETCHER
                    He was entitled to prevent
                    you. You committed adultery.'
                    You only won because you're a
                    liar, remember? .

                               VIRGINIA
                   No. You pointed out that my
                   husband took advantage of a
                   poor underage girl. I was the
                   vic tim here. And now I'm
                   going to hit him where it
                   hurts.

                               FLETCHER
                    But -- but -- you said he was
                    a good father.

                              JUDGE STEVENS
                   M r. Reid? Do we have an
                   agreement on custody or not?
          Fletcher takes a distressed look at the children.

                               FLETCHER
                   No.                                            .

                               JUDGE STEVENS
                   In that case, there will be a
                   custody hearing tomorrow
                   mor ning at nine. Court is
                   adj ourned!
          He BANGS THE GAVEL. Everyone gets up, but Fletcher's
          attention is drawn to a commotion between Virginia and her
          kids.

          

                                    VIRGINIA
                          Stop that! We're leaving now!

                                    CHILD

           .-
                Fletcher watches, horrified, as she drags the kids away
                from their tearful father.

                                    MR. COLE
                          Don't worry. I'll see you no
                          matter what. I promise.
                Mr. Allan has made his way up to Fletcher.

                                     MR. ALLAN
                                (re: the

                                 COMMOTION)
                          I love kids. They give you so
                          much leverage in a case like
                          this.
                               (pats Fletcher on

                          Congratulations, partner. how
                          does it feel?
                And with that question asked, as he watches poor Mr. Cole
                and his kids, the truth dawns on Fletcher like a
                sledgehammer!

                                     FLETCHER '
                          Excuse me. Just a second.

                          wins ?! What are we, nuts?
                Everyone stops, watches Fletcher.

                          T his woman --my client --
                          goes down with the frequency
                          of a nuclear submarine and we
                          just gave her thirty seven
                          million dollars because she's
                          a liar! And now as an extra
                          added little bonus, we're
                          going to let her steal, the

                   to ask yourself, why do people
                   hate us? Could it be because

          EXT. AUDREY'S PORCH -'DAY


          
          A sad Max is seated on the steps. TWO other BOYS are there
          with baseball equipment.

          

                               PAUL
                    We're going home.

                              EMMANUEL
                    Yeah, thanks for the great
                    game, Max.
          Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from
          the door. She goes and sits by her son.

                              AUDREY
                    Max, honey. Your dad had a
                    very big case today. It
                    probably just--

                              MAX
                    I don't want to talk about it.

                              AUDREY
                    Okay.

                              MAX

                         (SUDDENLY)
                    I hate dad! I hate him!

                              AUDREY
                    Honey, don^t say that.
          Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The
          look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a
          decision.

                              AUDREY
                    Max, there's something I-want
                    to talk to you about. . .

          There's a happy/crazedness to him now. The truth is
          pouring forth, but he looks way, way off the deep end.

          INT. AUDREY'S KITCHEN -- DAY

          Max and Audrey at the table. The airline tickets Jerry
          gave her are in front of them.

                                MAX
                      When would we move?

                                 AUDREY
                      Soon. My semester's almost
                      over. You only have a week
                      left of school... You like
                      Jerry don't you?
                            (he nods)
                      So what do you say, should we
                      check it out? Jerry wants us
                      to come with him tonight. He
                      has to pick out a place to
                      live and he really wants our
                      help?

                                 MAX
                      Could I get a sled for when it
                      snows?

                                AUDREY
                      Of course you can.
          Max thinks, then:

                                 MAX
                      Okay.

                   Fifteen years of being stuck
                   in a lie is nowhere near as

                    time!
          Fletcher runs up and HUGS the astonished man,

                                FLETCHER

                    PHILIP!!   LOOK AT YOU!!! MY

                    PHILIP!!

          
          Fletcher KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.

          INT. PHILIP'S CAR - DAY

          Philip's driving Fletcher.

                              FLETCHER
                    You're saving my life, Philip.

                              PHILIP
                    You know, it's funny, but for
                    some reason I was beginning to
                    think you didn't like me.
                    Isn't that silly?

                               FLETCHER .
                    No. It's not silly.       I don't
                    like you.

                               PHILIP
                    What?

                               FLETCHER
                   I don't like you. I'm sorry.
                   I find you boring. I hate
                   ch ara des . And you wouldn't
                   know a good time if it sat on
                   your face.
                          (feels bad)
                   I'm sorry. It was easier than
                   telling you how I really felt.
                   Are you upset?
          A moment, then:

                               PHILIP
                   No. To be honest, I don't
                   like you either. You treat
                   people like obstacles and you
                   cheat at charades. .

          

                                FLETCHER
                     Then why are you always trying
                     to socialize with me?

                                PHILIP
                     You're a client. I figured if
                     I didn't try to be your
                     friend, you'd get a new
                     accountant.

                                FLETCHER
                     Philip, I don't like you as a
                     person, but I'm crazy about
                     you as my accountant. I ' d
                     never hire a new accountant.
                     Never!

                               PHILIP
                     So we don't have to like each
                     other anymore?

                               FLETCHER    -
                     Not at all.

                 .              PHILIP
                     All right. Sooner I get you
                     ·to the airport, sooner I can
                     dump your sorry ass off.

          EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY

          Philip's car skids to a stop.    Fletcher jumps out.

          INT. LAX TERMINAL - DAY .


          
          Fletcher races in.

                                FLETCHER
                     Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog,
                     rain, something, anything...
          He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD
                " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17."
          Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!!

          INT. LAX ESCALATOR

          Fletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past
          people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says

          STAND ON RIGHT.

          

                                 FLETCHER
                    Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come
                    on folks, let's let the
                    frantic man pass... Sorry...
                    Thank... you... Standing on
                    the right, passing on the
                    left. They can't make this-
                    deal any easier than it is...
                    Come on... coming through...
          At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money...

                                 FLETCHER
                         (speeding past)
                   I don't trust you. I don't
                   know what the hell that
                   uniform is. Sorry.
                        (a Hare Krishna
                          tries to stop

                         HIM)

                   NOT NOW, TOGA BOY!

          INT. LAX - SECURITY AREA

          Fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector.
          Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM.

                              INSPECTOR
                    Please step through again.

                                FLETCHER
                   Ahhh!! !    Damn..;
          Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex
          into a tray.
          He tries again.     It BUZZES again!

                              FLETCHER
                   What? I'tii practically naked!
          A guy in a TURBAN passes over him with a DETECTOR WAND.

          

                              FLETCHER
                    It's called a ZIPPER, Hodgy...

          
          The wand BEEPS over Fletchers front pocket. He reaches in
          and pulls out the now familiar BLUE PEN...

          

          INT. LAX - DEPARTURE CONCOURSE


          
          Fletcher races by Gate 15, 16, gets to 1 7 . . . but sees the
          PLANE Slowly TAXIING AWAY.

                                  FL E TC H ER
                    N ooo!!!
          Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT".    Goes for it
          when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts.

                              FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                    Can I help you?

                               FLETCHER
                    Look out!! ! --

                          (TRUTHFUL)

                    -NOTHING'S COMING!!
          The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And
          Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!

          EXT. TARMAC - DAY

          He scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane
          which is moving away.
          No way he'll catch it.
          Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT
          (These are the steps they pull up to planes) Fletcher gets
          an insane idea. . .
          The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER
          in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.

                                  WORKER
                    Hey!!      Hey!!!!
          But Fletcher's gone.

          EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY


          
          Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the
          plane. GROUND WORKERS react.
          Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.
          Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low
          to see in the plane.
          He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on
          the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS

          THE STEPS!

          
          The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.

          INT. AIRPLANE - DAY - MOVING


          
          PASSENGERS calmly read while outside FLETCHER speeds along,
          WAVING HIS ARMS like a maniac. The ENGINE NOISE drowns out
          his call for...

          

                                   F LET CH ER

                    MA X ? !!   AUDREYY?!!

          
          A STEWARDESS stands in the aisle, giving the safety
          lecture.

                                   STEWARDESS
                    In case of a water landing,
                    please use your seat cushion

                    AS--
          ·Her MOUTH DROPS as she notices Fletcher.

          EXT. TARMAC - DAY

          Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane
          POINT, STARE in amazement.
          Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO
          THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.
          At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS.
          He surfs under the wing...
          ...    and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side.
          Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally
          spots. . .

          MAX, AUDREY AND JERRY SEATED IN THE BULKHEAD
          Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him.
          Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his
          seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER.
          Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO

          NOISY.
          Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!

          FLETCHER'S POV
          The RUNWAY is ENDING!.

          
          Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now
          trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.

          

                                    AUDREY
                          (checks under his

                           SEAT)
                     It's right here, honey.

                                    M AX
                     Mom!   Mom!!               '

                               AUDREY
                     Just a second, Max.

                               MAX
                     Mom, it's dad!

                               AU DREY
                     W hat? What about dad?
          Audrey turns. Then she sees Fletcher WAVING weakly...

                                  AUDREY
                     Fletcher?!

          AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN!
          BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading ·
          right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE

          CART. . -
          And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!

          
          Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A

          MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE!

          CLOSE ON FLETCHER

          
          With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's
          in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.

                                                      CUT TO:

          INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT


          
          Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED.
          He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.

                                FLETCHER
                           (mumbles to

                            HIMSELF)
                     Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes
                     indeed.

                                DEPUTY
                     Mr. Reid. Someone made bail
                     for you.

          

          EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT


          
          Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a
          shoe, and still holding the compress.

                               FLETCHER

                          (WEAKLY)
                    Greta? Is that you?
          He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY
          waiting for him just outside the door.
          Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY.
          He sees his dad, then quickly turns away.

                              FLETCHER
                         (to Audrey and
                          Jerry, trying to
                          seem chipper)
                   Sorry I made you miss your
                   flight, not really.
                         (no response)
                   You're obviously a little
                 . upset, not that I blame you...
                   although I'll bet you'll still
                   get the bonus miles. . .

                              AUDREY
                    Fletcher, are you crazy?
                    What were you doing?

                              FLETC HER
                    That's two questions. A; Yes,
                    but I think the legal term is
                    temporarily insane. And B; I
                    was trying to finally have
                    that talk with you about
                    Boston.
          Audrey's patience are growing thin...

                              FLETCHER
                   Okay, okay... The whole truth
                   and nothing but the truth,
                        (with difficulty,

                         SINCERELY)
                   I tried to stop the plane
                   because it was taking off with
                   my life... you and Max.
          This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher
          said, but the way he said it.

          

                               FLETCHER
                    I know you've met somebody...
                    somebody pretty great... and
                    the truth is I wish you didn't
                    but you did and... All I ' m
                    asking i s . . . Please don't move
                    to Boston. Please don't take
                    Max away.
          She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced.

                               AUDREY
                    You can come visit anytime.
                    It's only a four hour flight.

                               FLETCHER
                    I don't want to visit him.
                    That's what I've been doing--
                    visiting him, dropping by,
                    stopping in. I want to be in
                    his life. I don't want to be
                    some jerk that sees him at
                    Easter. I want to be his
                    father.
          Fletcher turns to Jerry.

                               FLETCHER
                   I know I have no right to ask,
                   but can I talk you out of
                   taki ng that job? I can get
                   you a better job here in L.A.
                   I've got all kinds of
                   connect ions... what do you do
                   again?

                              JERRY
                    I design security systems.

                               FLETCHER
                    How symbolic. Okay great.
                    You know Pac-Tec?

                             JERRY
                   The biggest.

                               FLETCHER
                   One of their systems shorted
                   out and burned down a
                   supermarket. I got them off.
                   Another proud day for justice.
                   If I ask them they'll beat
                   your Boston offer in two
                   s ec on ds .    ..

          

                               AUDREY
                    Don't put Jerry in the middle.

                               JERRY
                    It's okay.
                          (to Fletcher)
                    Boston means this
                          (snaps his

                           FINGERS)
                    to me. All I want is for this
                    lady and Max to be happy.
                    Preferably, with me. Whatever
                    they want, I'll go along with.
          They both look to Audrey.

                              AUDREY
                    All I want is for Max to be
                    happy.
          Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. He's still upset.

                              AUDREY
                    You better know your jury.
                    You're hot exactly Max's hero
                    today.

                              FLETCHER
                    Just let me present my case.
          Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

          TALKING LIKE THE TERMINATOR.

                                FLETCHER/TERMINATOR
                    I have been sent from the
                    future to destroy you. . .
                    Argghhh!
                         (no response, a

                          BEAT)
                    You mad at me?
          Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:

                               FLETCHER
                    You wanted me to stop lying.
                    But lying isn't the problem. ..
                    Why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. Sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    But sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          (touches him)
                    But being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for more

          
                    important things. Much more
                    important things. I was so
                    stupid, Max.
                          (pointing to his
                           own head)
                    Malfunction in vector one.
                    All this time you've been here
                    and I could see you anytime I
                    felt like it. And I...
                    didn't. Please don't go to
                    Boston. Max, I love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    I couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. Not today.
          A moment as Max studies his father, then:

                              MAX
                          (to Audrey)
                    He's telling the truth, Mom.
                    He's not allowed to lie. I
                    made a wish and anything Dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                          (to Fletcher) ..
                    Right?
          But Fletcher's looking at his watch...

                               FLETCHER
                    Max. .. it's 9:22.

                              AUDREY
                    What?

                              FLETCHER
                    Max, you made the wish at
                    9:15. I've been able to lie
                    for the last seven minutes.
          Max steps away from Fletcher.

                              MAX
                    So then, you were...

                              FLETCHER
                    No! It wasn't a lie. I just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    You just have to believe me.
          Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
          Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.

          

                                       MAX
                          (to Audrey)
                     Mommy... do we have to go to
                     Boston?
          Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.

                                   AUDR EY
                     No.      We don't have to.
          Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
          never let you go."

                                       MAX
                          (to Fletcher)
                     Can we play catch tomorrow?
          Fletcher smiles. . .

          EXT. PARK - DAY

          A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...

                                       M AX
                     Dad! !

                                       FLETCH ER
                     Ma x i mu m ! !
          Fletcher picks Max up.

                                       MAX
                    Transformer!!! .
          Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...

                                       FLETCHER
                     Malfunction in vector seven.
                     I have lost control of my
                     affection reflex...
          Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
          sees Audrey.

                                       FLETCHER
                     Procreate!          Procreate!

                                   AUDREY

                              (PLAYFULLY)
                     Fletcher... You're gonna lose
                     a limb--

          

                              MAX
                    Come on, dad, let's play
                    catch!!

                              FLETCHER
                    Sr. . .

                    UE
                          (starts to toss

                           MAX)
                    Here you go, mom.
                          (Max screams)
                    Oh, you mean with a ball...
          He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.

                              FLETCHER
                    I take back every dirty,
                    dishonest thing I ever said
                    about you, wrote about you,
                    faxed about you, E-mailed
                    about you.

                              JERRY
                    Appreciated.
          Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.

                              FLETCHER
                    So, you up for a little
                    friendly competition?

                             JERRY
                   No, you go play with your son.

                              FLETCHER
                   I wasn't talking about
                   basesball.
          A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the
          ball to Max.

                              FLETCHER
                         (to Max)
                   Alright, it's time to show you
                   the old Fletcher Reid change up.

          
          Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then
          instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP.
          Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.
          There may be better things in life... but at this moment,
          it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.
          

          

                              THE END
"LIVING IN OBLIVION"

                                      SHOOTING DRAFT

                                           1995

                

               A battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod 
               surrounded by blackness. Opening credits begin. An almost 
               imperceptible DOLLY in toward the movie camera. The dolly 
               forward continues throughout the credits ending in an EXTREME 
               CU of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, 
               glass full moon. Fade to BLACK.

               Suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping 
               the lens and revealing the following scene in Black and White.

               EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT

               A quiet, deserted industrial street. It is over an hour before 
               dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness 
               of night.

               In the weak light filtering out of their battered van, BERT 
               and CYBIL -- the Craft Service Managers, finish setting out 
               breakfast supplies on a 6' table. They work in almost complete 
               silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. A cheap walkie-
               talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy Oreos, sputters 
               and buzzes occasionally. Other items on the table include a 
               mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered 
               donuts.

                                     BERT
                         What time is it?

                                     CYBIL
                         Four. Why?

                                     BERT
                         This milk is bad.

                                     CYBIL
                              (sniffs)
                         When did you buy it?

                                     BERT
                         Tuesday? I don't know. What's today?

                                     CYBIL
                         Monday.
                              (pause)
                         There's a deli on Broadway.

                                     BERT
                         Nothing closer?

                                     CYBIL
                         Nothing that's open.

                                     BERT
                              (sniffs the milk)
                         Is it that bad?

                                     CYBIL
                         I don't know. You're the one who 
                         said it was bad.

               At that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and 
               shudders to a stop in front of the building. Bert replaces 
               the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.

               EXT. STREET. NYC. NIGHT. B/W

               Amid low, one-word greetings, the CREW tumbles out of the 
               trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the Craft Service 
               table. WOLF -- the Cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. 
               He wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black 
               leather half-fingered gloves.

                                     WOLF
                         This is the worst fucking coffee 
                         I've had in my life.

                                     CYBIL
                         Then don't drink it.

                                     GAFFER
                         What're we doing today?

                                     WOLF
                              (pulls out a wrinkled 
                              callsheet)
                         "Interior. Living Room. Ellen talks

                         Yeah, you have to take your fucking 
                         pants off.

                                     AC
                         I'll do it. I like Ellen.

                         Yeah, she's a babe. She was the nurse 
                         in that Richard Gere movie.

                                     BERT
                         I worked on that.

                         living room.

                         Two people. Sitting? Standing?

                                     WOLF
                         Who fuckin' knows?

                                     GAFFER
                              (walks off)
                         "Ellen talks to Mom."

               INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W

               NICOLE sits quietly in the back seat of a beat-up station 
               wagon. She glances out at the empty city moving past her 
               window and lets out a deep sigh.

               JEFF, the young intern assigned as her driver, glances into 
               the rearview mirror.

                                     JEFF
                         Tired?

                                     NICOLE
                         No, I've been up since four. I've 
                         got a big scene today and I'm kind 
                         of nervous.

                                     JEFF
                         "Ellen talks to Mom."

                                     NICOLE
                         Have you read the script?

                                     JEFF
                         No. It's on the callsheet.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh. Well, it's pretty emotional. I 
                         tell my mother I never felt she really 
                         loved me.

                                     JEFF
                         You're going to yell at each other?

                                     NICOLE
                         I don't know. I'm just going to go 
                         with how I feel. Which is the scary 
                         part. I'm very close to this 
                         character.

                                     JEFF
                         Problems with your own mom?

                                     NICOLE
                         Yes. But she died before I, well 
                         before we could reconcile...

                                     JEFF
                         You were great in that Richard Gere 
                         movie.

                                     NICOLE
                         Thanks.

               EXT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL. NIGHT. B/W

               CU sidewalk. A pair of women's orthopedic shoes enter the 
               frame and begin pacing.

               Camera pans up to reveal CORA, a small woman in her early 
               60s, pacing beneath the awning of her residential hotel. She 
               appears to be rehearsing dialogue with herself.

                                     CORA
                         Ellen, I have no memory of this 
                         whatsoever. Ellen... Ellen I have NO 
                         memory of this whatsoever.

               Jeff pulls the car up to the curb and Cora gets into the 
               back seat.

               INT. CAR. NIGHT. B/W

                                     NICOLE
                         Good morning, "Mom."

                                     CORA
                              (gruff)
                         Morning.

                                     NICOLE
                         Sleep well?

                                     CORA
                         Not a wink.

               Cora immediately lights a cigarette. Nicole instinctively 
               wrinkles her nose and turns away. Cora notices this and makes 
               an exaggerated effort to keep the smoke away from Nicole by 
               blowing it hard out the side of her mouth. Jeff glances back 
               at the two women in the rearview mirror. No one speaks.

               INT. SET. DAWN. B/W

               NICK -- the Director, WOLF -- the Cameraman and WANDA -- the 
               AD, stand in a loose triangle on the darkened set. All are 
               holding coffee cups. The Gaffer can be seen in the background 
               fumbling with a light.

                                     NICK
                         Look, I'm not blaming anybody, Wanda. 
                         I'm just saying we left last night 
                         and I knew we didn't get that scene.

                                     WANDA
                         I'm sorry, I thought it was a great 
                         scene, Nick.

                                     NICK
                         It was OK; and it's going to be 
                         alright. But I'm not settling for OK 
                         today. This is a big scene and I'm 
                         not leaving till we get it.

                                     WANDA
                         Whatever it takes, Nick. We're here 
                         for you.

                                     NICK
                         Alright, here's what I'm thinking. 
                         Wolf, I want to do the whole scene 
                         in one shot.

                                     WOLF
                         It's been done.

                                     NICK
                         I know that but I'd like to try it 
                         anyway.

                                     WOLF
                         Handheld.

                                     NICK
                         No, dolly. We go from Close-up to 
                         Wide-shot and back to Close-up in 
                         the same shot.

                                     WOLF
                         I'll use the 35, minimize distortion; 
                         I'll light it all from the ceiling. 
                         It could be kind of great.

                                     WANDA
                         Sounds incredible. How long, Wolf?

                                     WOLF
                         I'll need to see a couple run-
                         throughs.

                                     NICK
                         Not too many. It's a tough scene for 
                         the actors. I want them to feel 
                         relaxed, fresh...

                                     WANDA
                         We've got all day, Nick. Whatever it 
                         takes. What do you think, Wolf -- an 
                         hour, 45?

                                     WOLF
                         I don't know how you drink that shit 
                         black, Nick. I got to dump in the 
                         milk. It's the only way I can cut 
                         the taste.

               Suddenly the Gaffer turns on the 5K, flooding the room with 
               harsh, blinding light.

                                     NICK
                         Jesus!

                                     WOLF
                         What the fuck?!

                                     WANDA
                         Flame on, asshole!!

               The screen goes completely WHITE.

               INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

               Screen is still white. Gradually it shifts back to proper 
               exposure revealing NICOLE in Medium CU. Her eyes are riveting; 
               it is obvious she is emotionally primed for the scene. A 
               light meter is thrust in front of her face. She barely 
               registers it.

               WS, the entire Living Room set. Nicole sits on a sofa facing 
               Cora seated opposite in an overstuffed chair. Two flats have 
               been joined at right angles to create the Living Room corner. 
               A table lamp and assorted framed photographs complete the 
               rather scrawny looking set.

               Most of the movie crew is seen, including Wolf looking through 
               the camera.

                                     WANDA
                         OK, picture's up. Quiet. Stop the 
                         work. Lock it up. Going for picture.

               Nick approaches Nicole and Cora.

                                     NICK
                         OK, nice and easy. Cora you're doing 
                         fine. Remember, really listen and 
                         really answer.
                              (smiles at Nicole)
                         I've got nothing to say to you. Just 
                         let it happen. It's all there.

                                     WANDA
                         Ready, Nick?

                                     WOLF
                         Look at this a second, Nick.

               Nick moves behind the camera and looks through the eyepiece. 
               Another CU of Nicole fills the frame. The image is visually 
               and emotionally breathtaking.

                                     WOLF
                         I pushed in a foot. She's incredible. 
                         It's coming right through the lens.

               Nick grips Wolf's shoulder in gratitude.

                                     NICK
                         That's great, man. Beautiful.

                                     WANDA
                         Ready, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         Let's go. Right away.

                                     WANDA
                         And, roll sound.

                         Speed!

                                     WANDA
                         And, roll camera!

                                     AC
                         Rolling!

                                     NICK
                         Action.

               INT. APT. THE SCENE: TAKE 1. COLOR

               From the moment Nick calls "action" the film will cut directly 
               to the shot the set camera is filming. The shot is fluid, 
               graceful and in richly, beautiful COLOR. Nicole's performance 
               is very strong; flawed only slightly by her nervousness.

                                     NICOLE
                         Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         It didn't hurt that much but I started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. He went over and started 
                         hitting Danny.

                                     CORA
                         Ellen, I have no memory of this 
                         whatsoever.

                                     NICOLE
                         You were just standing there looking 
                         at me. Then you pulled me up and 
                         said, "You're not hurt." Like I was 
                         disgusting for faking, for doing the 
                         only thing I could think of to keep 
                         him from hitting me again.

                                     CORA
                         I was worried about Danny.

                                     NICOLE
                         You do remember.

                                     CORA
                         He was smaller than you.

               Nicole turns to Cora with the heartbreaking gaze of an 
               abandoned child. Nick and the rest of the crew watch in awe.

                                     NICOLE
                         You were so worried about Danny --

               Suddenly the BOOM dips all the way into the shot.

               INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

                                     WOLF
                         Cut! Boom in. Sorry, I had to cut. 
                         Les, your boom was all the way in 
                         the shot.

                                     BOOM
                         Well, where's the frame line?

               All the crew move around, all talking at once.

                                     WANDA
                         OK, can we get a frame line? Hold it 
                         down. We're going again right away. 
                         Nobody moves. Les, you got the frame

               Suddenly a car stops right outside, a heavy, bass-driven rap

               man who appears to be following the music with the mike,

               losing her concentration.

                         Dad hit me first and knocked me down. 
                         It didn't hurt that much but I started 
                         crying anyway, hoping he would leave 
                         me alone. He went over and started 
                         hitting Danny.

               Suddenly there is a tremendous EXPLOSION sending bits of 
               glass flying through the frame. Cora jumps, clutching her 
               chest.

               Nick, Cora, and Nicole stand in a corner of the landing. 
               Nick is making obvious attempts to lighten the mood.

                         I have no doubt about it. Nicole...

               Nick turns to Nicole and stops in midsentence. He looks at 
               her for a long moment. Nicole returns his gaze then suddenly 
               looks away.

               Nick moves off. Wanda stares at Wolf who studiously inspects 
               his light meter.

               As the scene begins again, it is obvious that both actresses 
               are completely distracted. Nick's face betrays a rapidly 
               increasing anxiety.

               Nicole gets up quietly and sits next to Cora on the couch, 
               wordlessly taking her hand in hers.

                                     CORA

                         Cora, don't even think that. You're 
                         doing great. I'm the one who's fucking 
                         it up. If I get through this I swear 
                         I'm never acting again.

               She means it. Cora glances up at her, seeing for the first 
               time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from Nicole's 
               face. On an impulse Cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand 
               of Nicole's hair from her eyes.

               A sudden amazed alarm fills Nicole. The living room grows 
               strangely quiet.

               the open door of the hospital room.

               CU Nicole, seated on the edge of the hospital bed. Still 
               confused, she looks down at the old woman lying in the bed. 
               The woman's face is pale and drawn. As Nicole leans closer 
               her mother reaches out and gently brushes a strand of hair 
               away from her face. The gesture is one of love, acceptance, 
               and farewell. It is identical to the one we have just seen 
               Cora make to her.

               standing quietly. Nicole glances over at Cora and instantly 
               something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. The 
               run-through begins.

               From the moment Nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there 
               has been a remarkable change in her. Every word now has the 
               stunning clarity of truth. Cora is completely engulfed in 
               the moment.

               As Nicole continues, one by one the crew turn and watch this 
               exquisite moment happening before them. Nick's face is lit 
               with rapture.

               He glances over and to his horror sees that no one is behind 
               the camera. He whispers frantically to the AC.

                                     NICK
                         Where's Wolf?

                                     AC
                              (whispers)
                         In the bathroom... he doesn't feel 
                         good.

                                     NICK
                              (whispers)
                         Get him! Get him!

               Nick turns back to the scene, watching its beauty now in 
               agony.

                                     NICOLE
                         Then you pulled me up and said, 
                         "You're not hurt." Like I was 
                         disgusting for faking, for doing the 
                         only thing I could think of to keep 
                         him from hitting me again.

                                     CORA
                         I was worried about Danny.

                                     NICOLE
                         You do remember.

                                     CORA
                         He was smaller than you.

                                     NICOLE
                         You were so worried about Danny. 
                         What about me, Mom? Why weren't you 
                         worried about me?

               There is a heavy, stunned silence as the scene ends. Nicole 
               and Cora are in each other's arms. Pam and Cybil share a 
               piece of tissue. CUT TO: an extreme CU of Nick.

                                     NICK
                         Where the fuck is Wolf?!!!

               INT. BATHROOM. DAY. B/W

               In the cramped confines of the dingy basement bathroom, Wolf 
               pukes violently into the toilet. His face is pale and slick 
               with perspiration. His eyes look upward toward the sound of 
               Nick yelling.

                                     WOLF
                         One second!

               Wolf tries to continue but another spasm of nausea wrenches 
               him back toward the toilet bowl.

               INT. SET APT. THE COUCH. DAY. B/W

               The set is quiet, subdued. Nick sits on the couch with Nicole 
               and Cora. Wolf sits groggily behind the camera wiping the 
               sweat from his face. Wanda addresses the crew.

                                     WANDA
                         OK, listen up. Nobody drinks the 
                         milk downstairs. OK? It appears to 
                         be bad.

               Nick speaks uneasily to Nicole and Cora. He is a wreck and 
               his insistent smile of encouragement looks absolutely 
               demented.

                                     NICK
                         I've had to, well I've changed the 
                         shot; we're just a little pressed 
                         for time. It'll just be a CU of Ellen 
                         for the last part of the scene, 
                         starting with Cora's "I was worried 
                         about Danny." OK? I'll find a way to 
                         cut this into the fourth take. We 
                         almost had it. That was unbelievable, 
                         both of you. But let's not think 
                         about it. That moment is gone, and... 
                         we'll, we'll get another one. I have 
                         no doubt about it. OK? Here we go.

               Nick walks over and stands beside the camera.

               INT. SET APT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY. B/W

                                     WOLF
                         I'm ready, Nick.

               Nick is so angry he can't even look at Wolf.

                                     NICK
                         Call it, Wanda.

                                     WANDA
                         And, roll sound.

                                     WANDA
                         And, roll camera!

                                     AC
                         Rolling!

                              (hits the sticks)

                                     NICK
                         Action.

               INT. SET APT. THE SCENE: PICKUP 1. COLOR

               The scene begins at the pickup point. Miraculously, both 
               Cora and Nicole are just as concentrated and engaged as they 
               were in the run-through.

                                     CORA
                         I was worried about Danny.

                                     NICOLE
                         You do remember.

                                     CORA
                         He was smaller than you.

                                     NICOLE
                         You were so worried about Danny. 
                         What about me, Mom? Why weren't --

               In the middle of this final, delicate moment an insistent 
               electronic beeping is heard.

               INT. SET APT. DAY. B/W

                                     NICK
                         CUT!!!!

                                     WANDA
                         What the fuck is that?! Sound?

                                     SOUND
                              (frantically checking 
                              his equipment)
                         It's not me.

                                     BOOM
                         It's the camera.

                                     WOLF
                         The fuck it is. It's off; it's not 
                         even running.

               The beep continues, growing louder.

                                     WANDA
                              (into her walkie)
                         What's going on down there?! Do I 
                         have a lock-up?! Nothing? You don't 
                         hear a beeping sound?
                              (to Nick)
                         The street's quiet.

                                     NICK
                         Then what the fuck is it!!?

                                     AC
                         It's somebody's watch!

               Everybody holds their watches up to their ears.

                                     WOLF
                         Not mine.

                                     WANDA
                         Not mine.

                                     SOUND
                         Not mine.

                                     BOOM
                         Not mine.

               And so on, until all watches have been checked with negative 
               results. The beeping continues, growing louder and louder.

               Suddenly Nick loses it. He starts running around the set, 
               ripping things apart, knocking over tables, lamps, chairs. 
               He shoves Cora off the couch and whips off the cushions, 
               heaving them against the wall with a startling violence.

                                     NICK
                         Where is it!! You motherfucker! You 
                         cock-sucking motherfucking bastard! 
                         Where the fuck are you!? Where!! 
                         Where!!

               Everyone watches Nick demolish the set in stunned, open-
               mouthed amazement. Nick turns to the crew in rage.

                                     NICK
                         Can someone help me please?! Do I 
                         have to do everything myself here?!

               Nick loses it completely.

                                     NICK
                         Hey, Cora. Why don't you go learn 
                         your lines! Hey Scriptgirl, are you 
                         finally going to pay attention here?! 
                         Hey, focus puller, you want to make 
                         a movie or get stoned?! Huh, I got 
                         some great fuckin' Thai Stick here! 
                         Hey Wolf, you pretentious, beret-
                         wearing motherfucker! I saw your 
                         reel, man; it sucked! Who the hell 
                         would hire you anyway! Hey Wanda, 
                         next time can you wear a shirt that's 
                         a little more distracting to my 
                         actors!
                              (to the Gaffer)
                         Hey Bob! Hi Bob! Can you please make 
                         a little more noise on the dolly you 
                         creaky motherfucker!
                              (to Cybil)
                         What is your name!? What do you 
                         fucking do around here?!
                              (to the Soundman)
                         Hey Speedo, what's the matter? Can't 
                         even find a teeny fucking beep?!

               CU of Nicole. She turns away, unable to watch anymore. The 
               beeping continues.

                                     NICK
                         See what I have to put up with, 
                         Nicole!? Maybe next time you'll do 
                         some of that magic on camera!? But 
                         no, no -- wait till Wolf is puking 
                         his guts out, "Oh now I'll be good!!"

               WS, the entire room. Nick's last word echoes throughout the 
               silent set. Suddenly he stops in the center of the demolished 
               set and lets out a long, wrenching scream.

               INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT. COLOR

               QUICK CUT TO extreme CU Nick's face, just as his eyes open. 
               The film is in COLOR now. The room is in heavy darkness except 
               for the light on Nick's face. Nick reaches over and shuts 
               off his clock radio. The digital dial shows 4:00 A.M. The 
               beeping finally stops.

               Nick turns on a light and sits up in bed, drenched in sweat 
               and still breathing heavily.

                                     NICK
                         God...
                              (this is not a sigh 
                              of relief)

               The camera DOLLIES swiftly back away from Nick. He stares at 
               it in stunned amazement. Just then a DOOR closes right into 
               the lens turning the frame into complete BLACKNESS.

               Out of the BLACKNESS a door opens away from the camera 
               revealing WANDA looking into her closet (the camera is inside 
               the closet). From this point on, the rest of the film is in 
               COLOR except where specifically indicated to be Black and 
               White.

               INT. WANDA'S APT. DAWN

               She is wearing only a bra, black stretch pants, and cowboy 
               boots. She rummages quickly through some blouses, selects 
               the same garish one she wore in Part One, then walks away 
               revealing WOLF sitting on the edge of the rumpled bed. He is 
               dressed exactly the same as when we last saw him, complete 
               with beret. He struggles groggily into his socks and boots. 
               The entire apartment is in disarray. A bedside clock reads 
               4:13 A.M.

                                     WOLF
                         Well, when did he ask you?

                                     WANDA
                         Yesterday, when I was helping him 
                         check into his hotel.

                                     WOLF
                         What, the guy can't even check into 
                         a hotel by himself?

                                     WANDA
                         Listen, Wolf, having Chad Palomino 
                         in this movie will benefit us all. 
                         If being there when he checks into 
                         his hotel makes him feel better, 
                         then I'm happy to do it.

                                     WOLF
                         Well, how did it come up?

                                     WANDA
                         He asked me if I liked jazz, I said 
                         yes, and he suggested we meet tonight 
                         at a jazz club.

                                     WOLF
                         I like jazz.

                                     WANDA
                         He did not invite you.
                              (applies perfume)

                                     WOLF
                         Why are you wearing perfume to work?

                                     WANDA
                         Because I feel like it.

                                     WOLF
                         You didn't wear it yesterday.

                                     WANDA
                         Oh, stop it. You're acting like a 
                         child.

               Wanda playfully swipes at Wolf's face with a negligee she is 
               returning to the closet. It misses him completely.

                                     WOLF
                         My eye!

                                     WANDA
                         Oh, God. Sweetheart, are you alright?

                                     WOLF
                         Do I look alright?!

                                     WANDA
                         Let me see. Christ, we're going to 
                         be late.

               Wanda sits and perfunctorily examines Wolf's eye.

               INT. CAR. DAWN

               The car is parked outside a rather seedy hotel. JEFF, the 
               Intern and NICK, the Director, sit quietly in the motionless 
               car.

                                     NICK
                         Should we call up to the room again?

                                     JEFF
                         He said he'd be right down.

               Nick lets out a huge yawn.

                                     JEFF
                         Tired?

                                     NICK
                         I'm exhausted. I dreamt I was on the 
                         set all night. I was just trying to 
                         do one shot and everything kept going 
                         wrong.

                                     JEFF
                         That's an anxiety dream. Are you 
                         anxious about something?

                                     NICK
                         I don't know. Sometimes I wonder 
                         what the hell I'm doing in this 
                         business. It's all just one compromise 
                         and disappointment after another. I 
                         don't know if I have the personality 
                         for it.

                                     JEFF
                         Sounds kind of like an identity 
                         crisis.

                                     NICK
                         Maybe you're right. Who am I? What 
                         am I really capable of? Maybe I should 
                         just get a job teaching at a women's 
                         college somewhere.

                                     JEFF
                         How'd you get into cinematography?

                                     NICK
                         I'm not a cinematographer.

                                     JEFF
                         You're not?

                                     NICK
                         No. I'm directing this movie.

                                     JEFF
                              (pause)
                         How'd you get into directing?

               INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN

               In the dim light of the hotel room, CHAD PALOMINO dresses 
               quickly. He is young, handsome, with long blond hair. A WOMAN 
               sits nude on the bed, her back to the camera. The faint sound 
               of a shower comes from the adjacent bathroom.

                                     PALOMINO
                         They're waiting downstairs.

                                     WOMAN
                         Go ahead, I'll take a taxi.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Oh, OK. Listen, I've got to tell 
                         you, I had a lot of fun last night, 
                         really, but for me, where I'm at 
                         right now in my life, a relationship 
                         is...

                                     WOMAN
                         Chad; hold it. This was a one-time 
                         deal. You know it, I know it. There 
                         is no need for melodrama.

                                     PALOMINO
                         I just thought you might...

                                     WOMAN
                         Look, all I ask is that you don't 
                         mention this to anyone.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, that's not my style.

                                     WOMAN
                         Good.

                                     PALOMINO
                         So, I'll see you on the set.

               Palomino slips out the door. The woman falls back onto the 
               bed, turning her face toward the camera. We see it is NICOLE.

                                     NICOLE
                         God damn it.

               She lies for a moment, listening to the sound of the shower. 
               The bedside clock reads 4:30 A.M.

               INT. CAR. DAWN

               The car pulls up outside a NYC apt building. Jeff, Nick, and 
               Palomino sit inside.

                                     PALOMINO
                         I got two films coming up right after 
                         yours, Nick. One I play a rapist 
                         that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love 
                         with. The other I'm kind of a sexy 
                         serial killer who shacks up with 
                         Winona Ryder.

                                     NICK
                         That's great, man.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Yeah, but I'm not into that hostess 
                         twinkie shit, Nick.

                                     NICK
                         Hostess twinkie?

                                     PALOMINO
                         That Hollywood shit. It's all fluff, 
                         man. These are the kind of movies I 
                         want to do, right here.

                                     NICK
                         I'm glad you feel that way, Chad. 
                         And I just want to tell you, I'm 
                         really happy we can work together.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, me too! You're a great director, 
                         man. Your films are wacked! And I'm 
                         gonna be watching you, buddy. Like a 
                         hawk. I want to learn from you, Nick. 
                         I'm gonna pick your brain.

                                     NICK
                         Good. Then you can pick my nose.

                                     PALOMINO
                              (big laugh)
                         See what I mean? You're wacked. Hey, 
                         what are we sitting here for?

                                     NICK
                         We're waiting for Nicole.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Nicole? She's takin' a tax --
                              (he stops)

                                     NICK
                         What?

                                     PALOMINO
                         Probably taking a shower or something. 
                         Hey, how was her shower scene in 
                         that Richard Gere movie?

                                     NICK
                         Good.

                                     JEFF
                         Really great.

               The three men sit in silence. WS, showing the car parked 
               outside Nicole's apt, the men inside waiting.

               INT. THE SET. MORNING

               A small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the 
               middle of the huge empty space. One wall has a fake window. 
               The GAFFER lies on the bed staring absently at the AC sitting 
               motionless beside the camera a few feet away. Neither speaks 
               for a long moment.

                                     GAFFER
                         I think we got nudity today.

                                     AC
                              (reads from his 
                              callsheet)
                         It just says "Scene Six: Ellen and 
                         Damian kiss."

                                     GAFFER
                         Could be a kiss with nudity.

                                     AC
                         I like Ellen. She's my type.

                                     GAFFER
                         Why is that?

                                     AC
                         She's pretty. Smart. Kind of kooky.

                                     GAFFER
                         Maybe I'll give her a part. That's 
                         right; I'm makin' my own movie pretty 
                         soon.

                                     AC
                         Oh yeah?

                                     GAFFER
                         Yup. Feature. I brought my script.

               The Gaffer tugs a thin, tattered SCRIPT, folded lengthwise, 
               out of his back pocket.

                                     GAFFER
                         Palomino's perfect for the lead. I'm 
                         going to give it to him right during 
                         lunch. Maybe right after.

                                     AC
                         Alright.

                                     GAFFER
                         Got to be aggressive. You want to 
                         shoot it?

                                     AC
                         Sure.

                                     GAFFER
                         You ever shot anything?

                                     AC
                         No.

                                     GAFFER
                         That's alright; got to start 
                         somewhere.

               Suddenly the Gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the AC's 
               hand.

               INT. MAKEUP CORNER. DAY

               Nicole sits before the makeup mirror. LORDE, the male Makeup 
               artist picks up a tube of Preparation H and begins applying 
               it under Nicole's eyes just as Nick walks up.

                                     NICK
                         Jesus, what are you doing?

                                     LORDE
                         Shrinking tissue. That's what this 
                         stuff is for. Let that sit for two 
                         minutes, pumpkin; I'll be right back.

                                     NICK
                         How'd you get here?

                                     NICOLE
                         Took a taxi.

                                     NICK
                         Oh. We've been waiting in front of 
                         your apartment for half an hour.

                                     NICOLE
                         God, I'm sorry, Nick. Something came 
                         up. I forgot to call. I'm sorry, I 
                         feel like such an asshole.

                                     NICK
                         You're just saying that because you 
                         have Preparation H on your face.

                                     NICOLE
                         I never should have gone out last 
                         night. I hate jazz. God, I look 
                         terrible.

                         No you don't.

                         Don't bullshit me, Nick.

                                     NICK
                         I'm not. You really look beautiful.

               Something in Nick's voice makes Nicole glance up at him. He 
               looks away quickly. The moment is awkward, as if they both 
               realize he has inadvertently revealed something. Just then 
               Palomino approaches.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey! How'd you get here, Nicole?

                                     NICOLE
                         I took a cab.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Oh, cause we were wondering how you 
                         got here.

               Nick looks at both of them in a moment of silence.

                                     NICK
                         Alright, good; everybody's here. 
                         We'll do a run-through as soon as 
                         you guys are ready.

                                     PALOMINO
                         You got it, Chief.

               Lorde reenters as Nick leaves. Palomino sits in the chair 
               beside Nicole and Lorde immediately begins his makeup. No 
               one speaks.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               The crew is assembled behind the camera. Wolf is now wearing 
               a black eyepatch over one eye. Nick is on the set, talking 
               with Nicole and Palomino. Palomino wears a tuxedo and Nicole 
               is in an elaborate low-cut gown.

                                     WANDA
                         Hold it down, hold it down, people. 
                         Actors working.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Great shirt, Wanda.

                              (big smile)
                         Why, thank you, Chad.

                         OK, let's work out the rest of this 
                         blocking. Wolf --

                              eyepatch)
                         What happened to your eye?

                                     WOLF
                         A little accident.

                                     NICK
                         You going to be alright?

                                     WOLF
                         I think so.

                                     PALOMINO
                         It looks good on you, man.

                         Nicole is standing here, Chad, you're 
                         there by the chair. Camera is close 
                         on Ellen: her first line.

                         Good! "Professional," that's the 
                         cue; Damian steps up to the bed. 
                         Camera pulls back. The scene 
                         continues.

                                     NICOLE
                         Well, then: loved. How does that

                         It sounds like the champagne talking.

                         I've got a thought. What about Damian 
                         having an eyepatch like Wolf's?

               INT. THE SET. TAKE ONE

               Instantly the film cuts from color to B/W. Chad and Nicole 
               begin their Love Scene.

                                     NICOLE

                         Admired? That sounds rather 
                         professional.

               The camera starts to dolly, however Chad does not move. He 
               goes out of frame forcing Wolf to pan abruptly to Nicole.

                                     NICOLE
                         Well, then: loved. How does that

                         It sounds like the champagne talking.

                              (finally moves to his 
                              mark)
                         Why didn't you tell me?

                         God. And all this time I thought...

               Palomino and Nicole embrace. Their kiss, like the entire 
               scene, is flat, lifeless, and awful.

                         Not for camera. Chad was completely 
                         out of frame.

                         felt like something Damian would do; 
                         holding back to the last moment.

               and causing the camera crew and Nicole considerable confusion.

                         sound?

                                     PALOMINO
                         It sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     NICOLE
                         I've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Why didn't you tell me?

                                     NICOLE
                         We were working together. I didn't 
                         want anything to interfere.

                                     PALOMINO
                         God. And all this time I thought...

               The scene once again is awful. Nick gives their listless 
               kiss a few moments then calls CUT.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

                                     NICK
                         And, cut. Very good. Wolf?

                                     WOLF
                         Chad missed his cue again; the whole 
                         dolly is unusable.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, Chad. What happened; I thought 
                         you were going to hold back till 
                         "me"?

                                     PALOMINO
                         The more I thought about it the more 
                         it didn't seem right. And I'm 
                         thinking, watch me here, instead of 
                         coming around the bed, what if I 
                         just slip here like this and do the 
                         whole scene lying down?

                                     NICK
                         I don't know, that seems a little...

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, I'm just throwing out ideas 
                         here. Trying to get the juices 
                         flowing.

                                     NICK
                         Nicole, how does that feel to you?

                                     NICOLE
                         Well, I can turn to look at him. But 
                         won't you be shooting the back of my 
                         head?

                                     WOLF
                         Plus Chad is completely out of the 
                         light down there.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, Wolf; I'm not worried about my 
                         face, man. It's about the acting; 
                         that's all I care about.

                                     WOLF
                         It's your call, Nick. His acting or 
                         his face.

                                     NICK
                         For some reason I was hoping we could 
                         get both.
                              (laughs)
                         I thought that's what we were trying 
                         to do here.

                                     WOLF
                         I'll have to set another light.

                                     WANDA
                         We're ahead of schedule, Nick. I 
                         think we can afford a few minutes to 
                         set a light for Mr. Palomino.

                                     NICK
                         Good, let's do it. Ellen, Damian; 
                         let's talk for a second.

               As Nick, Nicole, and Palomino step off the set Wanda speaks 
               to the crew in general.

                                     WANDA
                         We'll pause to set this light and go 
                         again right away. How long, Wolf?

               Wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, 
               watching the Gaffer set up a light.

                                     WANDA
                         Wolf?

               Wolf walks away from Wanda without a word. The entire crew 
               watches this.

               INT. A CORNER. DAY

               Nick, Palomino, and Nicole confer, all three smoking.

                                     NICK
                         OK, let's make sure we know what's 
                         going on here. These two people have 
                         loved each other for years, each of 
                         them not knowing the other was in 
                         love with them. And tonight, in this 
                         little room it all comes out. It's 
                         like a dam bursting. Does that make 
                         sense? Nicole?

                                     NICOLE
                         It makes perfect sense. I just haven't 
                         found it yet. I'll get it though.

                                     NICK
                         What about you, Chad?

                                     PALOMINO
                         I'm there, man. I got the dam going, 
                         the river, everything. You watch, 
                         that little change in the blocking 
                         is going to open the whole scene up 
                         for me.

                         I've always admired you from afar.

               Palomino saunters over and sprawls on the bed, forcing Nicole 
               to turn her head completely away from the camera.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Admired? That sounds rather 
                         professional.

                                     NICOLE
                         Well, then: loved. How does that 
                         sound?

                                     PALOMINO
                         It sounds like the champagne talking.

                         Why didn't you tell me?

                                     NICOLE
                         We were working together -- I'm sorry, 
                         can we cut, Nick?

                         I know, I'm sorry. But this feels 
                         really awkward; turning all the way 
                         around like this.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, I think the lying on the bed 
                         is not quite working, Chad. Let's 
                         try one with the original blocking.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Which one was that? There's been so 
                         many damn changes. Could somebody 
                         help me out please?

                                     SCRIPT
                         The cue for the original blocking is 
                         "professional."

                                     PALOMINO
                              (intimate)
                         Thank you. Thank you very much.

                                     NICK
                         OK, right away. Call it, Wanda.

                                     NICOLE
                         Nick? Could I just have a moment? Is 
                         that alright?

                                     NICK
                         Of course, Nicole; are you kidding? 
                         Hold the roll, Wanda.

                                     WANDA
                         Holding the roll!

               Nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and 
               closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion 
               for the scene. Everyone watches her in complete silence.

               INT. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY

               Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the 
               Scriptgirl are standing side by side. As he leans between 
               them, checking his lines on the Scriptgirl's script, he 
               inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.

                                     PALOMINO
                              (whispers)
                         Someone over here smells very, very 
                         nice.

               Thinking he means her, Wanda's lips flutter in a brief, 
               involuntary smile. Meanwhile, the Scriptgirl turns away, 
               blushing furiously.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. Nicole raises her 
               head and nods once to Nick. She seems to have aroused some 
               real emotion in herself.

                         Damian up close and her "afar?" You 
                         start on a Close-up of Damian, watch 
                         me here; as she declares her love, 
                         the camera moves with me into this 
                         primo two-shot that you and the 
                         Wolfmeister have set up here.

                                     WOLF
                         I'd have to relight.

               Nick pauses, thinking hard.

                                     WANDA
                         We're still ahead of schedule, Nick; 
                         if that means anything to you.

                                     NICK
                         Let's do it.

                                     WOLF
                              (to the Gaffer)
                         Get me a tweenie right here, with 
                         diffusion.

                                     WANDA
                         OK, everyone stand by. We're pausing 
                         briefly to set one little light, 
                         then we're going again, right away. 
                         Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino.

                                     GAFFER
                         I'll do it.

                                     WOLF
                         Get the fucking light!

               INT. CRAFT SERVICE TABLE. DAY

               Several members of the crew loiter around the table. The 
               Scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup 
               of coffee in the other. Palomino notices her and moves quietly 
               to her side. Without a word he picks up the milk and pours 
               some in her coffee. Nicole stands nearby and watches the 
               following exchange.

                                     SCRIPT
                         Thanks.

                                     PALOMINO
                         My pleasure. Sugar?

                                     SCRIPT
                         Just a bit.

               Palomino puts sugar in her coffee with extreme care.

                                     PALOMINO
                         You like jazz?

                                     SCRIPT
                         Very much.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Maybe we could go hear some tonight.

               Palomino smiles and moves away just as Wanda comes up for a 
               coffee refill.

                                     WANDA
                         It's going well I think. Don't you 
                         think?

                                     SCRIPT
                         Very well. What time do you think 
                         we'll finish?

                                     WANDA
                         Early I hope. I'm going to a jazz 
                         club tonight.

                                     SCRIPT
                         Really? So am I. He's wonderful, 
                         isn't he?

                                     WANDA
                         Chad?

                                     SCRIPT
                         He's so natural, like... air.

               Nicole approaches.

                                     SCRIPT
                         I wonder what his sign is. Do you 
                         know, Nicole?

                                     NICOLE
                         I don't know his sign, but I think 
                         his moon is in Uranus.

               Wanda chokes hard on her coffee as Nicole walks off with a 
               bitter smile.

                                     SCRIPT
                         You don't have to be nasty.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Palomino saunters onto the set as Wolf and his crew finish 
               relighting.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Yo, Wolfman. Is this my new mark?

                                     WOLF
                         Until you change it. Where's my 
                         fucking eyepatch?!

               Wolf walks off. The Gaffer slips the AC a shrewd wink then 
               walks over and stands next to Palomino, giving him a big, 
               friendly grin.

                                     GAFFER
                         Hey, Chad.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, whatya say.

                                     GAFFER
                         I'm Bob. I'm lighting this show.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Chad Palomino; Actor.

                                     GAFFER
                              (big smile)
                         I know.

                                     PALOMINO
                              (to the ac)
                         Hey, what's your name?

                                     AC
                         Maurice.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Maurice! Hey, Maurice Chevalier! Any 
                         relation? Probably not. Hey, smoking 
                         crew guys, really.

               The Gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and 
               begins leafing through it.

                                     GAFFER
                         Hey thanks, Chad. Actually I wrote a 
                         script.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Oh, yeah?

               Palomino takes the Gaffer's script and holds it up to his 
               eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the 
               room. He points to the light.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, Bill. See that light over there?

                                     GAFFER
                         Uh, yeah.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Lower it about three feet.

               Palomino hands the Gaffer back his script and walks off. The 
               Gaffer and AC stand in silence for a long awkward moment.

               INT. BATHROOM. DAY

               Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. Leaning 
               closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair 
               falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.

                                     NICK
                         Would you care to have a drink 
                         tonight? Hey, Nicole, what do you 
                         say you and I have a drink tonight?

               Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, Nick! I'm sorry!

                                     NICK
                         That's OK, no problem. I'm just 
                         slapping a little water on my face.

               The two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. Nick looks 
               like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.

                                     NICK
                         So, it's going pretty good, huh?

                                     NICOLE
                         Is it? Something feels off.

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, you seem a little tense.

                                     NICOLE
                         Do I?

                                     NICK
                         But don't worry about it. Just take 
                         your attention off yourself and put 
                         it on Chad. Work off him a little 
                         more.

                                     NICOLE
                         OK, I'll try that.

                                     NICK
                         And listen, I know he's no Olivier. 
                         But he's got something, don't you 
                         think? Kind of a natural presence.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh yes, he's very natural.

               Nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the 
               question.

                                     NICK
                         So Nicole... anything else I can 
                         help you with?

                                     NICOLE
                         Actually there is. Could you maybe 
                         ask him to brush his teeth?

                                     NICK
                         Oh, sure.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Wanda crosses the set and assumes her position beside the 
               camera. Wolf sits behind it, barely a foot away.

                                     WOLF
                         My eye is killing me.

                                     WANDA
                         Put your eyepatch on.

                                     WOLF
                         I lost it.

                                     WANDA
                         Is that little light set yet?

                                     WOLF
                         That little light was set ten minutes 
                         ago.

                                     WANDA
                              (into her walkie)
                         Get me the A Team in here right away. 
                         Nick, Nicole, and Mr. Palomino.
                              (to Wolf)
                         Why didn't you tell me?

                                     WOLF
                         Hey, you're not worried about the 
                         time, I'm not worried about the time.

                                     WANDA
                         Oh, I am very worried about the time!

                                     WOLF
                         I know you are.

                                     WANDA
                         What is that supposed to mean?

                                     WOLF
                         What do you think it means?!

                                     WANDA
                         I don't know what it means!

                                     WOLF
                         Oh yes you do, you know exactly what 
                         it means.

                                     WANDA
                         I have no idea what you're talking 
                         about! Why are you --

                                     WOLF
                         You don't understand me, Wanda! You 
                         have no idea --

                                     WANDA
                         I don't understand you?!! All I do 
                         is take care of you!!!

               Nick suddenly runs up just as Wolf and Wanda are on the verge 
               of blows.

                                     NICK
                         Hey, hey, hey! What the hell's going 
                         on here?! Jesus, Wanda. This is a 
                         very intimate scene and a lot of 
                         tension on the set doesn't help. OK? 
                         Now, Wolf, let's just go through the 
                         first part of the move. Damian, on 
                         your new mark. Good. Close-up, Damian; 
                         Ellen in the background.

               Nick suddenly sees Palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.

                                     NICK
                         Chad, what are you doing?

                                     WOLF
                         Hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Wolf, could I borrow it? Cause I'm 
                         telling you, Nick; it really feels 
                         right. I feel like this guy now, 
                         man.

                                     NICK
                         I don't know, Chad. I don't think it 
                         works.

                                     PALOMINO
                         You're wrong, man. I'm going to fight 
                         you on this one.

                                     WOLF
                         Hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and I 
                         don't want anyone wearing it. It's 
                         insanitary.

               Palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to Wolf.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Fine. I'll get my own. Nick, send 
                         someone out for an eyepatch. I'll 
                         fucking pay for it myself.

               Nick pulls Palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.

                                     NICK
                         Listen, Chad. I didn't want to say 
                         this in front of Wolf but it makes 
                         you look a little... gay.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Really?

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, a little bit.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Jesus.

               Palomino sneaks a glance back at Wolf then whispers to Nick.

                                     PALOMINO
                         You're right. Thanks, buddy. Good 
                         call.

                                     WANDA
                         Are you ready, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         One second. You need a rehearsal, 
                         Wolf?

                                     WOLF
                         Let's just fucking shoot it!!

                                     PALOMINO
                         El Lobo!

               Palomino winks at Nick and walks back to his new mark, making 
               a barely audible howling sound behind his hand.

                                     NICK
                         Call it, Wanda.

                         And, action.

               INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FOUR

               The scene begins again. Palomino milks his Close-up for all 
               it's worth.

                                     NICOLE
                         I've always admired you from afar.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Admired? That sounds rather 
                         professional.

                                     NICOLE
                         Well, then: loved. How does that 
                         sound?

               Right on his cue, Palomino walks to the bed. As the camera 
               moves into the 2-shot he begins stroking Nicole's hair with 
               extreme care and concentration.

                                     PALOMINO
                         It sounds like the champagne talking.

                                     NICOLE
                         I've loved you from the moment we 
                         met.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Why didn't you tell me?

                                     NICOLE
                         We were working together. I didn't 
                         want anything to interfere -- God!

               Under the onslaught of escalating hair-stroking, Nicole 
               suddenly jerks her head away hard. Palomino jumps up and 
               begins pacing at the rear of the set.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

                                     NICK
                         Cut!

                                     WANDA
                         That's a cut. Hold the work, going 
                         again, right away.

                                     NICOLE
                         I'm sorry, Nick. I don't know why I 
                         did that. I'm sorry.

               Palomino suddenly stops pacing and addresses Nick with a 
               curtness that is a little startling.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Nick, could I talk to you a second?

               Palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head 
               indicating his wish for Nick to follow him.

                                     WANDA
                         A momentary delay. Everyone stand 
                         by. We're going again, right away.

                                     SOUND
                         Excuse me, Ellen? You were a tad low 
                         on that take.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, OK. I'll bring it up. Actually 
                         could I listen to the take before?

               The Sound man gives Nicole his headphones and rewinds the 
               tape recorder for her. The first several lines of the last 
               take are heard through the headphones.

               INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

               Nick follows Palomino behind the set, stopping just beside 
               the fake set window. Palomino whirls on Nick and whispers 
               fiercely.

                                     PALOMINO
                         I'm out of here, man!

                                     NICK
                         What's the matter?!

                                     PALOMINO
                         I like you, but I made a big mistake 
                         taking this part. Have someone call 
                         me a cab.

                                     NICK
                         Wait a second, Chad. Just talk to 
                         me. What's going on!?

                                     PALOMINO
                         I can't act with this woman. I know 
                         she's a friend of yours but I got to 
                         tell you: she cannot act worth a 
                         shit! I'm giving her everything! The 
                         whole thing I just did with the hair; 
                         did you see that? I came up with 
                         that on my own because I thought it 
                         would help her. But no, she's giving 
                         me nothing! I'm out of here.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Nicole listens to the last line of the previous take.

                                     PALOMINO
                         God, and all this time I thought...
                              (the muted rustle of 
                              the kiss)

               The Sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, 
               sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword 
               puzzle. Nicole is just about to take off the headphones when 
               she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking quite 
               clearly. Glancing up, she sees the Boom man has left his 
               boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the 
               open set window.

                                     PALOMINO (V.O.)
                         Why did you cast her? She sucked in 
                         that Richard Gere movie!

                                     NICK (V.O.)
                         You're right. She is not the best 
                         actress in the world. I see that now 
                         but you've got to help me, Chad. I'm 
                         asking you to please help me here. 
                         We've got to get through this somehow.

               The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicole's astonished 
               face. This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to the 
               microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ECU of the 
               mike.

               INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

               Camera is close on Nick and Palomino.

                                     PALOMINO
                         I'll tell you what this is about, 
                         man. You know why she took a cab 
                         this morning?

                                     NICK
                         Something came up.

                                     PALOMINO
                         No. She was in my hotel room and she 
                         didn't want you to know it. OK? I'm 
                         sorry it had to come out like this 
                         but I told her this morning "thanks 
                         a lot, it was a lot of fun last night 
                         but let's get something straight -- 
                         it was just a one-time deal," and 
                         she didn't want to hear that. She 
                         wanted more, you see what I'm saying? 
                         It's rejection.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. 
               She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach her 
               from behind the set.

                                     NICK
                         Nicole, listen...

                                     NICOLE
                         Nick, it's my fault the scene isn't 
                         working. I apologize. Chad, I 
                         apologize to you too. I'm completely 
                         unfocused here and I think you're 
                         absolutely right; what we need to do 
                         is loosen the scene up somehow.

               Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment.

                                     NICK
                         What would you like to do?

                                     NICOLE
                         I was wondering if we could try 
                         improvising the scene. More along 
                         the lines of what Chad has been doing. 
                         Maybe that would help me find 
                         something.

               Nick's smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-induced.

                                     NICK
                         That's a fantastic idea. What do you 
                         think, Chad?

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, that's the only way I can work. 
                         Let's take it apart, let's cut loose.

                                     NICK
                         Good! And we'll shoot it! Hell, why 
                         not?!

                                     PALOMINO
                         Roll that motherfucking camera,

                         Kiss my ass!

               Although Wolf says this quite loud, Palomino doesn't hear 
               him because he suddenly yells:

                                     PALOMINO
                         Yeah! Let's go!

               INT. THE SCENE. TAKE FIVE. THE IMPROV

               Nicole stays seated, though Palomino moves around making a 
               great show of loosening up.

                                     NICOLE

                         Have you? That's, wow; that's 
                         incredible. But that sounds kind of 
                         professional doesn't it? Admired?

                                     NICOLE
                         You're right. How does despised sound?

                                     PALOMINO
                         Great!
                              (laughs)
                         What's it mean?

                                     NICOLE
                              (laughs)
                         It's sort of like I think you're a 
                         piece of shit.

               Palomino is somewhat startled by this. He looks to Nick in 
               confusion. Nick silently encourages him to keep going.

                                     PALOMINO
                              (another laugh)
                         That sounds like the champagne 
                         talking.

                                     NICOLE
                         It's not. I really do think you are 
                         a piece of shit.

                                     PALOMINO
                         No, you don't. You love me.

                                     NICOLE
                         The fuck I do. I can't stand looking 
                         at you!

                                     PALOMINO
                         Then I guess I have nothing else to 
                         say.

                                     NICOLE
                         No, I think you have a lot more to 
                         say, Damian.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Well, I am surprised you feel this 
                         way, Ellen. I always thought you 
                         admired --

                                     NICOLE
                         That's not what I meant. You should 
                         tell everyone what you just told 
                         Nick behind the set.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Hey, this isn't part of the scene.

                                     NICOLE
                         Say it anyway: The reason this scene 
                         isn't working is because you and I 
                         slept together last night. Did 
                         everyone hear that?! I fucked Chad 
                         last night!

               Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned amazement.

                                     PALOMINO
                         See, Nick! I told you this was about 
                         rejection!

                                     NICOLE
                         You fucking scumbag! You think I 
                         give a rat's ass about you?! I was 
                         there to get laid and even that was 
                         a joke!

                                     PALOMINO
                         You know, you are really starting to 
                         piss me off!

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, does that mean you're not going 
                         to come wiggle on the bed anymore, 
                         or stroke my hair real soft and 
                         concerned, or kiss me like a soap 
                         opera acting piece of shit!

               Palomino snaps, and lunges for Nicole. She leaps to the other 
               side of the bed.

                                     NICOLE
                         Come on! I'll kick your ass! Come 
                         on!

               Nick steps between Nicole and Palomino.

                                     NICK
                         OK, guys, I think we can stop there.

                                     PALOMINO
                         You bet your ass we can stop! Wanda, 
                         call me a cab!

                                     NICK
                         Hold on, Chad. Let's just try to 
                         calm down.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Fuck you. I'm out of here, man. This 
                         movie is bullshit.

                                     NICK
                         Now wait a second, Chad. There's no 
                         reason for hostility.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Shut up, you fucking loser. The only 
                         reason I took this part was because 
                         someone said you knew Quentin 
                         Tarantino! You're nowhere, man.

                                     NICK
                         Hey, you want to go? Go! I'm sick of 
                         your shit, you hostess twinkie 
                         motherfucker!

                                     PALOMINO
                         What'd you call me?

                                     NICK
                         You heard me.

                                     PALOMINO
                         Say it again.

                                     NICK
                         You hostess twinkie motherfucker!

               Palomino suddenly punches Nick in the stomach, leaving him 
               bent over and gasping for breath. Nicole instantly leaps on 
               Palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of 
               his head. Palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as 
               Wanda rushes forward.

                                     WANDA
                         Alright, everyone just stop. Stop! 
                         Stop this right now!

               As she tries to separate Nicole and Palomino, Palomino shoves 
               her hard, knocking her down. Instantly Wolf leaps off the 
               camera and runs up to Palomino.

                                     WOLF
                         Alright, you've asked for it, Chad!

               Palomino suddenly punches Wolf in the teeth, dropping him 
               like a stone.

                                     WANDA
                              (shrieks)
                         Wolf!

               Suddenly Nick staggers to his feet and rushes at Palomino. 
               His momentum knocks all three backwards onto the bed, 
               Palomino's head cracking Nicole in the teeth.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, God!

               Nicole rolls free as Nick and Palomino wrestle on the bed. 
               Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts pounding 
               his head against the mattress.

                                     NICK
                         You want to pick my brain?! This is 
                         the way I direct hostess twinkie 
                         scumbags like you!

               As Nick continues to pound Palomino's head the Gaffer notices 
               Palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of 
               Nick's forearm around his neck. He and the Boom man rush 
               forward and finally manage to pry Palomino free.

                                     NICK
                         Get him out of here! Someone take 
                         him back to his hotel!

               As the Gaffer and Boom man drag off the almost unconscious 
               Palomino, the Scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.

                                     SCRIPT
                              (sniffling)
                         Chad...

               Suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for Nick's labored 
               breathing and the Scriptgirl's sniffles. Nick leans over and 
               touches Nicole's shoulder.

                                     NICK
                         Are you alright?

                                     NICOLE
                         Don't touch me.

               EXT. DAY. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE SET

               The Gaffer and AC help the still-groggy Palomino into the 
               back of the production van. JEFF, the driver, watches them 
               in sleepy curiosity.

               With Palomino safely propped in a seat, the AC goes back to 
               the set. The Gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out 
               of his back pocket and slaps it into Palomino's motionless 
               hand.

                                     GAFFER
                         It's called "Tsunami." A Japanese 
                         tidal wave hits New York. You've an 
                         ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman, working 
                         undercover. You save the city. You'd 
                         be perfect for the lead. That's my 
                         number; call me, or I'll call you. 
                         Either way it's been great working 
                         with you, man.

               As Palomino stares at him blankly, the Gaffer slams the door. 
               The car pulls out.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Nick and Nicole are sitting up on the bed, alone on the now 
               empty set.

                                     NICK
                         Nicole, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. 
                         You were great in that Richard Gere 
                         movie.

                                     NICOLE
                         Shut up. You're no different than he 
                         is. You lie, you're deceitful...

                                     NICK
                         I'm not lying. Christ, I tell everyone 
                         how great you are. I've got nothing 
                         but respect and admiration for you.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh God, now you're doing your own 
                         fucking script.

                                     NICK
                         Well, why do you think I wrote it?!

                                     NICOLE
                         I have no idea!

                                     NICK
                         It's about you. It's about how I 
                         feel about you.

                                     NICOLE
                         Christ, did you get a bump on your 
                         head, Nicky. 'Cause you're talking 
                         like an idiot.

                                     NICK
                         Nicole. I've loved you since the day 
                         we met.

               Nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.

                                     NICOLE
                         Why didn't you tell me?

                                     NICK
                         I didn't want anything to get in the 
                         way of us working together.

                                     NICOLE
                         God, and all this time I thought...

               Nick and Nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN

               Nicole snaps awake with a jolt. She glances quickly at the 
               clock which reads 4:35. The sound of the shower still running 
               in the bathroom.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, God.

               Nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. As the 
               camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right 
               against the lens, turning the image to total BLACKNESS.

               The frame is BLACK. The recognizable clatter and clunk of 
               the FILM CREW is heard. Wanda's voice is prominent.

                                     WANDA
                         Don't go out that door!

               Suddenly a DOOR opens away from camera and the AC stops, a 
               foot away from the lens. Behind him, Wanda and the rest of 
               the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. 
               We see now the door and the plywood walls around it are FAKE.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

                                     AC
                         Why not?

                                     WANDA
                         It's part of the set, goddamnit. Now 
                         go around.

                                     AC
                         Next time. This is an emergency.

               The AC rushes past and a moment later the camera DOLLIES 
               slowly through the fake door toward Wanda pacing near the 
               set camera.

                                     WANDA
                              (into her walkie)
                         Has Ellen showed up yet?

                                     WALKIE
                         ssss... kkkkkrrk.

                                     WANDA
                         Get her into wardrobe right away.

                                     WALKIE
                         ssskk... ssssrrrk?

                                     WANDA
                         No! Scene six; Scene five has been 
                         postponed. I'm not going to say it 
                         again; Mr. Palomino is not working 
                         today. Now where is that smoke 
                         machine!

               INT. SET BUILDING, HALLWAY. DAY

               The AC bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and 
               walks quickly toward the camera. Without knocking he pushes 
               open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.

                                     AC
                         Oh. Sorry.

               Standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off 
               the running faucet is, TITO a DWARF. He is dressed in a sky 
               blue tuxedo with tails. A top hat and white gloves rest on 
               the closed toilet seat. Tito appears extremely annoyed.

                                     TITO
                         What do you want?!

                                     AC
                         I need to use the bathroom. Kind of 
                         an emergency.

                                     TITO
                         Well, fucking knock!!

               Tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the 
               AC staring after him in astonishment.

                                     TITO
                              (muttering)
                         I swear to Christ, one of these days 
                         I'm going to punch somebody in the 
                         balls!

               INT. WARDROBE ROOM. DAY

               Camera is close on Nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin 
               white veil is placed on her head. Camera pulls back to reveal 
               SACHIKO, the Costume Designer putting the finishing touches 
               to Nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white 
               wedding gown. Nick stands nearby, smoking.

                                     NICK
                         Just as we pull up to your apartment 
                         Palomino suddenly says he feels so 
                         sick he can't work today.

                                     NICOLE
                         God. Was it something he ate?

                                     SACHIKO
                         Stand up, please.

                                     NICK
                         I don't know.

                                     NICOLE
                         Can he work tomorrow?

                                     SACHIKO
                         Turn around, please.

                                     NICK
                         Don't know that either. But I'm not 
                         worrying about it. I had this dream 
                         last night where I was on the set. 
                         You were in it, and another woman, 
                         someone older. Anyway, everything 
                         was going wrong. The harder I tried 
                         to hold things together the more 
                         they fell apart. And you know what 
                         that dream was telling me, Nicole? 
                         You just got to roll with it. And 
                         that's what I'm doing, I'm rolling 
                         with it. So, we'll just shoot the 
                         Dream Sequence today.

               Just then Tito walks in.

                                     NICK
                         Hey, Tito. You look great, man.

                                     TITO
                         I feel like shit.

                                     NICK
                         No, you look good. Thanks for coming 
                         in on such short notice. This is 
                         Nicole; she's playing Ellen.

                                     NICOLE
                         Hello. Toto, is it?

                                     TITO
                         Tito.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, I'm sorry.

                                     NICK
                         Listen, if there's anything I can do 
                         to make you... if you need... uh, 
                         just let me know.

                                     TITO
                         Put a stool in the bathroom.

               Tito walks out, followed immediately by Sachiko, leaving 
               Nicole alone with Nick.

                                     NICK
                         Did I just offend him?

                                     NICOLE
                         What did you say?

                                     NICK
                         "Short notice?"

                                     NICOLE
                         Come on; that was nothing. I'm the 
                         one who called him "Toto." Jesus, 
                         I'm out of it. I dreamt I was on the 
                         set last night too.

                                     NICK
                         Oh yeah?

                                     NICOLE
                         Yeah. You were in the dream.

                                     NICK
                         Was I freaking out?

                                     NICOLE
                         Actually, you were.

                                     NICK
                         That's great: I freak out in my dream; 
                         I freak out in your dream. No wonder 
                         I'm fucking exhausted.

                                     NICOLE
                         Nick...

                                     NICK
                         Yeah?

               Nicole stares at Nick for a long moment then smiles briefly 
               and turns away.

               INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY

               A dented, ancient smoke machine squats forlornly in the middle 
               of the set. WOLF (with eyepatch), the GAFFER, AC, BOOM MAN, 
               and the SOUND MAN stand around it, scrutinizing it intently. 
               Wolf seems in an unusually good mood.

                                     WOLF
                         Alright, guys; special effects today. 
                         Could be fun. Who knows how to work 
                         this baby?

                                     GAFFER
                         It's the old T-160. I used it once 
                         in '85.

                                     AC
                         Damn. '85.

                                     WOLF
                         What's this?

                                     GAFFER
                         That's where the gas goes.

                                     BOOM
                         No, that's where the oil goes.

                                     GAFFER
                         Is it?

                                     BOOM
                         I think so.

                                     GAFFER
                         You're right. It's coming back now.

                                     WOLF
                         I'm going to let you handle this 
                         one, Bob. This is your baby. And 
                         Les, if he needs help you give him a 
                         hand. OK, guys? We're all working 
                         together today.

               Wolf walks off. The Gaffer kneels to inspect the smoke machine 
               closer.

                                     GAFFER
                         Yup, all coming back now. Like riding 
                         a bike. T-160, 1985. 1985, T-160.

                                     AC
                         Way to go, Bob.

               INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA

               Wanda stands alone by the camera, looking around at the 
               bustling crew like a battalion commander watching her troops 
               in battle. Nick approaches her.

                                     NICK
                         How are we doing, Wanda?

                                     WANDA
                         Not good, Nick. Not bad, but not 
                         good. We need to finish this scene 
                         and do Scene thirty-one today.

                                     NICK
                         Scene thirty-one?! I left my notes 
                         for Scene thirty-one at home! I didn't 
                         know we were --

                                     WANDA
                         Nick, Nick. I'll send someone to 
                         your apartment to pick them up. Now, 
                         relax.

                                     NICK
                         Oh, OK. Send somebody to my apartment 
                         to pick them up; it's the red 
                         notebook, under the bed.

                                     WANDA
                         It's taken care of, Nick.

                                     NICK
                         Good. Great. Good.

               Nick walks off quickly, muttering to himself. A moment later 
               Wolf strolls up to Wanda.

                                     WOLF
                         We're all lit, the smoke machine is 
                         under control; we're ready to go.

                                     WANDA
                              (hard)
                         What about the dolly?

                                     WOLF
                         Just need to see a run-through and 
                         we're all set. I'm going to make 
                         your job easy today, Wanda. Wandaful.
                              (he slips his arm 
                              around her)
                         Mmm, I'm glad you wore that perfume. 
                         And don't worry about Palomino; I'll 
                         take you to a jazz club tonight.

                                     WANDA
                         Oh, I can't make it. I have to go 
                         see Chad; he's extremely ill.

                                     WOLF
                         Oh, by the way my eye's much better.

                                     WANDA
                         Listen, Wolf, this may not be the 
                         best time to say this but our 
                         relationship is going nowhere.

                                     WOLF
                         What do you mean?

                                     WANDA
                         Please, don't take it personally. 
                         Because I care for you, Wolf, I really 
                         do. But I've had this feeling for 
                         quite a while and I think it's time 
                         we ended it. OK?

                                     WOLF
                              (pause)
                         OK.

                                     WANDA
                         I think it's better.

                                     WOLF
                         So do I.

                                     WANDA
                         Well, good. Still friends?

                                     WOLF
                         Sure.

                                     WANDA
                         Great, cause we still have to work 
                         together and there's no reason it 
                         has to be unpleasant. Give me a hug.

               Wanda and Wolf move into an extremely wooden embrace.

                                     WANDA
                         You're a real special guy, Wolf.

                                     WOLF
                         Thanks.

               Wanda slips Wolf a tender smile then walks away.

                                     WANDA

                         OK, let's get the A Team in please! 
                         Nick, Ellen, Mr. Tito!

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               Nick is working with the crew and the actors. The set consists 
               of two flats (one with the fake door) joined to make a corner. 
               The flats are painted fire-engine red.

                                     NICK
                         OK, here's the shot. We start wide 
                         with Ellen standing absolutely still 
                         right in the middle of the frame. 
                         You got that, Wolf?

                                     WOLF
                         Yeah.

                                     NICK
                              (notices eyepatch)
                         What happened to your eye?

                                     WOLF
                         Nothing. It's a little sensitive 
                         today.

                                     NICK
                         Can you see?

                                     WOLF
                              (snaps)
                         Of course I can see!

               For a moment Nick looks like he might snap back at Wolf but 
               he draws a deep breath and continues.

                                     NICK
                         OK, Ellen is standing there. The 
                         smoke is flowing in and: Ellen's 
                         line.

                                     NICOLE
                         I am so hungry.

                                     NICK
                         Good, Tito, that's your cue.

               The fake door opens and Tito enters wearing his top hat and 
               carrying a golden apple in his gloved hands.

                                     NICK
                         You walk around her once, hold the 
                         apple out, that's right; just beyond 
                         her reach. You're staring at her 
                         hard. Harder, good. Then stop right 
                         here. Can we get a mark, please?

               The AC moves up to Nick and places a piece of yellow tape on 
               the floor. CU the yellow tape.

                                     NICK
                         Then we dolly in to Tito's Close-up. 
                         Alright, Wolf?

                                     WANDA
                         It should be hand-held.

                                     NICK
                         No, I think it's better on the dolly.

                                     WOLF
                         Whatever.

                                     NICOLE
                         Nick, do I see him?

                                     NICK
                         No, just the apple. And Tito, right 
                         after we dolly in give me a little 
                         laugh there.

                                     TITO
                         A little laugh?

                                     NICK
                         Big, little; anything you feel like 
                         doing. OK? Good. Let's shoot one. 
                         Call it, Wanda.

                                     WANDA
                         OK, here we go. Camera back to One. 
                         Action on the smoke.

               The Gaffer turns on the smoke machine which emits a pathetic 
               wisp of smoke that immediately dissipates.

                                     WANDA
                         And roll sound.

                                     NICK
                         Hold it, Wanda. Can we get a little 
                         more smoke? Is that possible?

                                     GAFFER
                         Oh, sure.

               The Gaffer adjusts a knob and another thin puff of smoke 
               wheezes out.

                                     NICK
                         Good. Call it, Wanda.

                                     WANDA
                         Going for picture. Lock it up. And 
                         roll sound.

               INT. THE DREAM. TAKE ONE. DAY

               Nicole stands motionless in the middle of the empty set. Her 
               white wedding gown stands out sharply against the deep red 
               walls. A sad shred of smoke drifts by her head.

                                     NICOLE
                         I am so hungry.

               Tito opens the door and walks in, staring hard at Nicole. 
               His sky-blue tuxedo gleams in the rich light. He walks around 
               her in a circle holding the golden apple just beyond her 
               reach. He stops on his mark and the camera dollies into a CU 
               of him. He doesn't laugh. Nick watches this for a moment in 
               intense concentration.

                                     WANDA
                         That's a cut. Nick; comments?

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, just a couple. I thought that 
                         was uh... good. Tito, that was very 
                         good, man, really. You didn't feel 
                         like laughing?

                                     TITO
                         I laughed.

                                     NICK
                         Oh, OK; I guess I missed it. You 
                         could make it bigger if you want. 
                         And Ellen, maybe just a little more 
                         tension when you see him.

                                     NICOLE
                         I thought I didn't see him.

                                     NICK
                         Right, maybe you see him a little 
                         bit.

                                     NICOLE
                         Alright, I'm confused. Do I see him 
                         or not?

                                     NICK
                         You see him.

                         OK, what is the tension? Who is Toto?

                                     TITO
                              (hard)
                         It's Tito.

                         Toto.

                                     NICOLE
                         Oh, God. I'm sorry, Tito. I don't 
                         know why I'm doing that. I'm really 
                         sorry.

                         Ellen, come on now; concentrate. 
                         Remember; you're marrying Damian 
                         tomorrow. You're a little anxious. 
                         You have this dream. Let's call it 
                         an Anxiety Dream, and Tito represents 
                         the anxiety.

               CU Tito looking none too happy about this representation.

                                     NICK
                         OK? It seems pretty simple.

                         some smoke on this one.

                         I still think it should be hand-held.

                         Yeah, well, I don't want it hand-
                         held. I want it on the dolly. Where's

                         feels fake to me.

               Nick's tone with Nicole suddenly takes on an almost 
               imperceptible edge, tinged with annoyance.

                         Oh, OK. A laugh. I'm thinking maybe 
                         like this. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

               Everyone watches Nick demonstrate the laugh. He seems unaware 
               he resembles a drunken, slightly annoyed idiot.

                         Something like that. OK? And remember, 
                         Tito, this is a dream. Not everything 
                         has to make sense. A laugh right 
                         there heightens our sense of... of...

                         Exactly. Wolf, how was that for you?

                                     WOLF
                         I still think it should be hand-held.

                         be! It's on the dolly so just forget 
                         about it!

               There is a strained moment of silence on the set as everyone 
               witnesses this rebuke.

                         Might as well get a couple hamsters 
                         in here blowing smoke rings for

                         it now. We're going to see some smoke 
                         now.

                         Alright.

               Nick follows Wolf off the set.

               INT. A CORNER. DAY

               As soon as Wolf and Nick reach the darkened corner, Wolf 
               whirls to face Nick.

                                     WOLF
                         I really don't like being spoken to 
                         like that, Nick!

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, well I don't like your attitude!

                                     WOLF
                         I don't have an attitude!

                                     NICK
                         The hell you don't! Every time I ask 
                         you to do something all I get is No, 
                         No, No and I'm sick of it! I hired 
                         you to do a job; if you're not going 
                         to do it you better let me know right 
                         now!

               Wolf is about to yell back at Nick when suddenly he stops 
               and lets out a deep, painful sigh.

                                     WOLF
                         I'm sorry, Nick. I'm going through 
                         some heavy shit.

                                     NICK
                         What do you mean?

                                     WOLF
                         I can't really go into it. It's pretty 
                         heavy.

                         Personal?

               Wolf makes a slight motion with his head toward Wanda who is 
               standing some distance away watching them. Seeing the two 
               men looking at her Wanda shoots them a hard glare which 
               prompts Wolf and Nick to turn away quickly.

                                     WOLF
                         Personal, professional, emotional. 
                         It's doing a number on me. And now 
                         you're telling me you're going to 
                         fire me.

                                     NICK
                         I didn't say that, Wolf. Come on, 
                         I'm not going to fire you. You're 
                         doing a great job here.

                                     WOLF
                         Am I?

                                     NICK
                         Yeah, I don't know what I'd do without 
                         you, man. You've got a great eye. I 
                         just hope it's not the one under 
                         that eyepatch.

               Nick lets out a tense, strained laugh but Wolf's only response 
               is to stare back at him sadly.

                                     NICK
                         Listen, Wolf. Let me tell you one 
                         thing I've learned; sometimes you 
                         just have to roll with things. You 
                         know?

                                     WOLF
                         You're right.

                                     NICK
                         Roll with it, man. You'll be OK.

               Wolf lets out another deep sigh.

                                     WOLF
                         Thanks, bro.

               INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY

               The Gaffer, Boom man, and AC kneel around the smoke machine. 
               A can of gas and a quart of oil stand beside them.

                                     BOOM
                         That's where the oil goes.

                         No, that's where the gas goes.

                         I'm tellin' you, Bob. That's where 
                         the oil goes.

                         Lester, don't you think Bob knows 
                         where the oil goes?!

                                     GAFFER
                         I don't remember using oil in '85.

                                     AC
                         Maybe both the oil and gas go in 
                         there?

               The Gaffer and Boom man turn and look at the AC for a long 
               moment.

                                     BOOM
                         I think he's right.

                         I think he is too. OK, three parts 
                         gas, one part oil.

               The Gaffer and Boom man pour liberal amounts of gas and oil 
               into the T-160.

               INT. THE DREAM. TAKE THREE

               Nicole stands motionless in her white wedding dress, looking 
               genuinely alarmed, possibly because of the huge clouds of 
               smoke now spewing out of the panting smoke machine.

                         I am so hungry.

               Tito enters, stares at her hard and walks around her in a 
               circle holding the apple just beyond her reach. The smoke is 
               so thick both of them are barely visible. Just as Tito gets 
               to his mark the smoke machine backfires with a tremendous 
               explosion and begins filling the room with dense, blinding 
               smoke.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               The smoke blanks out the entire frame. Frantic shouts are 
               heard from unseen bodies.

               The smoke machine emits a loud hiss and dies, filling the 
               room with sudden silence. Slowly the smoke begins to clear 
               as the crew moves around muttering and coughing.

                                     WANDA
                         Clear the set! Ellen! Tito! Please

                         step off the set!

               A pair of fuzzy-slippered feet enter the smoky frame. The 
               camera BOOMS up, passing over a woman's bare shins, a 
               flowered, blue silk housecoat until finally coming to rest 
               on the pleasantly smiling face of CORA. This is the same 
               woman who played Ellen's Mother in Part One; she is dressed 
               exactly the same as she was in their scene. The camera pulls 
               back to reveal JEFF the Intern standing nervously beside her 
               with a red notebook in his hands.

                                     CORA
                         Hi, Nicky.

               Nick gapes in utter astonishment.

               Wanda speaks urgently into the phone while Nicole stands 
               beside her. Jeff (still wearing his hat) waits at a distance 
               clutching Nick's red notebook.

                         blue slippers. How do I know? Because 
                         she's sitting ten feet away from me. 
                         Well sweetheart, that's going to be 
                         a real fucking problem.

               Nicole turns away and walks past Jeff to the Craft Service 
               table.

                                     JEFF
                         She was waiting outside Nick's 
                         apartment when I went to pick up his 
                         notebook. She said she was looking 
                         for him so I figured I should just 
                         bring her up here. You look really 
                         pretty in that dress.

               Nicole nods politely then looks to the Makeup corner where 
               Nick sits talking earnestly to his mother.

                         I took a bus in; went right to your 
                         apartment.

                         How did you get out of your room?

                                     CORA
                         Oh, I just went right through the 
                         door.

                                     NICK
                         It was unlocked!?

                                     CORA
                         No, it was locked. I just went through 
                         it. It's something I've learned to 
                         do, Nicky. I can walk through just 
                         about anything; like air.

                                     NICK
                         Mom, you've got to stop doing this. 
                         I'm serious. I'm a little upset with 
                         you. You could have gotten lost, or 
                         hurt.

                                     CORA
                         I wanted to see you. I've missed 
                         you.

                                     NICK
                         I know, Mom; I've missed you too. 
                         But it's not really a good time.

               Nicole approaches, holding up the hem of her wedding gown. 
               There is a subtle tension smoldering between her and Nick.

                                     NICOLE
                         They're sending a car. It should be 
                         here in a couple of hours. They didn't 
                         even know she was gone.

                                     NICK
                         Jesus, I don't believe this.

                                     CORA
                         I'm sorry, Nick. If I knew there was 
                         going to be a wedding I would have 
                         worn my fucking hat.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               The camera holds on Tito pacing slowly, alone on the set. He 
               is smoking fiercely, holding his top hat with one hand. 
               Suddenly he begins laughing in a loud, stage bellow.

               INT. A CORNER OF THE SET. DAY

               Nick sets a chair for his mother and helps her sit down. 
               Nicole joins Tito on the set and talks quietly to him.

                                     NICK
                         There. How's that, Mom? Can you see?

                                     CORA
                         Is the little fellow going to do 
                         gymnastics?

               Tito glances up at her quickly.

                                     NICK
                         Shhhh! No. Now come on, Mom. You've 
                         got to be quiet. Absolutely quiet. 
                         OK?

                                     CORA
                              (whispers)
                         OK.

               INT. THE SET. NEAR THE CAMERA. DAY

               Wanda and Wolf stand beside each other in tense, awkward 
               silence for a long moment.

                                     WANDA
                         How are you doing?

                                     WOLF
                         Good; real good.

               Wolf looks as if he's about to burst into tears as Nick walks 
               up.

                                     NICK
                         How's the smoke machine?

                                     WANDA
                         It's dead, Nick. I've got calls out 
                         to every Effects house in the city 
                         but I just can't seem to locate --

                                     NICK
                         Forget it. We'll shoot without it.

                                     WANDA
                         But Nick, it's a Dream Sequence.

                                     NICK
                         That's the way it goes, Wanda. We're 
                         just going to have to roll with it. 
                         Nothing else we can do. We've got to 
                         roll with it, right, Wolf?

               Wolf meets Nick's eyes and gives an extremely melancholy 
               nod. Nick turns to address Nicole and Tito and the edge 
               immediately slips back into his voice.

                                     NICK
                         OK, here we go. Ellen, you've got to 
                         keep reaching for that apple. I don't 
                         feel that you really want it. I mean, 
                         Christ, how many times do I have to 
                         tell you!

               Nicole glares at Nick for a moment then abruptly turns and 
               walks off the set. Nick stares after her in confusion then 
               quickly follows her.

                                     WANDA
                         Everyone stand by. Nobody move. Going 
                         again, right away.

               EXT. STREET. NYC. DAY

               Nicole stands with her back to the camera as Nick strides up 
               to her with impatience.

                                     NICK
                         Alright, Nicole. What's the matter?

                                     NICOLE
                         You tell me! You're the one with the

                         You've been picking on me all day! I 
                         can't do anything right!

                                     NICK
                         I'm sorry if I was short with you, 
                         Nicole, but I think you can see I'm 
                         under a little pressure here. I'm 
                         shooting a Dream Sequence without a 
                         smoke machine, my mother's out there 
                         thinking she's at a circus wedding 
                         and you tell me the whole movie seems 
                         fake!

                                     NICOLE
                         I never said that!

                         You did too. You said, "Everything 
                         feels fake."

                         I meant me! I feel fake! Everything 
                         I'm doing feels fake. I can't act. I 
                         should just do shower scenes in 
                         Richard Gere movies for the rest of 
                         my life!

                                     NICK
                         Nicole, that's ridiculous. You're a 
                         fantastic actress. All you have to 
                         do is show me you want that apple 
                         more than anything else in the world; 
                         don't give up. Understand? You cannot 
                         give up.

                         OK.

               Suddenly Wanda yells out.

                                     WANDA
                         Ready, Nick?!

               Nick rushes back onto the set.

                                     NICK
                         OK, here we go. Everybody focus, 
                         concentrate. And Tito, we're still 
                         looking for that little laugh, pal. 
                         OK? Call it, Wanda!

                                     WANDA
                         Picture's up. There will be no smoke 
                         in this scene. No smoke. No smoke in 
                         the Dream Sequence. And roll sound.

               INT. THE DREAM. TAKE FOUR. DAY

               Nicole stands motionless in her wedding gown.

                                     NICOLE
                         I am so hungry.

               Tito walks in, stares at her hard, then walks around her 
               once with the golden apple just beyond her outstretched hands. 
               He stops and the camera dollies into his CLOSE-UP. Nick 
               watches in hopeful expectation. He waits and waits but Tito 
               does not laugh.

               Just then the door in the rear set wall opens and Cora steps 
               in, looking oddly puzzled.

                                     CORA
                         Oh, I thought this was the TV room.

               Nick walks back on the set and addresses Nicole and Tito.

                         OK, good. Very good.

                         Tito, I think we're having a little 
                         communication problem here. All I 
                         want you to do is laugh. OK?

                         Why?

                                     NICK
                         I told you why.

                         Tell me again.

               INT. OFF THE SET. DAY

               Wolf (still wearing his eyepatch) walks over and sits quietly 
               in a chair beside Cora. He does not speak to her and gazes 
               blankly out at Nick, Tito, and Nicole on the set some distance 
               away. Cora however stares at the side of his head with such 
               intensity Wolf can't help but turn to her.

               Cora still doesn't take her eyes off him and in fact stares 
               even more intently into his eye.

               Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back. Cora continues 
               to stare at him. Suddenly, his eye is full of tears. Cora 
               watches in rapt silence. Wolf is crying openly now. Cora 
               reveals no hint of emotion as she reaches out and gently 
               lifts the eyepatch off of his eye. A tight smile of 
               satisfaction creases her lips as a tiny pool of tears is 
               released, streaming quickly down Wolf's cheek. No one sees 
               this.

               Nick paces tensely in front of Nicole and Tito.

                         Look, Tito. It's not that big a deal. 
                         It's a dream, alright. Strange things 
                         happen in a dream. All you have to 
                         do is laugh. Why is that such a

                         dwarf?

                                     NICK
                         He doesn't have to be a dwarf.

                                     TITO
                         Then why is he?! Is that the only 
                         way you can make this a dream; put a 
                         dwarf in it?

                                     NICK
                         No, Tito; that's not --

                                     TITO
                         Have you ever had a dream with a 
                         dwarf in it?! Do you know anyone 
                         who's had a dream with a dwarf in 
                         it? NO! I don't even have dreams 
                         with dwarves in them! The only place 
                         I've seen dwarves in dreams is in 
                         stupid movies like this! Make it 
                         weird; put a dwarf in it. Everyone 
                         will go "whoa whoa whoa, must be a 
                         dream, there's a fucking dwarf in 
                         it!" Well, I'm sick of it. You can 
                         take this Dream Sequence and shove 
                         it up your ass!

               Tito hurls his top hat and gloves to the floor and walks 
               out. Everyone stares at Nick who is frozen in stunned silence. 
               Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly.

                                     WANDA
                         Nick?
                              (no response)
                         I can get right on the phone. We'll 
                         try to get another... small person 
                         here as soon as possible.

                                     NICK
                         No. He's absolutely right.

               Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in silence. 
               Wolf appears behind him, still wiping his eyes.

                                     WOLF
                         You want to just shoot Ellen, Nick? 
                         She could be in the dream by herself.

                                     NICK
                         No. We're not going to shoot anything. 
                         I'm sorry. Thanks for all your help, 
                         but it's over. I can't take it 
                         anymore. I tried to roll with it but 
                         it's time to face the music; I can't 
                         do this. I am not a director. The 
                         shoot is over. I give up.

               Nick's speech has the simple eloquence of truth; he is not 
               bitter or self-pitying. He seems unaware of how disturbing 
               this is to the crew. They all stand around him in shock, 
               afraid to move or speak. Finally Wolf turns to the AC and 
               puts his hand on his shoulder, like a father to his young 
               son.

                                     WOLF
                         Take the camera off the dolly. Start 
                         putting it away.

               Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence. Nicole 
               stands alone on the set in her wedding dress, still holding 
               the golden apple. Her face is frozen in dismay. Suddenly 
               CORA comes through the set door and marches up to Nicole.

                                     CORA
                         Give me that apple!

               At the sound of his mother's voice, Nick looks up. He sees 
               her snatch the apple from Nicole's hand and march back out 
               the door, closing it behind her.

                                     CORA
                              (behind the door)
                         I'm ready, Nick!

               INT. BY THE CAMERA. DAY

               Nick gets up slowly and whispers intensely to Wanda, Wolf, 
               and the rest of the crew.

                                     NICK
                         Roll camera. Roll sound. Let's go. 
                         Right away.

               Wolf grabs the camera and puts it on his shoulder (hand-held) 
               as the rest of the crew moves quickly and silently into 
               position. On a terse signal from Nick the camera starts 
               rolling.

               INT. THE SET. THE DREAM. DAY

               Nicole takes the silent "action" cue from Nick.

                                     NICOLE
                         I am so hungry.

               Right on cue Cora walks through the door, holding the golden 
               apple out in front of her. She circles Nicole with 
               determination, seemingly oblivious to Nick and the rest of 
               the crew hovering behind Wolf as he begins following her 
               with the hand-held camera. Wolf is now in his element; gliding 
               like Nureyev with the camera. When he pans suddenly with 
               Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of camera 
               range.

               Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly. 
               Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of Nicole. 
               Wolf glides forward with the camera, framing an amazing CU 
               of the apple with Nicole seen behind it. Nicole reaches out, 
               grabs the apple and takes a huge, resounding bite out of it.

               CU Nick's face, eyes wide in anxious delight.

               Cora takes one step forward. CU her fuzzy slippers stopping 
               right on the yellow tape mark. Cora waits momentarily until 
               Wolf has reframed both her and Nicole, then lets out a huge 
               laugh.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

                                     NICK
                         And cut!!

               General mayhem erupts on the set.

                                     NICK
                         Wolf, talk to me, man! Did you get 
                         it?

                                     WOLF
                         Got it, Nick! Everything!

                                     NICK
                         The Close-up?

                                     WOLF
                         Perfect. See? That's what I meant 
                         about going hand-held!

                                     NICK
                         You're a genius, man! What about the 
                         focus?!

                                     AC
                         Nailed it.

                                     WOLF
                         Fuckin' A!

               Wolf slaps the AC's palm, then the Gaffer's standing right 
               beside him. He turns gleefully to the next person but seeing 
               it is Wanda he rigidly turns away.

                                     WANDA
                         Going again, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         How was the sound?

                                     SOUND
                         I could use another but definitely 
                         acceptable.

               Nick runs up to his mother and throws his arms around her. 
               Nicole stands beside him.

                                     NICK
                         Mom, you kook! That was incredible! 
                         Did you know we were filming?

                                     CORA
                              (testily)
                         Of course I knew you were filming.

                                     NICK
                         You were great, you're a natural. 
                         And Nicole, that was beautiful. Don't 
                         you dare tell me that felt fake.

               Suddenly, on an impulse surprising both of them, Nick and 
               Nicole embrace. Just then Wanda steps up.

                                     WANDA
                         Going again, Nick?

                                     NICK
                         Oh, hold on. Let me think a second.

               The set grows suddenly quiet as Nick begins pacing rapidly, 
               muttering to himself.

                                     NICK
                         Can I use it for the Dream Sequence, 
                         that's the question. Does it work 
                         for the Dream Sequence?

               Nick suddenly looks up and sees everybody staring at him; 
               Nicole in her wedding gown, Wolf with his eyepatch, his mother 
               still eating the apple, Wanda, the crew.

                                     NICK
                         We're going with it, Wanda!

                                     WANDA
                         Alright everyone, listen up. That is 
                         a wrap on Scene Six.

               The set erupts in applause.

                                     SOUND
                         Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

                                     WANDA
                         What?!

                                     SOUND
                         I need to record room tone. I'll 
                         need thirty seconds of silence.

                                     WANDA
                         Oh, alright! Quiet. Quiet! Shut up!! 
                         Thirty seconds of room tone. The 
                         sooner you're quiet the sooner we're 
                         done.

                                     CORA
                              (whispers to Nick)
                         What's room tone?

                                     NICK
                         It's for the sound, Mom. We just 
                         have to be quiet.

               At that moment a door opens at the rear of the set and a 
               DOCTOR and NURSE enter. The Nurse carries an extra overcoat. 
               Jeff, the Driver, turns and sternly whispers for them to be 
               quiet.

                                     WANDA
                         And roll sound. Nobody move.

                                     SOUND
                         Speed.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               The camera is wide, showing the entire set, actors, and crew. 
               Everyone stands in perfect silence, as motionless as statues. 
               As the silence continues the mood on the set gradually 
               changes. One by one people drift into their own private worlds 
               of reflection.

               MS the Sound man, alternately watching his recorder and his 
               stopwatch. Behind him the Boom man holds the mike in position 
               to record general ambiance while staring off into the 
               distance.

               CU the tape recorder spinning in quiet precision.

               CU the stopwatch, its giant second hand showing five seconds 
               have passed.

               MS Nick standing next to his mother who drapes one arm 
               casually over Nick's shoulder. Nick glances up and sees Nicole 
               beside him, absorbed in her own thoughts. Suddenly she looks 
               up and her eyes meet Nick's. She slips him the barest hint 
               of a smile.

               The camera DOLLIES slowly through the standing, silent group, 
               passing over faces in different degrees of thought.

               CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing 
               ten seconds have passed.

               MS Nick. He is so immersed in thought he looks at no one. 
               The camera slowly DOLLIES into a CU of him.

               INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY

               CHAD PALOMINO stands at a gleaming podium, looking radiant 
               in an immaculate tuxedo. He holds an envelope in his hands.

                                     CHAD
                         We have a new category this year: 
                         Best Film Ever Made by a Human Being. 
                         And the winner is none other than my 
                         Best Bud, Nick Reve!

               Amid thunderous applause Nick bounds on the stage and accepts 
               an Oscar from Chad. He stands grinning like an idiot as the 
               applause continues.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               MS Nick, still wrapped in thought, his lips starting to form 
               the same idiotic smile. MS Nicole. The camera DOLLIES slowly 
               into her face, now tinged with a slight uneasiness.

               INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT

               Wide shot at the counter. Nicole stands facing a large bald 
               man with his back to the camera. She is wearing a cheap pink 
               waitress uniform and has her hair under a hairnet.

                                     MAN
                         Had any experience?

                                     NICOLE
                         I was an actress for a while.

               She pulls her headshot out of her shoulder bag and hands it 
               to the man with a hopeful smile. He flips over the headshot 
               and looks at her credits with confused annoyance.

                                     MAN
                         Yeah, but can you cook a hamburger?

                                     NICOLE
                              (doubtfully)
                         Probably.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               MS Nicole. She jerks her head slightly in response to this 
               moment of thought.

               CU the stopwatch, showing fifteen seconds have passed.

               MS Wolf. The camera begins a slow DOLLY into his CU.

               INT. WANDA'S APT. DAY

               Wolf stands like Thor in the middle of the Red Set, his arms 
               crossed over his chest, his jaw set in determination. Smoke 
               billows around him. At his feet, dressed in Nicole's wedding 
               gown, Wanda sobs hysterically.

                                     WANDA
                         Wolf, I'm sorry! Please forgive me! 
                         I love you, Wolf! Please! Give me 
                         one more chance. Let me prove it! I 
                         love you! I love you, Wolf!

               Wolf remains unmoved for a long moment. Finally he reaches 
               out with a forgiving smile and pats Wanda's head.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               MS Wolf. He glances furtively at Wanda with a trace of hope 
               still in his eyes.

               MS Wanda, looking off. The camera DOLLIES into her CU.

               INT. A CHEAP HOTEL ROOM

               This is the same hotel room from Part Two, in which we saw 
               Nicole and Chad Palomino. At the moment Wanda and Chad lie 
               panting in the sweat-soaked sheets.

                                     WANDA
                         What I love about you, Chad, is you're 
                         not afraid of my power.

                                     CHAD
                         Oh God, Wanda! I love your power. 
                         It's like an afferdesiac to me!

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               MS Wanda. She shifts slightly and glances quickly around 
               her. Her smile is tinged with the hint of sexual pleasure.

               MS the Gaffer, frowning, absorbed in thought. The camera 
               DOLLIES into a CU of him.

               INT. A CHEAP RESTAURANT. DAY

               Suddenly, a CU of an incredibly beautiful hamburger being 
               placed in a toasted bun on a gleaming white oval plate. A 
               hand places a garnish of parsley on it then carries the plate 
               to the lunch counter. Camera PANS to reveal the GAFFER sitting 
               on the stool. He picks up the hamburger and takes a huge 
               bite out of it. This shot holds for quite some time as he 
               continues to chew.

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               MS The Gaffer. A hopeful, delicious smile spreading over his 
               face.

               CU the Sound man's stopwatch, the giant second hand showing 
               twenty seconds have passed.

               MS Cora. She gazes serenely out before her.

               INT. NURSING HOME. DAY

               In the pale afternoon light, Cora stands in the middle of 
               her drab, barren room. She appears to be staring at the door. 
               Suddenly she begins striding toward it. Effortlessly, easily, 
               she walks right through it.

               INT. AN AWARDS CEREMONY

               Nick still stands at the podium with his Oscar.

                                     NICK
                         In closing I'd like to say to all 
                         the people who told me not to make 
                         this movie, who wouldn't meet with 
                         me or return a simple phone call. To 
                         my favorite professor at Film School 
                         whose parting advice to me was to 
                         take a job teaching at a women's 
                         college. To Delores DelSporto, the 
                         girl I loved in high school who left 
                         me for a Jr. Varsity football player: 
                         to all these people I'd like to say 
                         thank you but I can't because what I 
                         really feel like saying is go fu --
                         !!

               INT. THE SET. DAY

               MS Nick, his head and body jerking in a sudden spasm. He 
               finishes the last word of his speech in a choked whisper and 
               the Sound man frowns hard at him.

               CU the Sound man's stopwatch showing twenty-five seconds 
               have passed. The camera stays on the watch until the final 
               five seconds have elapsed.

                                     SOUND
                         And, that's a cut on room tone.

               The room erupts with activity. Everyone moves and talks at 
               once. Nick whispers something to Nicole then runs off.

                                     WANDA
                         OK, strike the set. Props! Art 
                         Department! Redress for Scene thirty-
                         one. Let's go! Right away people! 
                         Nick! Nick! Anyone seen Nick?!

               WS the set. Suddenly the fake door closes right into the 
               lens, turning the frame completely BLACK.

               END CREDITS.

                                         THE END
Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels

By Guy Ritchie




INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT

This whole scene is shot using only extreme close-ups of eyes, cards, 
tapping fingers and mouths. We open on a bright  pair of eyes. One is 
bruised and slightly swollen, but this does not detract from their 
clarity.

EDDY
Three card brag is a simple form of poker; you are dealt only three 
cards and these you can't change. If you don't look at your cards 
you're a `blind man' and you only put in half the stake. Three of any 
kind is the highest you can get: the odds are four hundred and twenty-
five to one. Then it's a running flush - you know, all the same suit 
running in order; then a straight, then a flush, then a pair, and 
finally whatever the highest card you are holding. There are some tell-
tale signs that are valuable; I am not going to tell you them because 
it took me long enough to learn them, but these can only help a player, 
not make one. So you want to play?

DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE FIRST OF THE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

FADE IN:

What have you got?

We cut to a beady pair of eyes and then to his cards as they are turned 
over: three hearts of no consecutive numbers are exposed. That's a good 
hand. A flush beats my pair. What about you?

* Cut from completed film.

Another pair of excited eyes widen to the question. We see more cards: 
a run is revealed.

And here's me trying to explain the game to you. Hustlers, you're all 
hustlers!

We cut to a shot of a small amount of money being scooped up. OK! You 
got some real money?

DISSOLVE TO BLACK: MORE CREDITS APPEAR ON THE SCREEN.

FADE IN:

Ed scoops up a large pile of money.

Odds chaps, you gotta remember the odds.

There ? a loud slam of a door. We cut to a wide shot of a policeman 
who has just entered. It is then revealed that two of the three players 
are also policemen. They stand to attention, red faced with 
embarrassment.

SERG
I hope I am not interrupting. Comfortable, Edward?

EDDY
I haven't slept for forty-eight hours, got a dozen broken ribs, can 
feel a case of the flu coming on and . . .

SERG
(interrupts)
All right, all right, don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; 
but before I do, I need to know what's going on, son.

EDDY
If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.

DISSOLVE TO BLACK. THE MUSIC STARTS.

We pull back out of the black to reveal that we have been sitting in 
the inside of a shotgun. The barrels recede further, then `boom.' LOCK 
STOCK are shot out of the top of the screen in peppered letters. We 
wait for a while, as the barrels reappear through. the smoke. We then 
see one smoking barrel; 'boom!' the other is let off: AND TWO SMOKING 
BARRELS joins the sentence.]

EXT. STREET (FLASHBACK] - DAY

We open on a smart, casually dressed man selling perfume and jewellery 
on a street corner. A crowd has gathered, attracted by the alarming 
volume at which he is advertising his wares.

BACON
See these goods, they never seen daylight, moonlight, Israelite, Fanny-
by-the-gas-light. If you can't see value here today you're not up here 
shopping, you're up here shoplifting. Take a bag, take a bag. I took a 
bag, I took a bag home last night and she cost a lot more than ten 
pounds I can tell ya. Tell me if I am going too cheap. Not ninety, not 
eighty, not forty, half that and half that again, that's right, ten 
pounds. Don't think 'cos it's sealed up it's an empty box. The only man 
who sells empty boxes is the undertaker, and by the look of some of you 
here today I would make more money with me measuring tape.

A well-dressed, zealous character (Eddy) appears from behind the crowd 
waving money. It seems he can't wait to get rid of it.

EDDY
Bargain, that's a bloody bargain if I ever heard one. Ten pounds you 
say? I'll have five.

Certainly sir. I'll just wrap.

Changing his attention.

BACON
Excuse me misses, sorry sir, ladies first and all that.

A tourist spectator, rather than a buyer, has been. put on the spot. 
She fumbles through her bag hastily all too aware of the attention of 
the crowd, of which she is now the focus. She passes her money like 
it's contaminated. Others follow suit.

Buy 'em, you better buy 'em; they're not stolen, they just never been 
paid for.

This really stokes the fire. The money can't come fast enough. Just as 
business reaches its peak there is a call of alarm from the first 
enthusiastic punter, who seems to be rather more familiar than he first 
pretended.

EDDY
Bacon!

Bacon's expression changes dramatically. A series of crash zooms 
between Ed's, Bacon's and a third party's eyes (the police) reveal 
there is a problem. They're off: EDDY and BACON run like they have done 
this before. They go down an ally; Ed jumps some stairs, we freeze.

BACON
(voice-over)
Ed can run fast, talk fast, eat fast, and play cards fast, but he's 
fucking slow when it comes to spotting the roz.

EDDY
(voice-over)
The reason he is called BACON is he spent so much of his youth in the 
police station that people thought he was one of them. But he is a big 
boy now and it is time to move on.

We cut to a shot of Ed as he lands. He has made good distance.

INT. GROCER'S SHOP - MORNING

EDDY arrives at a grocer's shop. We meet Tom. Tom is talking to Nick 
the Greek.

TOM
What are you talking about? I am bloody skinny, pal.

NICK
Of course you are. All right, Ed.

EDDY
Nick the Greek, always a pleasure. All right Tom, what you been eating?

Tom examines his midriff and adopts a confused expression.

TOM
Please, both join me in my orifice.

INT. GROCER'S SHOP STORE ROOM - DAY

They work their way past a maze of boxes.

NICK
(fingering and admiring one of the boxes)
How much did you say it was, Tom?

TOM
You know how much it is, Nick.

NICK
And that does include the amp?

TOM
You know it doesn't include the amp.

INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN -AFTERNOON

Tom and Ed make their way through a busy, well-equipped kitchen. This 
is obviously a smart and serious establishment. They stop in front of 
the man whose uniform is covered in blood; he appears to be the head 
chef. Meet Soap.

TOM
What have you come as?

SOAP
Cupid stupid! That's the last time I am getting any more fruit off you 
Tom. Call that fresh? There was more small hairy armoured things in 
your fruit than there was fruit. You should open a butcher's, not a 
grocer's.

TOM
If you will order stuff that comes from Kat-Man-Fucking-Du don't be 
surprised if your fruit picks up a few tourists en route. ~ Never mind 
that, what about the money?

SOAP
Get your fingers out of my soup!

SLOW MOTION

Soap pulls out a bag from under where he is sitting.

TOM
(voice-over)
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any 
unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that 
it's legal.

BACON
(voice-over)
 He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he 
doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.

16

RELEASE SLOW MOTION]

Ed looks in bag.

EDDY
Are you sure you can afford twenty-five?

SOAP
Well that depends on how you look at it. I can afford it as long as I 
see it again, if that's what you mean. You got the rest from the fat 
man and Bacon?

Tom looks on with suspicion.

TOM
Who's this fat man, then?

EDDY
Bacon, the fat man and myself, and it's time to make a call to Harry.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

A hard-looking man of about fifty is sat behind a large antique desk. 
On this desk is a hatchet resting in a block of wood, poised like a 
judge's hammer. Harry is obviously in the sex game. Cluttered up in a 
hazardous way are a selection of dildos, spanking paddles, etc. A 
cabinet of fine-looking shotguns is placed behind. We have a split 
screen involving EDDY and his friends (listening in) and Hatchet with 
one hand on the phone and the other on a shotgun.

HATCHET
You got it all?

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

EDDY
A hundred grand.

FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET

TOM
(voice-over)
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved 
has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.

EDDY
(voice-over)
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry 
as some including himself like to call him.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET

HATCHET
Well if you got it, you got it. Now, if you don't mind . . .

The phone is slammed down.

SHOT OF HATCHET

SOAP
(voice-over)
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts 
that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.

BACON
(voice-over)
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's 
stone cold heart.

Cut from completed film.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF HATCHET

HATCHET
What's this EDDY like, then?

The camera spins round to reveal a massive monster of a man sitting 
opposite Hatchet. Meet Barry the Baptist.

FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY

EDDY
(voice-over)
Hatchet has a colleague, a monster of a man: Barry the Baptist.

BACON
(voice-over)
The Baptist got his name from drowning people for Hatchet.

TOM
(voice-over)
But he needs him, because he is good at making sure debts get settled 
and jobs get done.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF BARRY

BARRY
EDDY been shaking the knees of a lot of good players. The boy has a 
rare ability, he seems to make cards transparent, got bluffing dow . . 
.

HATCHET
(interrupts)
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.

BARRY
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.

HATCHET
Where did he get a hundred grand?

20

BARRY

He has got some adhesive mates, they have tossed up between them.

HATCHET
And JD is his dad, and owns the whole property?

BARRY
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, 
I got it under control.

HATCHET
Good, you can get this under control now.

A glossy Christie's brochure displaying a pair of impressive antique 
hammer-lock shotguns is shoved in Barry's face.

It seems Lord Appleton Smythe has run out of money, and these little 
beauties are up for auction, but I am not paying quarter of a million 
quid for 'em, if you know what I mean Barry. One of my associates has 
given me an address and the location of these lovelies. Make sure we 
get everything from inside the gun cabinet. I don't want to know who 
you use, as long as they are not complete muppets; and don't tell them 
what they're worth.

Changing the subject.

'Ere! Hold on, what do you think of these? We are selling hundreds.

Holds up one of the spanking paddles.

BARRY
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?

HATCHET
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!

The paddle is brought down hard on the desk: slap.

INT. TORTURE ROOM - DAY

Meet the Dog. Dog is horrible. He is large and intimidating. 
Administering pain is Dog's forte. He is also the Guy we cut from the 
last scene `slap' to the teeing of a golf ball. Wallop. Dog pulls a 
sadistic and alarmingly pleasurable face.

DOG
It's a dog eat dog world, lads, and I got bigger teeth than you.

We see an individual hanging upside down tied up with gaffer tape but 
otherwise naked. An orange is stuck in the man's mouth. Dog is standing 
on another man's chest who has a tee stuck between his teeth from where 
Dog fires golf balls at the other unfortunate figure. The tied-up man 
is Gordon. The other is Slick. Gordon nods his head erratically 
implying that he has reached a decision.

(to Plank)
I think your man is trying to say something.

Pause.

Perhaps not; maybe I should have another swing just to make sure.

Agonised muffled screaming from Gordon. Slick (who has a tee in his 
mouth) shuts his eyes in horror as the golf ball thumps into Gordon.

Yes, Gordon, is there something you would like to tell us?

The orange is removed from Gordon's mouth.

GORDON
(rushing to get the words out)
In the kitchen, under the floor . . .

SLICK
(interrupts)
Shut it, you idiot . . .

Dog swings the golf club round Slick's jaw, knocking him unconscious.

DOG
You were saying?

GORDON
It's in the karzi, pull the fishing wire under the seat. Jesus, for 
god's sake let me down.

PLANK
Oh, Dog! . . . I think you want to have a look at this!

Plank returns holding an assortment of drugs and cash. Gordon starts to 
scream. Dog picks up a steel for sharpening knives and throws it across 
the room. Thunk. Silence follows. Plank grimaces.

Oh, Dog!

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - EVENING

Ed, Bacon, Soap and Tom park outside their house. As they get out they 
pass Plank and John who have also just parked. They ignore each other, 
and go to their separate doors.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

BACON places a pile of money on a table. The rest are eating, Tom keeps 
looking at his plate distastefully.

BACON
Twenty-five from me, Tom, Soap and yourself; a hundred grand to the 
pound. You don't need to count it.

EDDY
I still will, if you don't mind.

TOM
(eating)
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and 
twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous 
experiences.

SOAP
That's going on optimism.

TOM
Whatever it's going on, it's still enough to send you on a cooking 
course.

SOAP
You're not funny Tom; you're fat and look as though you should be 
funny, but you're not.

Tom is definitely not overweight, quite the opposite in fact. He 
examines himself to see if something has developed.

TOM
Fat? Who are you calling fat? What are all these fat jokes about?

The light switch above Tom's head lets out a few sparks causing him to 
cower in a sharp defensive action.

Jesus! It's good in here, ain't it! Trains overhead, walls exploding . 
. . Why the hell did you move in?

EDDY
Because it's cheap like a budgie.

BACON
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; 
a bit anti-social, you know.

BACON beckons Tom to a cupboard built into the wall.

TOM
What do you mean?

EDDY
He means they're thieving dogs.

BACON
I mean when they are not picking peanuts out of poop, they're ripping 
off unfortunate souls of their hard-earned drugs.

BACON opens the cupboard doors and puts his finger to his lips. The 
noise from next door immediately gets louder.

Not exactly thick, these walls.

DOG
(off)
No you prat, that's for me.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dog has a small pile of money and pills that he is distributing to his 
lads.

DOG
How many times do I have to explain this to you, Plank? You find a job 
worth doing and you will find your share improving . . . Now do you 
have a problem with that?

He obviously doesn't.

INT. ED AIVD BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom raises his eyebrows and frowns to Bacon.

EXT. BIG BOY'S GYM/SOLARiUM - NIGHT

Meet Big Chris and Little Chris (twelve years old).

BIG CHRIS
How long has he been in there, son?

LITTLE CHRIS
About twenty minutes.

BIG CHRIS
Is he on his own?

LITTLE CHRIS
Just carrying a bag.

BIG CHRIS
Let's have a look, shall we?

INT. GYM/SOLARIUM - NIGHT

BIG CHRIS
Son, have a look under that one.

Little Chris looks under one of the sunbeds.

LITTLE CHRIS
It's not him, Dad.

BIG CHRIS
Try that one.

Little Chris returns from a peek and nods in confirmation.

LITTLE CHRIS
Sleeping like a baby.

Big Chris then approaches and raises the sunbed.

BIG CHRIS
This is one of those high-powered numbers, isn't it?

John O'Driscoll's eyes widen; Chris slams down the sunbed on top of him 
as hard as he can.

Got some bad news for you, John.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
What the fu-!

Big Chris slams down the sunbed on top of John.

BIG CHRIS
Mind your language in front of my boy.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
Jesus Christ!

Big Chris repeats the earlier treatment twice more.

BIG CHRIS
That includes blasphemy as well. Now tell me, John . . .

JOHN'O'DRISCOLL
Tell you what, Chris?

A man opens the sunbed mom door.

SUNBED MAN
I say, hold on.

LITTLE CHRIS
I say shut it!

SUNBED MAN
You what?

BIG CHRIS
He said shut it!

Chris pulls a mean face; the door is closed.]

Tell me John, how you can concentrate on improving a lovely tan, and it 
is a lovely tan by the way, when you have more pressing priorities at 
hand?

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
Tell Harry . . .

Bang as sunbed comes down again.

BIG CHRIS
Did I say speak? And it's Mr Harry to you . . . Now don't disappoint me 
and chose your words carefully. You may speak.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
I'll have it for Mr Harry in a few days. I have been busy, and I am 
nearly there.

BIG CHRIS
Son, have a look in his locker.

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
No chance of you lifting this sunbed up is there?

* Cut from completed film.

30

BIG CHRIS
Yeah, all right.

Big Chris lifts it, then smashes it down again. Now, you want me to 
lift it up again?

Little Chris pipes up. Obviously familiar with counting money he has 
flown through it.

LITTLE CHRIS
He's not poor. Five hundred and sixty pounds and that's just in his 
wallet . . . Fuckin' 'ell John, you always walk around with that in 
your pocket?

The expression on Big Chris's face changes.

BIG CHRIS
Oi! Next time you use language like that, boy, you'll wish you hadn't!

LITTLE CHRTS
Sorry, Dad.

BIG CHRIS
Right, well, put the rest of the stuff in that, son. You can go home in 
a plastic bag tonight, John. You owe what you owe arid before this tan 
has faded, you want to have paid.

Chris punches John unconscious and turns the time dial up.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

JD's bar is an impressive sort of uptown-downtown establishment with 
pretty girls serving a laddish clientele. The boys are propped up at 
the bar, looking straight ahead in silence. They look nervous. The 
silence is broken by Ed.

32

EDDY
I am going to the john.

He walks off.

TOM
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get 
your rest in.

SOAP
Tom, you're all heart.

TOM
Listen cooky, you want to make sure that man rests before he plays; 
it's in all our interests.

JD
(the bar owner and Ed's father)
All right lads? How's things? How's it going, Soap? Cooking all right? 
Where's that son of mine?

Each time a question is asked the lads try to answer but are just left 
with their mouths open, which remain open as a gorgeous girl walks 
through the bar (Daisy).

INT. SLOANES' HOUSE LABORATORY - NIGHT

We cut to a small, humid, artificially lit, illegal forest being 
cultivated for profit. Someone is smoking a joint and raising his 
eyebrows at his friend. These two characters are J and Charles; they 
have got hair down to their shoulders, small try-hard goatees and 
science-lab coats, with nothing much underneath.

J
(coughing)
This gear is getting heavier you know, Charles. I got a suspicion we 
should have been rocket scientists, or Noble Peace Prize winners or 
something.

A horn blows (the door bell).

CHARLES
Who the hell is that?

INT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT

The door opens to reveal Willy. Under each arm is a large bag of 
fertilizer.

WILLY
Give me a hand Charlie, I could break sweat at any second.

A voice comes from behind them. At the top of the stairs stands 
Winston. He slowly starts to walk down.

WINSTON
Charles, why have we got this cage?

Pause. Charlie shrugs.

CHARLIE
Er, for security.

WINSTON
That's right, for security. So tell me, Charles, what's the point in 
having it if we don't fucking use it?

CHARLIE
Well, because it's Willy and Willy lives here.

WINSTON
Yes Charlie, but you didn't know it was Willy, did you?

WILLY
Chill, Winston, it's me and Charlie can see it's me, so what's the 
problem?

WINSTON
The problem is, Willy, that Charlie and yourself are not the quickest 
of cats in the alley at the best of times, so just do as I say and keep 
the fucking cage locked.

Pause as the two in the door look slightly pissed off at being shouted 
at. Winston sighs and looks at what Willy is carrying.

WINSTON
What are you carrying, Willy?

WILLY
Er, fertilizer.

WINSTON
You went out six hours ago to buy a money counter and you come back 
carrying two bags of fertilizer. Alarm bells are ringing, Willy.

WILLY
We need fertilizer, Winston.

WINSTON
We also need a fucking money counter, William! We have to get the money 
out by Thursday and I'll be buggered if I am counting it . . . and if 
you have to get your sodding fertilizer, couldn't you be a little more 
subtle?

WILLY
What do you mean?

WINSTON
I mean we grow copious amounts of ganja, and you don't look like your 
average hort-er-fucking-culturalist, that's what I mean, Willy.

Winston turns on his heels and walks off. 35

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Ed returns to the bar to find Tom, Soap and BACON
looking in disbelief.

TOM
(pointing to watch)
What the hell are you doing here?

EDDY
Why, what's up?

TOM
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet 
Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!

Ed grimaces as his father approaches. He has overheard this last 
statement.

JD You playing cards tonight with Harry?

EDDY
(pauses)
Don't be silly Dad, I wouldn't have anything to do with that.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We calm down for a while. A cool track is playing. Ed is now smartly 
dressed, sitting in an armchair. We have a close-up of his face. He is 
motionless, eyes closed; he looks asleep. The camera slowly tracks down 
his body We reach a single hand; he is cutting the pack skilfully and 
faultlessly; he is very much awake. There is a knock on his door. His 
eyes open.

INT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT

Near-naked girls are gyrating against blue poles, which keep 
distracting these men's attention. Meet the two Scousers - Gary and 
Dean. The Scousers are in their late twenties, one big, one small. Gary 
(the smaller) sports a large demi-perm. They bear strong Liverpudlian 
accents. They are meeting Barry (Hatchet's man).

GARY
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?

BARRY
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . 
. Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There 
will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you 
deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.

GARY
(sarcastically)
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.

BARRY
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.

DEAN
Like what?

BARRY
Like antiques.

DEAN
Antiques? What the fuck do we know about antiques? We rob post offices 
and steal cars, what the fuck do we know about antiques?

BARRY
If it looks old, it's worth money, simple. So stop fucking moaning and 
rob the place.

GARY
So who's the Guv? Who we doing this for?

BARRY
You're doing it for me is all you need to know. You only know that 
because you need to know.

GARY
I see, one of those `on a need to know' basis things, like a James Bond 
film, is it?

BARRY
Careful, remember who's giving you this job.

A bit of confused eye-rolling goes on. Barry eventually looks at his 
watch.

I am off, it's all yours now. Call me when you're done.

As he leaves, the two Scousers eye him distastefully.

GARY
(to Dean)
I hate these Southern shites.

BARRY
(on his way out, whispering to himself)
Fucking Northern monkeys.

EXT. BOXING CLUB ENTRANCE - NIGHT

EDDY and the lads have all made an obvious effort with their 
appearance. They are met by a doorman.

DOORMAN
Invitations.

EDDY
Invitations?

DOORMAN
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name 
on it.

EDDY
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with 
the Queen on it. Will that do?

DOORMAN
All right, just you; the others can wait in Samoan Jo's next door.

EDDY
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .

DOORMAN
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I 
do mean no one.

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

EDDY enters the boxing gym on his own, and raises his eyebrows at the 
thought of climbing into the ring. Everybody else is sitting down 
counting their money and converting it to chips. Ed takes the only 
empty chair and has a quick look around, particularly behind.

EDDY
Evening Frazer, Phil, Don. This is a bit dramatic, isn't it? Is it 
supposed to be symbolic?

40

PHIL/DON
All right Ed. Apparently it's for security.

EDDY
I would have brought my gloves if I had known.

HATCHET
You must be Eddy. JD's son.

EDDY
Yup, you must be Harry? Sorry, I didn't know your father.

HATCHET
Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that.

There is an attractive blonde croupier shuffling the cards. EDDY

Evening Tanya, it has been a while.

EXT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT

As the boys walk in to Samoan Jo's, a man comes tearing out of the door 
covered in flames followed by his friends trying to put the flames out. 
The lads look on in mild shock.

TOM
I heard this place was rough.

EXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT

The Scousers make their way to the front door and unravel their lock-
picking kit. '

42

SAMOAN Jo's - NIGHT

SOAP
What sort of a pub is this then?

SAMOAN JO
A Samoan one. Anything else?

BACON
(receiving a monstrous, leafy cocktail)
What's that?

SAMOAN JO
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.

BACON
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a 
fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.

SAMOAN JO
You want a pint, go to the pub.

BACON
I thought this was a pub.

SAMOAN JO
It's a Samoan pub.

BACON
Well whatever it is, could you get your man to turn the TV down?

SAMOAN JO
You ask him if you like, but I would leave him to it if I was you.

BACON looks at Rory Breaker, the man watching the TV.

BACON
Excuse me, could you turn the TV down?

RORY BREAKER
No.

He takes a swig of whatever he is drinking and frowns at Bacon. BACON 
frowns back, then Soap interrupts.

SOAP
This is the English-Brazil game, isn't it?

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

CROUPIER
This is three card brag, gentlemen. That means that three threes is the 
highest, then three aces and then running down accordingly; then it's a 
running flush, a run, a flush, then a pair: An open man can't see a 
blind man, and it will cost you twice the anti to see your opponent. 
Don't fuck around, fellas; you all know the rules and you know I won't 
stand for it.

FRAZER
What sort of shirt is that then, Ed? 'Three hundred open.

EDDY
The type of shirt that has buttons on the front and collars at the top, 
Frazer. One hundred and fifty blind.

DON
Three hundred and fifty open.

PHIL
Fold.

* Cut from completed film.

HATCHET
Three hundred and fifty open.

FRAZER
You're the only fella in London who wears shirts like that. Three 
hundred and fifty open.

EDDY
No Frazer, it's just I'm the only classy fella you have had the 
pleasure of seeing in London. One hundred and seventy-five blind.

DON
Four hundred open.

HATCHET
Four hundred open.

FRAZER
Eight hundred. Like that, do ya, son?

EDDY
When my knees stop knocking I'll live with it. Four hundred blind.

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry, who is sitting among sweaty towels, takes out a four-inch 
monitor and switches it on, and hey presto we can see the card table. 
The camera is placed behind Ed in one of the four posts. Barry zooms 
in, pauses on the back of Ed's head, gets his focus and jibs down to 
view his cards, pauses and re focuses, because Ed is playing blind. He 
hasn't raised them: there is nothing Barry can do. We cut to Barry's 
other hand. He is pressing a button on a remote control. We cut 
straight to Harry's leg which is receiving the pulse.

46

BOXING GYM - NIGHT

HATCHET
Listen ladies, this is cards. Men play cards, you want to talk soft you 
should be at the fucking hairdressers, so shut up and play.
(dramatic pause)
I fold.

FRAZER
Two thousand open.

EDDY
One thousand blind.

DON
Two thousand open.

FRAZER
Deep end, eh? Fold.

EDDY
Two thousand blind.

DON
You what?

There is a pause as Don examines Ed's brow looking for a trace of  
nerves.

Two grand? You're still blind. You have been eating too much English 
beef, mate; honkers, mad.

HATCHET
Well, you going to play?

Cut from completed film.

DON
Fucking right I am going to play. Three thousand, there.

CROUPIER
Four thousand to an open man, you know that.

We can feel the confidence emanating from Eddy. Don continues to search 
Ed's forehead waiting for a break of nervous moisture, but it's as dry 
as a desert disco.

EDDY
Donald, do you know how to play this game? The reason I put in half the 
anti is because I don't know what I have got. Now play, or fold.

Silence.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT.

Don is thrown out on to the street, screaming and cursing.

EXT. STATELY HOME - NIGHT

The Scousers, having now entered, make their way through the large 
house.

DEAN
OK Gary, we call each other Kenny, all right?

GARY
All right, Kenny.

Dean looks at Gary's disguise with some distaste. He has a stocking 
pulled over only half his face. A sexy thigh grip is replicating an 
artificial, frilly moustache, not giving the desired menacing look. A 
big bouffant head of hair is neatly being conntrolled up on top.

DEAN
Can't you pull that stocking down further, Kenny?

GARY
It just cost me fifty quid to have this done.
(Lovingly rearranging his hair)
If you think I am going to ruin it for a couple of old bastards you're 
mistaken, Kenny.

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Music starts. We cut to a montage of Ed, Hatchet and Barry at work. Ed 
must be about 250,000 up but the game is getting out hand and pieces of 
paper are being signed; IOUs.

INT. STATELY HOME BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dean returns down a corridor carrying an armful of rifles and enters a 
large bedroom. There are a couple of toffs (English aristocrats) tied 
up in bed. The old man has bits of tissue between is toes which Gary 
has seen fit to light, in order to extract information. Briefly meet 
Lord and Lady Appleton Smythe Winston and Daisy's parents).

DEAN
What are you doing, Kenny?

Gary is on the point of lighting another piece of tissue.

GARY
Finding out where he keeps the money.

48 49

DEAN
Kenny, you twat, does it look like these people have got any money? 
They can't even afford new furniture. We've got the guns; now if you 
don't mind . . .

At that moment they are interrupted by the sound of a shotgun 
cartridge. The ancient butler has made an unexpected entrance. He is 
holding an equally ancient pair of hammer-lock guns (the ones from the 
catalogue) which he has obviously got little control of. The recoil 
knocks the butler clear off his feet. The second shot hits the ceiling 
covering the old boy in plaster.

We cut to a POV of the butler on his back. We see Dean looking down.

You want to be more careful, old fella. You very nearly took my man's 
head clean off with that. You all right, Kenny?

We cut to a shaking shell-shocked Gary, mouth agape. The gun shot has 
torn through the centre of Gary's bouffant hairdo leaving him with a 
pair of smoking Mickey Mouse ears. Shock prevents him from answering.

Kenny?

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

EDDY
Ten grand blind.

We see Hatchet feeling his leg; he looks shifty

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry zooms in again; he can see nothing.

HATCHET
Twenty thousand open.

EDDY looks at his cards: he has a running flush.

EDDY
Twenty thousand open.

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barrv sighs with relief and types in the relevant information.

INT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Having received this information Hatchet pauses, then . . .

HATCHET
I'll fold.

We hear lots of oohs and aahs. EDDY frowns slightly This is odd play. 
Rather than looking happy he has a discrete glance over his shoulder; 
satisfied that nothing can be amiss, he collects his money.

Don't go spending, that all at once, boy.

INT. BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry's phone rings. He jumps in shock and fishes around to find it.

BARRY
What?

50 ~ 51

INT. RED PHONE BOX - NIGHT

The Scousers reply; Gary is still unable to speak due to his shotgun 
experience.

DEAN
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!

BARRY
You get the guns?

DEAN
You should see what they did to poor Gary.

Gary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state. He obviously 
doesn't know what day of the week it is.

DEAN
Gary, get back into the van!

Barry frowns down the telephone. Yeah, yeah, we got 'em.

BARRY
Good. I'll speak to you later.

Barry clicks the phone off. Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as 
if speaking to a deaf person.

DEAN
Gary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the 
van now, OK?

Dean takes his arm and guides him back into the van.

BOXING GYM - NIGHT

Stakes have increased dramatically. There is a pause as Frazer looks at 
his cards.

EDDY
Twenty thousand open.

PHIL
OK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going 
on here. I fold.

HATCHET
Got some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy?

Hatchet looks impatiently at the door.

EDDY
Fifty grand.

Hatchet scours Ed's forehead. It is still dry.

HATCHET
Eighty grand.

BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

Barry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly 
zooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just
enough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards!

Ed's got nothing but a pair of sixes. Barry excitedly starts tapping 
away.

53

INT. BOXING GYM - MGHT

EDDY
One hundred grand.

FRAZER
Hold on fellas, I know . . .

HATCHER (interrupts j
I know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know. Two 
hundred and fifty.

Hatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a 
nervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills 
frame. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow 
Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the 
pause is broken.

EDDY
That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred.

HATCHET
Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY

As you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough 
to continue.

Pause.

CROUPIER
We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to 
continue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.

Silence follows. A lot of nose scratching and examining of imaginary 
dirty ftngernails spreads contagiously throughout the remaining 
company.

It doesn't look . . .

HATCHET
(interrupts)
I will.

EDDY
You will what?

HATCHET
I will loan you the money.

Silence. The sweat bead reaches the bottom of Ed's chin, trembles for a 
second, then unattaches itself. Very slowly it falls. We follow its 
long silent journey. Eventually it is greeted by the back of Ed's 
cards. It explodes dramatically in sound and vision, symbolizing this 
worrying news.

EDDY
I think I would rather just turn them over.

HATCHET
I am not interested in what you would rather; I want to keep going. I 
am also offering you the money, so we don't have to turn them over 
because you can borrow.

EDDY
I need two hundred and fifty grand.

HATCHET
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.

Ed's face is now awash, busily blistering with sweat.

EDDY
That's if I want to see you.

HATCHET
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.

The pause is painful.

55

CRUOPIER
You can still fold.

EDDY doesn't like the sound of this. There is sympathy in her voice. 
Harry looks sharply through narrowed eyes at the croupier; the croupier 
pleads with Eddy.

EDDY
I'll see ya.

HATCHET
For half a million?

EDDY
Unless you are going to accept twenty quid.

HATCHET
And still got a sense of humour. That's not monkey nuts son; you can 
still fold.
(Pause)
OK, before I loan you this, I expect, if you lose of course, my money 
back within a week, Crystal? That's Sunday, OK?

These last few words echo in the distance of Ed's mind (and ours). He 
is committed, but has now left the world of the conscious. Hatchet 
turns over the first card; it's a seven. EDDY
ushers him on; another seven, it looks as though he will have three; 
then the third: it's a four. There is an anti-climatic silence. After a 
loud pause . . .

CROUPIER
Is that it?

* Cut from completed film.

56

FRAZER
He was bluffing!

Hatchet looks content and rather nonchalant.

HATCHET
Let's see your fucking cards.

Nobody is impressed by Hatchet's cards; all eyes fall on EDDY 
expectantly We crash in to Ed's pupils with a loud swoosh. They 
contract to the size of pinheads. His world has changed for ever.

FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY

EDDY
(voice-over)
I knew he was bluffing, but somehow the worst card player round the 
table had fucked me like a frozen virgin with a pair of sevens. A 
series of blows to my head with a baseball bat would have been greeted 
with a grin compared to this. Ten minutes earlier, I was two hundred 
thousand pounds richer; now I owed half a million.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF EDDY

Harry approaches Ed and whispers in his ear.

HATCHET
I know your friends are responsible for most of that cash, so I'll give 
you all a week to find it. After that, I'll take a finger off each of 
you and your friend's hands for each day that passes without payment; 
and when you have all run out of digits, then who knows what?

Ed gets up. We stumble with him in slow motion. He is hardly able to 
stand. He wobbles over to the door. Harry continues to talk over the 
top.

Business is business, and I am good at making mine work. I like your 
dad's bar, JD's, so don't get clever or lethargic. If you can't pay in 
a week, a few fingers and a bar for starters.

Ed stumbles out of the door, doubles up and vomits all over the f door.

INT. SAMOAN JO'S - NIGHT

Ed has made his way into the bar. All his friends have fallen asleep. 
One of Bacon's eyes opens to see Ed cleaning himself up.

BACON
This doesn't look good.

The others wake on this statement. We cut between the lads and their 
frozen reaction.

FREEZE SHOT OF LADS IN SHOCK

EDDY
(voice-over)
I then explained the unfortunate position we were in. Harry was going 
to start sizing up all our fingers in a week, 'cause he knew there was 
no way I could raise that kind of money on my own. Harry saw it as 
their money on the table so it was also their debt off the table. I 
hate to admit it but I could have kissed the old bastard for that. If I 
said I wanted to settle this debt on my own it would have been a lie.

RELEASE FREEZE SHOT OF LADS

EDDY
Listen, I wish he would let me settle it on my own.

Tom drops his drink and rushes Eddy.

58

TOM
I'll kill him!

BACON
(intercepts Tom)
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?

SOAP
What's all the fuss about Harry? Why don't we just boycott the payment?

They all look at Soap like he is mad.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S' OFFICE - NIGHT

BACON
(voice-over)
Let me tell you about Hatchet Harry. Once there was this geezer called 
Smithy Robinson who worked for Harry. It was rumoured that he was on 
the take. Harry invited Smithy round for an explanation. Smithy didn't 
do a very good job. Within a minute Harry lost his temper and reached 
for the nearest thing at hand, which happened to be a fifteen-inch 
black rubber cock. He then proceeded to batter poor Smithy to death 
with this; that was seen as a pleasant way to go . . . Hence, Hatchet 
Harry is a man you pay if you owe.

EDDY
I'll think of something, don't worry.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ed, who looks like he is close to suicide, has developed a two-day 
stubble and his eyes have disappeared into black sockets. He stumbles 
along the street with a bottle of scotch poking out of a pocket. He 
stops outside JD's, looks at the entrance and decides not to go in.

60

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY The ridiculous door-bell horn blows.

J
Who the hell's that. It's only twelve.

WINSTON
Use that cage, that's what it's there for.

WILLIAM
(off)
Who is it?

PLANK
(off)
Plank, open up.

This is done without the use of the steel-caged security door.

This weed is getting quite a reputation, you know, fellas. Gloria 
remains motionless in her chair. Plank waves his hand about in a sort 
of `how you doing' way to everyone and goes to take a seat. At the last 
minute, poised like he is sitting on a potty he realizes he is about to 
sit on this girl.

Jesus! Never saw you there. Hello, love. Enjoying yourself?

Gloria doesn't respond. Plank waves his hand over her face. Still no 
response. Plank looks around for some acknowledgement.

Is she, er, compus?

WINSTON
(doesn't look up)
What do you think?

Plank takes a close look at the girl.

61

GIRL
BOO!

Plank jumps back, completely taken by surprise, knocking over a 
pedestal of shoe boxes stacked up against a wall, full of fifty-pound 
notes.

PLANK
Fuck me!

Charles, pissed off, looks at William like it's his fault.

CHARLES
Fod God's sake.

WILLIAM
Clean that up, Charles.

CHARLES
Sod you, you clean it up.

PLANK
Sorry fellas, but that stupid cow!

WILLIAM
Never mind, could you please just sit down and stay out of the way.

WINSTON
Anyway, how much do you want?

PLANK
(trying to look like the money hasn't had an impact on him)
I am after a half weight.

WINSTON
That's one and a half thousand. Pass those scales, Willie, and sort out 
the gear, Charlie. Any chance of seeing your money?

INT. JD' S BAR - DAY

Cut to Bacon, Soap and Tom sitting and talking in the back of JD's bar. 
They don't look a lot better than Ed.

BACON
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.

SOAP
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds 
are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON
. . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?

BACON
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.

SOAP
It's hit us all hard!

BACON
Yeah, but he has got to tell his Dad he is about to lose his bar.

Tom, who has not really been listening, suddenly interrupts.

TOM
Listen to this one then; you open a company called the Arse Tickler's 
Faggot Fan Club. You take an advert in the back page of some gay mag, 
advertising the latest in arse-intruding dildos, sell it a bit with, er 
. . . I dunno, `does what no other dildo can do until now', latest and 
greatest in sexual technology. Guaranteed results or money back, all 
that bollocks. These dills cost twenty-five each; a snip for all the 
pleasure they are going to give the recipients. They send a cheque to 
the company name, nothing offensive, er, Bobbie's Bits or something, 
for twenty-five. You put these in the bank for two weeks and let them 
clear. Now this is the clever bit. Then you send back the cheques for 
twenty-five pounds from the real company name, Arse Tickler's Faggot 
Fan Club, saying sorry, we couldn't get the supply from America, they 
have sold out. Now you see how many of the people cash those cheques; 
not a single soul, because who wants his bank manager to know he 
tickles arses when he is not paying in cheques!

There is a long pause while BACON considers this.

BACON
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?

TOM
Probably no longer than four weeks.

BACON
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six 
. . . no, five days?

TOM
Well, it's still a good idea.

SOAP
Listen to this one . . .

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

We see the back of a head.

DOG
So do you know these geezers well?

PLANK
Well enough. I have been buying gear off one of them for a couple of 
years.

DOG
What they like then?

PLANK
Poofs. Nothing heavy, four public school guys. Soft as shite.

INT. JD'S BAR - DAY

Soap is finishing off his suggestion for raising money.

SOAP
And you keep all the money'

Pause. BACON and Tom frown at Soap.

TOM
I have heard some fucking stupid ideas in my time but yours makes 
Bacon's sound inspired.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Ed fumbles with his keys at his front door. He enters his house in a 
sort of zombie state, takes off his jacket and opens the cupboard 
doors. He hangs his coat up (it promptly falls off" the hanger) and he 
collapses in a pile on the floor. The cupboard doors now being open, he 
can clearly hear next door's discussion. We track in very slowly on Ed.

PLANK
They ponce around in funny hippie clothes all day, talking bollocks. 
They're just good at growing weed, that's all, and business has got 
bigger than what they can keep up with.

INT. JD'S BAR - DAY

SOAP
If you're so fucking clever why don't you come up with a suggestion?

BACON
I am thinking, I am thinking.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

DOG
(off)
Listen, they can't be all stupid if they got a container load of cash 
sitting in shoe boxes, a skip-load of Class A gear and you don't think 
there is anybody sensible involved.

We reach the end of our track. Ed's head is on a pitiful angle in full 
close-up. It straightens and his dark eyes widen immediately on this 
news.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

DOG

What about security?

PLANK
There's one steel gate as you go in but they never lock it.

DOG
What do you mean, never? Well what have they got it for, then?

PLANK
I must have been there fifty times, it's never been locked; they're not 
suspicious. Everybody who goes there are toffs. They're all into that 
karma crap: `If I don't harm nobody, nobody harms me' stuff.

DOG
Is there no way they can get back to you?

PLANK
Even if they could they'd be too shit scared. They have got no muscle; 
they're gutless faggots.

66 ~ 67

IN'T. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Barry and Harry are talking. Harry is polishing a shotgun. It is very 
different in appearance to the hammer-locks.

HATCHET

Is Big Chris on his way?

BARRY
Should be here any minute. I think you're making a mistake, Harry. 
That's a lot of money for Chris to be running after. I wouldn't trust 
him to bring it back here.

Hatchet's speech is laced with cut-aways of Big Chris in action, and on 
the ascent (with Little Chris) of Hatchet's stairs.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY

HATCHET
(voice-over) 
What do you know about Chris, eh? You put Big Chris on a job and he 
will make sure it gets done, no matter what's in his way. His dad used 
to collect debts and his dad before that, and that monster of a boy 
will after he has gone. It seems that the Almighty himself requested 
them to collect debts for eternity and not to fear knocking on old 
Nick's door himself, if he was behind on his payment. But he has never 
nicked a picker in his life. Straight as an arrow and as strong as the 
bow that fired it. If you dropped your tenner he would search till he 
found ya . . . the only problem is he isn't stable, has a temper like a 
runaway train, and he hits twice as hard. Heaven protect anyone who 
touches that boy, not that the boy needs protecting.

We see Big Chris walking up the stairs. He reaches the top and knocks 
on the door.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Big Chris is sitting in front of Hatchet, Barry behind Chris.

HATCHET

Want a drink?

BARRY
Hello son, would you like a lolly?

LITTLE CHRIS

Piss off you nonce!

BIG CHRIS

Oi, watch it! No thanks Harry, we are both all right. Nice shooter.

HATCHET
Like it? One of a pair, Holland and Holland. Here, you want to hold it?

BIG CHRIS

Nah, not my thing, thank you, Harry. Business good? I imagine that's 
what I am here for.

Harry leans the gun against the side of the desk and takes a seat, does 
a breast-stroke movement to clear his desk of all the sexual debris, 
takes a big breath of air and begins.

HATCHET

I want you to forget about any other debts at the moment; there are 
fresher fish to fry!

BIG CHRIS

Go on.

HATCHET

It's a bit of a priority. Four young fellas who got in deeper than they 
could handle; they owe me half a million pounds.

68 ~ 69

LITTLE CHRIS

How much?

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Tom, BACON
and Soap are sitting in front of Ed who looks as though he is about to 
launch in to a speech.

TOM
What's the flapping about? You told the old man yet? EDDY

I hope I won't need to. I got a plan. So listen carefully.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - NIGHT WINSTON

Look, he set us up. That means he put money into us, which means he 
expects money out of us. You don't need to be an economist to work that 
out.

J
He might think we smoke a lot and burn a bit of profit, but he can't 
have any idea about the hard currency we've accumulated. We can just 
slice it off the top.

WINSTON
You guys, you've got to realise who this chap is. He's a fucking 
lunatic. If he gets the slightest inkling that we are not throwing 
straight dice, you - and fuck it, me - are going to know what the sharp 
side of a kebab knife feels like.

*CHARLES Come on, we are in this for the cash however it comes.

The phone rings. Winston picks it up.

* Cut from completed film.

70

WINSTON
Hello.

DAISY 
(she is upset) 
Winston?

WINSTON
Yeah.

DAISY 
It's Daisy.

WINSTON
I know who it is. What's the problem?

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The situation has been explained. There are thoughtful frowns on all 
foreheads. There is a pause.

SOAP
Well, what do you want us to do about it?

EDDY
Hit the fuckers.

Pause while this is digested.

I know it sounds a bit heavy, but it's not like you are doing anything 
illegal.

BACON
I don't know how you've reached that conclusion.

EDDY
They can't report they have had all their drugs and money nicked, can 
they?

71

TOM
How heavy are the fellas anyway?

EDDY

They don't look all that.

SOAP

Hitler didn't look all that.

EDDY
All right, but for Christ's sake we're in the soup and this is the 
silver spoon. If you can think of another way to get out, let me know. 
It's not like we've got all the time in the world either . . . Dig?

Silence falls over them.]

BACON

I am game.

TOM

Me too.

S0AP

Oh, god!

EDDY
Well, we hit them as soon as they come back. We'll be waiting and 
prepared for them.

Pause as Ed's voice drops a little. And they are armed.

SOAP
What was that, armed? What do you mean, armed? Armed with what?

EDDY
Er, bad breath, colourful language and a feather duster! . . . What do 
you think they will be armed with? Guns, you tit!

SOAP
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the 
safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . 
.

EDDY
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...

SOAP

And what exactly?

EDDY
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.

SOAP
Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.

EDDY
No, just one of them is in charge of them going to the job. So I assume 
he will still

be carrying when he comes back from the job.

SOAP
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the 
brother of all fuck-ups?

TOM
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!

SOAP
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any 
difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking 
bullets!

72 ~ 73

EDDY

Soap, if you got a better idea to get five hundred grand in the next 
few days you let us know . . . In the meantime, Tom, speak to Nick the 
Bubble about moving the weed.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Tom and Nick are stuck away in a corner playing on a fruit machine.

NICK

Weed?

TOM
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think 
let alone move shit.

NICK
Doesn't sound very good to me.

TOM
Neither me, but it depends on what flicks your switch, and the light's 
on and burning bright for the masses.

NICK

You'll need samples, Tom.

TOM

No can do.

NICK

Where's that? A place near Katmandu? Meet me half way, mate.

TOM
Listen, it's all completely chicken soup.

NICK

It's what?

.

TOM

Kosher as Christmas

NICK
(rolls his eyes)
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.

TOM
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of 
sawn-off shotguns.

NICK
Bloody hell, Tom! This is a bit heavy. This is London, not the Lebanon' 
Who do you think I am?

TOM
I think you're Nick the Greek.

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY

There's a cacophony of seventies funk and football filling the room. We 
meet Rory Breaker. Rory is a very well-dressed cool-looking black dude. 
He is in his own way sophisticated, considering what he does for a 
living. His help, however, are less well-informed. Rory has Nick the 
Greek in front of him.

RORY
Nick, I don't have anything to do with weed, normally, but if it is 
what he says it is, I'll give him three and a half thousand a key, 
that's if it is what he says it is. I don't want to see it after a 
sample, I don't want to touch it after a sample. I'll leave you in the 
capable hands of Nathan here. He will work out the details, but let me 
get this straight. If the milk turns out to be sour, I ain't the kind 
of pussy who will drink it. Know what I mean?

74 ~ 75

INT. GARAGE UNDER THE ARCHES - DAY

The Scousers are handing over all the shotguns from their previous job 
to Barry and assistant. Dean has got a complicated hair arrangement to 
disguise his accident with the butler. Barry raises his eyebrows at 
this new look.

BARRY
Is your hair supposed to look like that, then?

Gary ignores this question.

DEAN
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are 
going back to post offices and cars.

BARRY
Where're the others?

Barry is looking with same concern for the hammer-lock Purdeys.

DEAN
There are no others.

BARRY
Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?

DEAN
I don't know what you mean.

BARRY
(dead serious)
There were two old guns there; where are they?

DEAN
Not in the cabinet there wasn't. There was a couple of old hammer-lock 
muskets the butler was carrying; they were ours, and we sold 'em!

77

BARRY
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.

DEAN
They were . . .

BARRY
(interrupts)
I am not fucking interested.

Shouting. If you don't want to end up counting the fingers that you 
haven't got, or sharing a bed with the anti-Christ, I suggest you get 
those guns, quick.

INT. BACK OF VAN - DAY

We are facing Nick's large behind, builder's cleavage poking out of the 
top of his trousers. Nick is unwrapping two long implements from a 
sheet: the hammer-lock Purdeys.

TOM
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you 
get them from?

NICK
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself 
or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired 
effect.

TOM
They look nice, I agree . . . but lacking in criminal credibility, 
aren't they? I might get laughed at. How much do you want for these 
muskets?

NICK
Seven hundred each.

78

TOM
What's that, a pound for every year they have been around? I know 
they're antiques, but I ain't paying antique prices. Pause.

And they're a bit long, aren't they?

NICK
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.

TOM
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but 
I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look 
fucking mean.

NICK
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.

TOM
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your 
weed man?

NICK
Rory Breaker is standing by. You stand to make a lot of money, Tommy 
boy.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

We are looking directly at JD's shell-shocked face. He gently lays down 
an empty glass on the bar.

HATCHET
I understand if this has come as a bit of a shock, but I'll tell you 
how this can be resolved by the good father.

* Big Chris in completed film.

Pause. The camera spins round to reveal Hatchet and Barry the Baptist.

JD
Go on.

HATCHET
I like your bar.

JD
Yes?

HATCHET
I want your bar.

JD
And?

HATCHET
Do you want me to draw a picture?

JD
Harry, that boy doesn't know his arsehole from his ear-hole, or you 
from a hoodwink. This bar is mine, and he has nothing to do with it.

HATCHET
What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of 
being able to sustain your son's life.

JD
And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But 
not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!

Barry pulls a kind of mock-scared face and clutches his heart.

80

HATCHET
Oh, careful JD, you'll give Barry a heart-attack.

We crash-zoom again into Harry's eyes to see the pupils contract. It's 
time to look mean.

I'll put that down to shock, but only once, only once can or will I let 
you get away with that. Your son's still got three days to find half a 
million, but make up your mind which one you prefer: your son, or your 
bar.

We have a slow-motion close-up of the drink being slammed down, proving 
a point.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON has rigged up an amplifier to the hole in the cupboard along with 
a ridiculous amount of recording equipment. The house lights still 
flicker on and off. We start the first part of the conversation looking 
at Bacon, who has his headphones on. We cut to Dog halfway through the 
second sentence.

INT. DOG'S HDUSE - DAY

PLANK
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

DOG
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this 
is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's 
not going to be easy.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON has a kettle next to where he is sitting. It steams away quite 
happily but a worrying noise starts to come from the plug socket. BACON 
prepares himself.- BOOM! He disappears into black.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

They react to the BOOM! Dog looks at the wall with suspicion, misses a 
beat, then continues.

DOG
What's that idiot doing next door?
(Points at Paul)
We use your van. It's up some stairs this place, so we'll stick out 
like balls on a bulldog. Plank is going up first. There is a cage but 
it is never locked, is it Plank?

PLANK
No.

DOG
And it better bloody not be. Once he is firmly in place, he gets the 
rest of us in. We'll get nasty with a couple of them, shit 'em up, 
scare and gag 'em. I can't see these wankers giving us a problem, but 
they might have a couple of tools hanging around like any cowboy. When 
the job is done we'll come straight back here. It's dark by then, 
unload and Robert's your father's brother. Everybody savvy?

ALL TOGETHER
Yup.

DOG
Right, tomorrow, eight o'clock we'll do it. Apparently these stags 
don't get out of bed till midday, lowest ebb and all that, and that's 
how I like it.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON is now lit by candle.

BACON
Jesus.

DOG
(off)
So no messing around tonight. We leave eight a.m., OK?

EDDY
Yes?

BACON
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

SOAP
(staggering)
Where did you get those from, a museum?

TOM
Nick the Greek.

BACON
How much did you part with?

TOM
Seven hundred for the pair.

SOAP
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They 
could do more harm than good.

BACON
Jesus, Tom, do they work?

TOM
I dunno, but they look nice. I rather like ' em.

EDDY
Top of the list of priorities, how nice they look.

SOAP
Ladies, if you don't mind, back to a more important issue. We've only 
got two real guns . . . apparently that's what they are. We find a good 
place to hide next door. When it sounds like the right time, we jack in 
the box, look nasty and stuff, cocoon them in gaffer tape, then we nick 
their van and swap the gear into a new van and then bring it back here. 
As long as we are all out of our hiding places quickly, it's the last 
thing they'll expect. If Tom and anyone else feels like kicking them 
around a bit I am sure it won't do any harm. A bit of pain never hurt 
any one (thinking about it) if you know what I mean . . . Also, I think 
knives are a good idea, you know, big fuck-off shiny knives, the ones 
that look like they could skin a crocodile. Knives are good because 
they don't make any noise, and the less noise the more we're likely to 
use them. That'll shit 'em up and make us look like pros.

There is a pause as they look at Soap with suspicion.

TOM
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?

BACON
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - MORNING

Ed and Bacon, etc, are all mounted up on top of one another looking out 
a crack in the curtain. They are observing Dog's party en route to 
work. They are dressed as kebab shop assistants.

SOAP
Where the fuck are they going? To butcher a sheep? I thought this was a 
robbery.

EDDY
Where did they get those outfits from? Haven't we got some like that, 
Tom?

TOM
Well, not exactly like that.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE (VAN) - MORNING

Dog and troop load up.

INT. SLDANES' SITTING ROOM - MORNING

Cut to Sloanes. They are up and unusually awake. Today is the day to 
move the money so they are comparatively alert. There is lots of 
activity.

WINSTON
You fucking jelly-heads, move it. You have been up for two hours, you 
should have got somewhere by now. The gear and the money has got to be 
out of here before twelve.

The horn blasts.

Who's that? J, don't you dare open the door until you use that cage. I 
am serious, and find out who it is first.

86

INT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY

J
(raising his voice for the door)
Hello, can I help you?

PLANK
All right, it's Plank. Is Willie there?

J
No, I'm afraid he's not. He's out at the moment.

PLANK
Well, perhaps you can help?

J
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.

PLANK
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?

J
I can't help you, Plank.

PLANK
I think you'll find it is in your interest.

INT SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

J
Hold on. OK.
(Whispering inside.)
Look Willie, it's Plank outside asking for you, he says it's in our 
interest.

87

WINSTON
I don't care if it's King fucking Kong, he is not coming in here, not 
today.

WILLIAM
Hold on: we are in business and correct me if I am wrong, but that is 
business?

J
Corrected; that's a walking accident that we can do without.

WILLIAM Jesus, he's OK; he knows only to buy weights now, so we are 
looking at least a couple of thou; just one last time.

J
What do you think, Winston?

Pause.

WINSTON
Willy, this is the last time, and don't let him know that you're here, 
otherwise he will be here all day, and get rid of him quick. We have 
work to do.

EXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY

DOG
(frustrated)
What the fuck is going on?

MICK
Do you want me to have a look, Dog?

DOG
No, you silly fucker, stay still.
(Whispering)
What's going on?

PLANK
Come on, I can't wait out here all day.

Starting to get anxious that the whole deal could be off Plank looks 
down the stairs and waves at Dog as some kind of reassurance.

J
(off)
All right, just coming.

J unlocks the door after getting the cage ready. There's an external 
door, and then a small corridor before the cage. J is inside the cage. 
Two, or at a push, three people could fit in this space before they 
would be poking out on the outside world.

INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY

PLANK
I thought you were going to leave me out there all day.

J
I didn't know you were a kebab man, Plank.

PLANK
(taking the piss)
Lives and learns doesn't one.

Then devastation slaps him hard.

Keep the gates locked now, do you?

J
Sorry, got to do business like this now; can't be too careful these 
days.

PLANK
I know.
(Suddenly turning very nasty whispering.)
Now shut it. You say a fucking word the right knee goes, another word 
then your left.

J
(confused and believing it's a joke, until he sees the gun.)
What are you doing, Plank?

PLANK
What do you think I am doing? Hold on. What are you doing? Unlock that 
gate. Oi! I said unlock that fucking gate.

J has found it all too much and has passed out with fear, collapsing on 
the floor in an awkward contorted position. Plank is desperately trying 
to find the right key. Things are not going as well as planned. Dog, in 
the meantime, has decided it's time to start the show

EXT. SLOANES' STAIRS - DAY

DOG
 Go! Go! Go! Fucking run, you two.

They all go charging into the open door only to slam straight into 
Plank. The keys go flying out of Plank's hands and through the cage. 
Plank cries with frustration, reaching out with his hand to retrieve 
them. Dog, finding the gate locked, is none too happy They are also 
still exposed to the eyes of the world due to the lack of space between 
the outside door and the inside cage.

90 ~ 91

INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY

DOG
(mesmerized}
The fucking gate's shut, you prick.

PLANK
Just hold on, I got the keys.

Having clawed them back with the end of his shotgun.

DOG
(seeing an unconscious man at his feet)
What the fuck did you do to Fauntleroy?

PLANK
(fumbling and panicking)
I didn't touch him, he just passed out.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

WINSTON
J, what's going on out there?
(Realising)
Get the rifle out, Charles. We're being fucked.

INT. SLOANES' FRONT DOOR - DAY

DOG
Get the sodding gate open now, Plank.

Plank is busy fumbling about, not really getting anywhere because of 
the pressure being applied.

PLANK
(trying to convince himself, as much as Dog)
It must be this one.

DOG
Just give me the keys.

The gun with which Plank has been entrusted is pointing straight at 
Dog's groin.

Point your gun in there, dick, not at me.

Mick has unwrapped his gun from his case. Dog turns and looks amazed at 
the size of the weapon.

What the fuck is that?

MICK
It's a bren gun.

DOG
You could have brought something a bit more fucking practical, couldn't 
ya?

Pop! We hear the sound of an air gun pellet hitting the bars.

PLANK
(trying to salvage some credibility)
Don't you stags move or I'll kill the lot of ya.

DOG
(amazed by this stupidity)
Who are you going to kill Plank? There's no one there.

We hear another pop and Plank gets shot in the neck. This 
understarulably sends him into a real panic, thinking this is curtains.

PLANK
(gurgle)
They shot me!

Panic unashamedly exposing itself. Trickles of blood start flowing from 
in-between Plank's fingers.

DOG
(unimpressed)
Well shoot them.

Plank shoots at everything and nothing. Smoke fills the corridor, 
leaving them in a cloud. A bit of coughing goes on, then silence.

JOHN
Jesus Plank, you could have got smokeless cartridges, I can't see a 
bloody thing.

Pop! Another pellet is fired hitting John in the chest.

Ah, Jesus, shit, I've been shot!

DOG
I don't fucking believe this. Could everybody stop getting shot. Sit 
down John, you cock, patch yourself up; it's only a fucking air rifle.

Dog is interrupted by an enormously loud blast of machine-gun fire. Dog 
and the boys panic, cover their ears and hit the floor. After this 
outburst Dog looks up at Mick and sees he is the culprit. Mick looks 
down at Dog expecting a congratulatory nod from Dog; he doesn't get it.

What the fuck was that?

MICK
That was the bren gun!

94 . ~ 95

DOG
If you use that again, you're a dead man, do you understand?

He speaks softly but he is quite shaken. He then raises his voice; he 
has had enough of all this mincing.

Right fellas!

He shouts to the Sloanes while dragging the semi-conscious body of J up 
to use as a shield.

Before I go any further I am going to shoot your mate's toes off!

No sooner said than done; his toes go. The smoke problem repeats itself 
and J faints again, but an unfazed Dog continues.

Now if you want us to be gone in two minutes, open the fucking gate, 
now!

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

CHARLES
He'll probably kill us if we do.

WINSTON
Well, J will certainly get it if we don't; he's serious. Look what he 
did to his toes.

DOG
(off)
Right, his leg's going now.

WINSTON
All right, all fucking right, I am coming.
(Turning and whispering)
Willie, he doesn't know you are here, just sort something out, OK.

Willie slinks off with a `like what?' look on his face.

INT. SLOANES' CAGE - DAY

DOG
And all your friends, there's a good lad.

WINSTON
There is only three of us here.

DOG
Do you want me to take his leg off? Where's the fourth?

WINSTON
I mean it, there is only three of us here.

DOG
Plank?

PLANK
(gurgle, gurgle)
Yeah, one of them's out.

DOG
OK, open the gate.

No sooner said than done. Dog hits one straight on Winston's forehead 
with the butt of his gun and drags him to the stairs. 97

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY DOG

Up boy, up, up.

They reach the top of the stairs.

Tie 'em up John and, Plank, you come with me. Where's the money?

PLANK
There, in those shoe boxes.

Dog opens them. There is nothing in them. If looks could kill Plank 
would be pushing up daisies.

DOG
(gun to the head of Winston)
Where?

WINSTON
Out the back.

DOG
And the weed?

WINSTON
Out the back.

MICK
Point.

WINSTON
With what?

MICK
Your hands, now!

WINSTON
I can't, I am tied up.

98

MICK
Well, well, shake your head or something.

DOG
All right Plank, get Paul out of the van.

This is done on a walky talky.

INT. SLOANES' BACK ROOM - DAY

The door opens. Willie is waiting behind it armed with a machete. He 
turns to his opponent and, eyes shut for Dutch courage, hacks straight 
into Mick's arm. Mick's machine gun goes off and William loses a finger 
as he tries to push the barrel to the side. He starts screaming 
uncontrollably

DOG
(to Plank)
Give us your knife.

Dog is going to put an end to this screaming and is making his way to 
its source. William is silenced through fear of the approaching Dog and 
slumps on the floor in a silenced wreck, holding a bleeding hand.

(the point of the blade resting on William's throat)
Enough! Mick, how you doing?

MICK
How do you think I am doing? He has fucking nearly chopped my arm off.

Dog's attention is diverted as he sees a table full of cash, neatly 
packed and stacked.

PAUL (in doorway visibly shocked
Gordon Bennett! What's been going on in here?

DOG
Shut up, you idiot. You got the bags? Can you get it in?

PAUL
There's a lot here, all right. I don't think we will be able to get 
this all in the van.

DOG
Bollocks, you'll get it in even if you have to do two trips.

EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - DAY

A traffic warden appears as Paul goes outside to load up.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will 
move it for you.

PAUL
I'll only be a minute.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
You've already been fifteen.

Paul, realising that persuasion is futile, decides other means are 
necessary to despatch this nuisance. He looks down both sides of the 
street: the coast is clear.

PAUL
Look. Go on, look.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
At what, exactly?

PAUL
My van is half full.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
So?

PAUL
So I've just got to put you in, and I am off.

Having made their way to the rear of the van, Paul opens the back 
doors. Paul smacks the traffic warden on the side of the head. The 
momentum carries the warden into the van, unconscious. Paul has another 
quick look round and Lifts the warden's legs up and pushes him deeper 
into the vehicle.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - DAY

PLANK
My neck, Dog.
(Dog shows no sign of pity)
That's the last bag?

DOG
(Turning to Mick.)
How about you? All right?

MICK
I'll be fine when; have dealt with this little shit. Mick grabs the 
machete that was used to disable him and puts down the machine gun.

DOG
Do it quietly.

Gloria, who has been forgotten by the Sloanes and unnoticed by Dog and 
troop, has sat through the whole episode without apparently realising 
the gravity of the situation. She is kick-started into action by the 
sure demise of Willie. The machine gun has been placed not too far away 
from her. She picks it up, and fires it into the already wounded body 
of Mick, who is almost instantaneously transformed into dog meat. 
Gloria, who has found a gear that nobody probably not even herself, 
knew existed, destroys everything she points at. Bodies jump for cover 
and Winston and the rest close their eyes and hope for the best. 
Eventually the gun, which seems to have a limitless supply of lead, 
goes quiet. We cut to close-ups of everybody opening their eyes 
cautiously. Looks of relief come from everyone, not least the Sloanes. 
Dog, who is closest, stands, walks straight up to her and punches her 
on the jaw Gloria is knocked out.

What was that? Where did she come from? That's fucking it. Tie her up. 
We are getting out of here.

EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON
Eh, bunk us up over the wall.

BACON forces one of the windows open. He looks pleased and beckons the 
others over. They keep in contact with Soap by cellular phones.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

EDDY
Everything all right out there, Tom?

TOM
(on phone)
Right as rain.

EDDY
Where the hell are we supposed to hide?

Ed looks into an almost empty room in which they are to find cover. He 
shrugs, and goes to sort himself out a cup of tea.

SOAP
What are you doing, Ed?

EDDY

Do you want one?

SOAP
No I fucking don't! You can't make a cup of tea, Edward.

EDDY
Why not? The whole of the British Empire was built on cups of tea.

SOAP
And look what happened to that.

EDDY
If you think I am going to war without one, you're mistaken, mate.

INT. DOG'S VAN - DAY

Dog turns to admire a full van.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
You won't get away with it.

Dog turns around and sees the tragic warden.

DOG
Paul, what's that?

PAUL
That's a traffic warden.

DOG
(looking straight at Paul)
What's he doing in the van?

Dog and the others look at the tragic warden mercilessly

PAUL
He was about to call the cozzers.

Paul hits him again, sending him back into unconsciousness.

DOG
We will deal with him later.

EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY Tom is on the mobile phone.

TOM
They're here.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog opens his door, enters the front room, dumps his two bags down and 
is met by a bleeding Plank (who is grunted at) and John, who is rubbing 
his chest. Dog sighs and turns to get more bags. The action starts. 
It's hard to tell who is who because of the balaclavas. The lads jump 
out of their positions.

BACON
Down, down, get fucking down now'

This is like d??vu. There is no response as the three of them seem 
not to believe what's going on. BACON hits Dog with the butt of his 
gun, establishing who's boss. Dog does down with a thud. Plank hits the 
floor immediately.

EXT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

Paul enters, sees trouble, drops his bags and prepares to run. He is 
met by Tom who greets him with a smash round the kneecaps with a lead 
pipe. This has more than the desired effect and Paul has to be dragged 
in screaming by Tom. It all went rather smoothly

EDDY
Tie 'em up, tape 'em up, face and mouth. Keys, I want the keys.

DOG
I'll find you.

BACON
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the 
keys without any trouble.

EDDY
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.

INT. DOG'S VAN - DAY

There is silence. For a few seconds all we can hear is the noise of 
their breathing.

107

TOM
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?

SOAP
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.

EDDY
Bacon, see what we got.

BACON
Let's have a butcher's. Jesus, there's lots of everything. We've got 
god knows how much of this stinking weed; we've got a shit load of 
cash; and we've got a . . . traffic warden.

TOM
A what?

BACON
A traffic warden. Look, what's this?

He holds up the hat.

TOM
Shit Ed, we've got a traffic warden.

Pause.

BACON
I think he's still alive. He's got claret coming out of him somewhere. 
What did they want with a traffic warden?

EDDY
I dunno, but I don't think we need him. Dump him at the lights.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

HATCHET
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is 
the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, 
Chris?

BIG CHRIS
No Harry, you can't.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog struggles free and unravels the tape from his head and gets the 
other three out.

DOG
Dead. Dead. I don't know who they think they could be, for me not to 
find 'em. Of course I'll find 'em. I don't give a flying fucking fish 
who they think they are. I'll kill - fur and feathers, burning wheel 
South African style, kebab 'em, peel 'em, slice 'em and dice ' em, hang 
draw and fucking quarter ' em.

INT. OTHER VAN - NIGHT

Two vans are parked back to back. We see Ed and the boys putting one 
last trunk into the back of the new van.

EDDY
That's it all done, we are off.

SOAP
You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?

EDDY
There is nowhere else to keep it, and it's the last place they are 
going to look. Anyway the battle's over and the war is won.

Ed passes a handful of grass to Tom.

Tom, take this to Nick, and let's get rid of it, quick.

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Nick has given the weed to Rory for inspection. Lenny has stepped in.

LENNY
It is skunk . . . and it's as good as it gets.

RORY
OK, I'll take it off you; half price.

NICK
I don't think he'll like that. You said three-five a key, that's what 
he wants and you know that's a good price.

RORY BREAKER
It was yesterday I said three and a half grand and today is today, if I 
am not mistaken.

Turns back to the TV.

I'll take it tomorrow for half price. If he wants to move it quick 
he'll take it. Now, I've got another game coming up in a minute so if 
you would be kind enough.

Pointing at the door. Nick exits.

Lenny, take this to Snow White and the three little chemists; they 
should have a gander at this. I want a proper opinion. 110

EXT. SLOANES' HOUSE - NIGHT

Lenny and Nathan, Rory's minders, pull up outside the Sloanes' house to 
have the weed analysed. For the first time it is revealed that Rory 
Breaker owns the Sloanes.

LENNY
Hold on!

NATHAN
What?

LENNY
something's not quite right here. Go in slowly, Nathan.

NATHAN
Fuck you funny man, you go first.

INT. SLOANES' SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

NATHAN
Shit!

Winston is tied up and squirming.

WINSTON
For Christ's sake, get us out.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

EDDY
Well, not a bad day's work. That takes care of Harry.

Pushing a massive pile of notes to one side.

SOAP
What's left over?'

TOM
Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.

SOAP
What about all the gear?

BACON
'Ere, have a pull of this.

Passes Ed the joint.

EDDY
I don't want that horrible shit. Give it to Soap. Can we just lock up 
and get drunk now, please?

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

We see Winston, Nathan and the torso of Lenny, standing in front of 
Rory Like naughty schoolchildren.

WINSTON
We had the gates up but they stuck a shotgun through. Poor bloody J got 
shot; it was a right mess.

The gravity and reality dawns on Rory.

RORY
It will cost you more than your life's worth if you jest with me.

LENNY
Some girl took one of 'em out, but he's a bit of a mess.

WINSTON
(proudly j
We shot one of them in the throat.

112

RORY
What do you want, a fucking medal? I'll shoot you in the fucking throat 
if I don't get the gear back.

He pauses, rubs his forehead and continues, slightly calmer. You shot 
the one that's in there now?

WINSTON

No, another one.

RORY
This is more like it. So where's he?

WINSTON
They took him with them; he was still alive.

RORY
Well, what did you shoot him with, an air gun?

There is an embarrassed pause and a look of `how did you know?' Rory 
doesn't need an answer and slaps his forehead.

WINSTON
We grow weed, we're not mercenaries.

RORY

You don't say.

There is a pause while Rory searches for the right words. The silence 
is deafening.

LENNY
(stupidly)
Who could it be? Where do we start, Rory?

Rory looks up amazed.

RORY
Mr Breaker! Today my name is Mr Breaker. You think_this is a 
coincidence? Not many, Benny! This white shite steals my goods and then 
thinks it is a good idea to sell it back to me. They got less brains 
than you, Lenny . . . Get Nick cum-bubble round here now if he is 
stupid enough to still be on this planet.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dog has all his boys round.

DOG
I want you to search the house for bugs. I mean I want you to strip it.

JOHN
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken 
it with 'em.

DOG
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and 
that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you 
to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. 
I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you 
responsible.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

All kinds of characters have made an appearance. A game of cards is in 
motion, the forfeit now being alcohol. Barfly Jack the barman is 
sitting at the table. They are already on the road to being comfortably 
comatose.

TOM
Rory Breaker?

114

BARFLY JACK
Yeah, I know Rory.

This next section is subtitled. This is to keep everyone, even those 
familiar with cockney rhyming slang up to speed with the narration, of 
which even Tom is unsure. As with the police scene earlier this is a 
voice-over and we cut to the relevant scenes.

BARFLYJACK
(voice-over)
Rory's got few interests in life; darky music, football, bees and honey 
and kicking the shit out of anyone that interferes with that shortlist. 
A few nights ago Rory's Roger iron rusted, so he has gone to the 
battle-cruiser to watch the end of a football game. Nobody is watching 
the custard so he has turned the channel over. A fat man's north opens 
and he wanders up and turns the Liza over. `Now fuck off and watch it 
somewhere else.' Rory knows claret is imminent, but he doesn't want to 
miss the end of the game; so, calm as a coma, he stands and picks up a 
fire extinguisher and he walks straight past the jam rolls who are 
ready for action, then he plonks it outside the entrance. He then 
orders an Aristotle of the most ping pong oddly in the nuclear sub and 
switches back to his footer. `That's fucking it,' says the man. Rory 
gobs out a mouthful of booze covering fatty; he flicks a flaming match 
into his bird's nest and the man lit up like a leaking gas pipe. Rory, 
unfazed, turned back to watch his game. The flaming man and his chinos 
ran outside to extinguish the flames, and Rory cheered on. His team won 
too, four-nil.

EXT.JD'S BAR - NIGHT

After a while Ed sees Daisy making a sneaky sharp exit and tries to 
pursue her, running out on to the street. Daisy is nowhere to be seen.

115

INT. RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY

Nick is blissfully ignorant of the situation. He is sitting in front of 
Rory.

RORY
Your one saving grace might be your stupidity.

NICK
(looking quite petrified)
Er.

RORY
Don't fucking er me, Greek boy! How is it that your so-fucking-stupid, 
soon-to-be-dead friends thought they might be able to steal my gear? 
And then sell it back to me? Is this a declaration of war? Is this some 
sort of white cunts' joke that black cunts don't get? 'Cos I am not 
fucking laughing, Nik-ol-as.

NICK
Er.

RORY
There are four interests I have, Nick. Football, music, money, and the 
annihilation of anybody who interferes with that shortlist . . . I know 
you couldn't have known my position because you're not so fucking 
stupid that if you did know, you would turn up here scratching your 
arse, with that `what's going on here' look slapped on your Chevy 
Chase. But what you do know is where these people live.

We look at the white faced Nick. He doesn't open his mouth. The penny 
has dropped.

If you hold anything back, I'll kill you. If you bend the truth, or if 
I think you're bending the truth, I'll kill you. If you forget 
anything, I'll kill you. In fact, you're going to have to work very 
hard to stay alive, Nick. I hope you understand everything

I have said. Because if you don't, I'll kill you. Now, Mr Bubble and 
Squeak. You may now enlighten me.

INT. DOG'S HOUSE - MORNING

Paul, John, and Plank are lined up like naughty schoolchildren in front 
of Dog, who is black-eyed and pissed off:

DOG
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?

JOHN
Er well, yes we do.

DOG
In fact it is a little more than a bit of a problem, isn't it? You 
could say that in the scale of these things this is the Mount fucking 
Everest of problems, couldn't you? . . . And the reason it is such a 
mon fucking-strosity of a problem is because you don't have the first 
fucking idea who did this to us, do you?

PLANK
Dog, we have been up all night. It's no one round here! We have had 
them all against the wall.

JOHN
If it was a toe rag from the area we would know.

Dog starts slapping his troops round their heads.

DOG
You wouldn't know if it was the next-door fucking neighbours, you 
prick! You find 'em, you hear? And find 'em quick! Now get out and 
start looking! Out! Out!

Dog Loses his temper and throws Plank across the room. Plank's head 
breaks effortlessIy through the wall.

INT. ED AND BACON'S CUPBOARD - MORNING

A dust-covered Plank blinks in confusion as he looks on to a heap of 
recording equipment.

INT. JD'S BAR - DAY

Recovering from the night before.

BACON
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug 
deal, you watch Scarface!

EDDY
That inspires confidence, that does.

TOM
This guy Rory Breaker can afford to do the deal at the price we are 
selling. It's not worth him giving us trouble; he knows we would be a 
pain in the arse, and who wants a pain in the arse?

SOAP
I would take a pain in the arse for half a million.

TOM
You would take a pain ? the arse full stop.

SOAP
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.

EDDY
Jesus, would you two stop flirting for one minute . . . After we pay 
Hatchet, this deal puts us up near enough two hundred grand each. Not 
bad for a day's work, I think you will agree.

118

INT. SPLTT SCREEN. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY

A seventies-style split screen. A very shaky Nick answers his cartoon 
telephone.

NICK
Yeah?

INT. DEAN'S HOUSE - DAY

DEAN
That's no way to answer the phone.

NICK
Is that you, Dean?

DEAN
Sure is.

NICK
What can I do for you?

DEAN
You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.

NICK
Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.

DEAN
I got the money to pay for 'em.

NICK
I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to 
see them or the guns again.

Gary looks at Dean.

119

DEAN
If we can't get 'em, we can't get 'em.

INT. SPLIT SCREEN. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY. Barry is on his 
mobile, moments later.

BARRY
You fucking well have to get 'em!

INT. DEAN'S - DAY

DEAN
We made a deal for everything inside the cabinet.

BARRY
Inside, out-fuckin'-side. I don't give a shit, you get those guns 
because if you don't . . .

DEAN
Yeah, Bazza, what?

BARRY
You heard of Harry Lonsdale? Otherwise known as Back-you-up with-a-
Hatchet Harry, infamous for his removal of digits?

Dean pauses for a while, a look of concern coming over his face.

Well this is `James Bond need to know' time. They're his! When you 
dance with the devil you wait for the song to stop, know what I mean?

Hatchet has had enough. He grabs the phone from Barry's hand, waving 
the infamous fifteen-inch big black cock in the other hand. Hatchet 
goes on to put the shits up the Scousers.

HATCHET
Do you know who I am? I am split in two; there is me, and there is my 
patience, and patience has gone to the hospital; you are not far 
behind, know what I mean? I mean, find ' em, torture 'em, kill 'em, and 
bring back what belongs to me, because if you don't . . . you are . . . 
bang . . . in trouble.

Hatchet slams the phone down. Dean looks at Gary in horror.

GARY
Who was that?

DEAN
That was Hatchet Horrible Harry.

GARY
Jesus, I have heard about him.

DEAN
We're in the spite. They were his fucking guns that we sold; we gotta 
find 'em.

Dean dials Nick immediately.

No fucking about, Nick; where can I find those guns?

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog and boys have made a Large hole in the connecting cupboard wall 
which they have crawled through. Dog is holding a large bag which he 
has found.

JOHN
Dog, I have found the cash!

DOG
The stupid bastards! Count it!

JOHN
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?

DOG
We're not going next door until we've flayed these dead men walking. 
Count it out the back. I don't want them seeing you fingering that 
money as soon as they walk in.

JOHN
But...
(interrupts)
Give it us here, you dozy sod. You hide and get the guns ready. Wait 
until they are well in, then give it to 'em.

INT RORY BREAKER'S OFFICE - DAY

Rory Breaker is amassing his troops and preparing to go round to Ed's.

RORY BREAKER
We are going to do a proper decoration job. I want the grey skies of 
London illuminated; I want that house painted red. Winston here is 
coming along, see if he can recognize any of 'em, then we bring what's 
mine back here. Watch out for these fellas; they've got a bit of 
arsenal and they don't mind using it. Now you know what you're doing, 
yes?

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Big Chris and Little Chris are waiting outside. Dog's gang are waiting 
for Ed's gang inside. Rory's gang are going to Ed's.

122

INT. RORY BREAKER'S VAN - DAY

Six heavy-looking black guys are loading their weapons.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Dog's gang are also loading their weapons and concealing themselves 
among the furniture. Dog is counting out the money in the side room and 
has the two antique hammer-lock shotguns resting on the table in front 
of him, which were found with the rest of the bounty.

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Rory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door. 
The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with 
gun) prepares to do his worst.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

There is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a 
large black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be 
at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as 
both gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the 
machine gun to explore further.

PLANK
(under his breath)
What the fuck is going on here?

Dog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into 
their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use 
them. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see 
numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't 
take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.'

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

We see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through.

INT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY

Dog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than 
aware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his 
suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, 
gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then 
checks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks 
quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and 
is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit.

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Big Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the 
activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks 
straight into him.

BIG CHRIS
Got something here for me, have ya?
(Dog is stunned by this)
Come on, chop chop.

Before Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each 
hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing 
what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of 
money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much.

On reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on 
the back seat.

Count that son, and put your seatbelt on.

INT. SCOUSERS' CAR - DAY

DEAN
Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns.

INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

Ed's place has been shot to pieces. Only Rory and Winston (in shock) 
seem to be left. Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his 
van, then he kicks over one of the bodies. It's a blood-covered Plank.

RORY BREAKER
This is one of them.

Winston nods in confirmation.

Lucky, that.

Bang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and 
Plank despatch each other simultaneously.

INT. ED'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Tom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving. 126

TOM
There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks 
have they got between them?

SOAP
Six.

TOM
How many wings have they got between them?

SOAP
Twelve.

TOM
How many feet?

SOAP
Er, well, twelve.

TOM
That's right. So how many whiskers has the little white kitten got?

SOAP
How the fuck should I know?

TOM
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white 
pussy?]

The end of this joke is interrupted by a van swerving past them, 
dangerously close. The lads lodge a complaint and then they stop 
outside Ed and Bacon's so that they can pick up the money.

* Cut from completed film.

127

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY

BACON
What has been going on here?

They look into a smoking, blood-covered house.

SOAP
The money, the gear!

TOM
That's fucked it. What do we do now? No money, no weed; it's all been 
swapped for a pile of corpses.

SOAP
OK, don't panic; let's think about this.

EDDY
Bollocks! You can think about it for as long as you like. I am 
panicking and I am off mate.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

Big Chris is about to walk in to Hatchet's office. The door opens and 
out walks John O'Driscoll with a serious sunburn.

BIG CHRIS
Hello, John. Nice holiday?

JOHN O'DRISCOLL
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.

BIG CHRIS
I am sure you have, no one was accusing you of being dishonest, John.

128

HATCHET
(off)
That you, Chris?

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

HATCHET
How did you get your hands on these?

He drops a vagina-shaped penis massager, realising that these are the 
guns he has been after. He then tries desperately to conceal his 
excitement.

BIG CHRIS
The boys had 'em. I know you like these things; wondered if you wanted 
them?

HATCHET
Er, yeah, sure, I'll have 'em.

BARRY
Was it any trouble getting the money?

BIG CHRIS
Well, not especially, but they seem to of upset a few characters.

HATCHET
Have you counted the money?

BIG CHRIS
Yeah, it's all there, to the pound.

HATCHET
They were going to pay, then?

BIG CHRIS
It looks like ?, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my 
experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.

HATCHET
Good job, Chris.

Chris exits, pushing his wages into his inside packet. Harry is 
ecstatic about the guns and starts chuckling to himself.

EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Scousers watch Big Chris walk out of Hatchet's empty-handed

DEAN
We gotta get those guns.

GARY
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.

DEAN
Listen, I don't care who lives in there; all as I know it's got to be 
preferable to death by Hatchet.

GARY
Furry muff, let's go.

EXT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) - DAY

SOAP
I hope this is the right move.

EDDY
It's either that, my old boy's place, and we lose a digit daily. I am 
going to call him.

BACON
As if he'll care.

130

EDDY
He'll care all right. That was going to be his money. Whether he cares 
about us is different. Pass your phone.

BACON
Think about what you're going to say, Ed; we are on thin ice.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S STAIRCASE - DAY

The two Scousers with guns in hand creep their way up the stairs. 
There's only one door in front of them. Dean gets ready to kick it 
open. Gary leans against the wall and delivers a Professionals-style 
kick.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Harry is in his offtce playing with his guns. The phone rings.

HATCHET
That you, boy?

EDDY
(on phone)
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.

HATCHET
It's pay day, ain't it?

EDDY
(on phone)
I wanted to talk to you about that.

HATCHET
I bet you did. I have got half a million nicker sitting in front of me, 
which means that some poor sod doesn't. You must have upset a few 
people, boy . . . but that isn't really my concern, is it? But what 
does concern me is the guns you had. I want to talk to you about that. 
Get your arse over here now, and I do mean now!

INT. ED'S CAR - DAY

Ed puts the phone down after a pause. His state of shock is obvious to 
the rest of the lads.

BACON
Well?

EDDY
Well what?

TOM
(impatiently)
Well, what did he say?

EDDY
He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those 
guns . . . now.

SOAP
You what? What are you on about?

EDDY
Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we 
should go and see him.

BACON
I think you're a sandwich short of a picnic, mate; you want to start

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

We cut to a time Lapse. Hatchet puts down the phone while resting his 
bum on the front of his desk. He is ecstatic with the guns. He loads 
and plays with them, aiming at imaginary moving birds.

The door is suddenly kicked wide open and, lo and behold, there is a 
Scouser standing in the door. Dean has a thousand ugly thoughts flying 
through his troubled mind, most of which are based an regretting the 
decision to kick this door in: `shit, what the hell is that, and why is 
he holding a shotgun'. Hatchet realizes that the man standing in the 
doorway (who is posed like De Niro in the poster of Taxi Driver, 
holding a gun in each hand) has nor come to deliver the mail. The pair 
are blissfully unaware that employee has met employer. Hatchet Harry 
has effectively contracted his own demise. The pause is eventually 
shattered by reality There is a rush to pull their individual triggers. 
There is a race between the two bullets to reach their prospective 
targets. Both barrels are emptied into Dean's chest. The Scourer is 
airborne by the sheer power of the cartridges. One of Dean's 
bullets,finds its way into Harry's shoulder. Gary can do nothing to 
stop this atrocity. He watches helplessly as his pal flies clean past 
him.

Overtaken by emotion or fear, Gary charges in, gun blazing, and 
proceeds to perforate Hatchet who is now unarmed. Hatchet flies over 
his desk. Gary comes into the room to finish the job and fires one last 
bullet into Hatchet, who is lying on the chair side of his desk. It is 
then revealed that Barry is sitting in his chair behind the door. The 
Scourer can't see Barry and Barry can't see Gary's face. Barry throws 
the hatchet that is sitting next to him in a butcher's block. It hits 
Gary in the back. Gary spins round firing wildly and lodges a bullet in 
Barry's stomach. It is then clear to them both that this has all been a 
terrible mistake.

BARRY/GARY
What are you doing here?

Then both collapse into dead lumps on the floor.

EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE ED'S CAR - DAY

EDDY
You and me, Tom.

TOM
What do you mean, me?

They stand outside Hatchet's door and are just about to ring it when 
Tom notices it's open.

INT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY EDDY

Oh Jesus, not again.

The two pause while they build their confidence. They enter Hatchet 
Harry's room. It's still smoky. There on the table is the money.

TOM
That's it, I am off.

Ed tiptoes over to the bag containing the money.

EDDY
Tom, this is our case.

TOM
. . . What?

EDDY
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.

Tom sees his guns. His eyes widen in surprise.

TOM
I'll meet you in the car. I am taking these guns.

136

EDDY
Tom, don't mess around, let's go.

TOM
I'11 meet you in the car.

EDDY
Tom?

TOM
I'll only be a minute.

EXT. HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE/CHRIS'S CAR - DAY

BIG CHRIS
A job well done son; we made a few quid out of that one.

As he puts the key in the ignition, there is no reply from his little 
boy

BIG CHRIS
Son?

DOG
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?

We can't see Dog but we can see the sharp side of a knife resting along 
the front of Little Chris's throat. The Dog is Lying down in the back. 
Big Chris assesses the situation.

BIG CHRIS
You all right back there, mate?

DOG
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?

BIG CHRIS
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137

DOG
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want 
to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.

BIG CHRIS
All right, furry muff.

Big Chris doesn't seem too bothered by this problem. He shrugs and 
starts the car.

DOG
What are you doing?

BIG CHRIS
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.

DOG
You had better be careful.

Big Chris starts his car up, looks across to make sure that Little 
Chris has got his seatbelt on and pulls out on to the road. He gets 
faster and faster until Dog pokes him in the shoulder with his knife. 
Chris pulls hard to the left and rams into the nearest parked vehicle. 
BANG' Dog goes flying forward, hitting the windscreen.

INT. ED'S CAR (STATIC) OUTSIDE HATCHET HARRY'S OFFICE - DAY

Another time lapse.

SOAP
Well, what's going on?

EDDY
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which 
means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more 
problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they 
are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything 
wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.

Bang! Big Chris's car hits them straight in the rear. The bag of cash 
goes flying through the car, landing on the dash. The lads are knocked 
unconscious.

INT. CHRIS'S CAR (NOW STATIC) - DAY

Big Chris, having removed the knife from a stunned Dog, proceeds to 
smash his head against the dash and has the most amount of fun in doing 
so.

BIG CHRIS
Never, never, not as long as I can remember has anybody been as rude to 
me as you have.

Dog is being thrown around like a rag doll.

INT. SIDE ROOM TO INTERROGATION ROOM - PRESENT, OPENING SCENE

We are looking through a two-way mirror.

SERG
Don't think I wouldn't like to get rid of you; but before I do, I need 
to know what's going on, Edward.

EDDY
If you think you're in the dark, I am in a black hole, blindfolded.

The camera spins round to see the traffic warden standing with a 
policeman. There is a long pause far consideration. Eventually he 
shakes his head.

TRAFFIC WARDEN
No, that's not one of them.

The policeman then knocks on the door.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

The SERG looks round to see the policeman. They exit and Ed is left on 
his own. After a short pause the door bursts open.

SERG
All right son, you're outta here! And you want to stay outta here.

FADE IN TO BLACK.

FADE IN.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

All the lads are sitting in the bar. Ed is talking to Tom who is 
interested in whatever he has to say.

EDDY
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so 
that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because 
there is no evidence against us.

BACON
Apart from those shotguns.

EDDY
And Tom took care of them.

Pause while Tom looks embarrassed about something.

SOAP
You did take care of the guns, didn't you, Tom?

Ed looks at Tom, who looks even more embarrassed.

TOM
I wanted to talk to you about that.

BACON
Well, talk.

TOM
Well not exactly, no; I got 'em sitting in the car, actually; I thought 
we might sell them back to the Greek, but I am having a bit of a 
problem getting hold of him.

BACON

You dippy bastard.

EDDY
The only item that connects us with the crime is sitting in your car 
which is sitting outside?

TOM
We paid seven hundred quid for those guns. They could hardly trace them 
to you, could they?

SOAP
I don't think we will take the risk for seven hundred quid.

EDDY
Tom, go and throw those guns off a bridge.

BACON
And, throw yourself off while you're at it. SOAP

Now, Tom! There is a pause.

ALTOGETHER
Now, Tom!

Tom leaves, looking a little sulky.

EDDY
The silly sod.

Big Chris walks in. He approaches the bar.

BIG CHRIS
JD.

JD
Chris.
(Pause)
You come to collect something, Chris? Should I have something for you?

BIG CHRIS
Nope.

JD
Can I help?

BIG CHRIS
I think I can help you, as it happens.

JD
Yes?

BIG CHRIS
I have got something for ya. Well, for your boy, actually.

JD
Well, I suggest you speak to him, then.

They all look rather shocked. He is carrying their bag and he places it 
on the table, which increases the shock factor.

BIG CHRIS
It seems that Hatchet under-estimated your lot and that seems to have 
cost him . . . I am not going to make the same mistake, am I? I have 
decided to bring your bag back.

Pause. The words you are looking for start with thank you.

EDDY
Thank you.

BIG CHRIS
Now you have presented me with a problem. I don't have an employer any 
more. So I have taken care of myself and my son, and if you think that 
is unfair you just come and pay me a little visit; but you better be 
waving the white flag high and clear, otherwise it will be the last 
little visit you lot ever make . . . That's all I had to say. It's been 
emotional.

Big Chris turns to walk out. The lads stare at the bag and then at each 
other.

EXT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Big Chris walks out into the street. We see a shiny new sports car. 
Little Chris is sitting in the passenger seat.

BIG CHRIS
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money-
loaning business, all right, son?

LITTLE CHRIS
All right, Dad.

BIG CHRIS
Well, put your seatbelt on then.

INT. JD'S BAR - NIGHT

Ed goes forward to open the case. The rest are still in shock. Ed opens 
the bag.

EDDY
There's nothing in it!

SOAP
What do you mean?

EDDY
I mean it's fucking empty.

BACON  lunges forward and stares in. He sticks his hand in and extracts 
an A4 envelope. They look puzzled. Ed feels the package and starts to 
tear the top off. As this is done it creates a split screen.

On the other side of the picture, Tom is on a London bridge with the 
car boot open. He looks at the guns with regret and give them one last 
polish. Then he folds the guns up and places them on top of a handrail. 
Simultaneously Ed extracts a Sotherby's brochure on shotguns. They 
still look confused. They turn the brochure upside down and recognize 
the shotguns. Slowly they start to turn the pages.

Torn pushes the shotguns over the top rail: they fall. He starts 
walking but stops for some reason. He retreads his steps and peers 
over; the guns had just fallen on to a shelf.

Ed sees the price of the guns: a series of alarming zooms cut between 
eyes and prices. They panic and reach for their mobile phones.

Tom is climbing over the bridge now and has to hold on to the rail with 
one arm.

Ed starts screaming at the other two that the number is engaged and 
asks them to put their phones down.

Tom now had one hand on the guns and one on the rail. His mobile phone 
starts to ring in his top pocket; he has either to drop the guns or let 
go of the rail to answer the phone.

The shot freezes.

               We hear the sound of a plane landing over black.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               POV from a car window - the colors and lights of Tokyo neon 
               at night blur by.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the backseat of a Presidential limousine, BOB (late-
               forties), tired and depressed, leans against a little doily, 
               staring out the window.

               P.O.V. from car window- We see buildings covered in bright 
               signs, a billboard of Brad Pitt selling jeans, another of 
               Bob in black & white,looking distinguished with a bottle of 
               whiskey in a Suntory ad... more signs, a huge TV with perky 
               Japanese pop stars singing.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob's black Presidential (looks like a 60's diplomat's car) 
               pulls up at the entrance of the Park Hyatt, a modern sky 
               rise.

               The automatic doors open on the car, as Bob gets out.   Eager 
               BELLHOPS with white gloves approach at the sight of the car, 
               welcoming Bob and helping him with his bags.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               Bob stands in the back of a crowded elevator surrounded by 
               Japanese businessmen below his shoulders.

               The elevator stops at the 50th floor and the doors open onto

               the massive, streamline lobby of the Park Hyatt.

               Bob follows the JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN out into the marble and 
               glass lobby that frames the view of Tokyo.

               The CONCIERGE and several eager HOTEL MANAGERS greet Bob. He 
               just wants to sleep, but more STAFF continue to greet him, 
               ask him about his fright. They lead him to reception.

               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT

               At the reception area four JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN and two WOMEN 
               quickly sit up from their seats on sight of Bob, and extend 
               handshakes and gifts. They bow and introduce themselves from 
               the commercial company, extend name cards and welcome him 
               enthusiastically.

               More staff welcomes him and offer their service during his 
               stay.

               One of them presents a fax that has come for him.

               INSERT -

               "TO: BOB HARRIS

               FROM: LYDIA HARRIS

               YOU FORGOT ADAM'S BIRTHDAY.

               I'M SURE HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

               HAVE A GOOD TRIP, L"

               He doesn't know what to do with it, and stuffs it in his 
               pocket.

               The commercial people tell him when they'll be picking him 
               up, and ask if he needs anything else.

               Some JAPANESE ROCK STARS with shag haircuts and skinny leather 
               pants pass by. Each commercial person has to shake Bob's 
               hand before leaving.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob sits on the end of the bed in a too small hotel kimono.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob sits at the bar. A few minutes pass as he sits in silence 
               looking around, drinking a scotch.  Chet Baker sings "The 
               Thrill is Gone" over the stereo.

               We see Bob's POV of tables of people talking. JAPANESE WOMEN 
               SMOKING, AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN tying one on, talking about 
               software sales. A WAITER carefully setting down a coaster, 
               and pouring a beer very, very slowly. It's all very foreign.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               The automatic hotel curtains open, pouring light into the 
               room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

               Bob gets in the shower overlooking the view of Tokyo. The 
               shower head is at his elbows, he raises it as high as it 
               goes, and leans down to have a shower. This hotel was not 
               designed with him in mind.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STUDIO - DAY

               Whiskey commercial shoot.

               The set is full of activity as the JAPANESE CREW work. Bob, 
               in a shawl collared tuxedo sits at a European style bar set 
               with a cut crystal glass of whiskey. A JAPANESE GIRL quickly 
               powders his face as they adjust lights and the DIRECTOR and 
               crew speak in hurried Japanese.

               The Director (with blue contact lenses) says a few long 
               sentences in Japanese.

               TRANSLATOR, a middle-aged woman in a coordinated outfit, 
               translates but it is only a short sentence now.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         He wants you to turn, look in camera 
                         and say the lines.

               Bob wonders what she's leaving out, or if that's the way it 
               works from Japanese to English.

                                     BOB
                         That's all he said?

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Yes, turn to camera.

               Bob thinks let's just get it over with.

                                     BOB
                         Turn left or right?

               The Translator blots her face with a tissue, and asks the 
               director in a Japanese sentence 5 times as long. The Director 
               answers her in a long excited phrase.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Right side. And with intensity.

                                     BOB
                         Is that everything? It seemed like 
                         he was saying a lot more.

               The excited Director says more in Japanese. Translator nods 
               in understanding. Bob doesn't really know what's going on.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Like an old friend, and into the 
                         camera.

                                     DIRECTOR
                              (to Bob))
                         Suntory Time!

               They get ready, and roll camera:

               Bob turns and looks suavely to the camera:

                                     BOB
                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

               The Director yells something about ten sentences long. The 
               translator nods.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         Could you do it slower, and with 
                         more intensity?

                                     BOB
                         Okay.

               The Translator answers for him in four sentences.

               ON THE MONITOR - we see the next take: the moody lighting 
               shines on Bob, the camera gets closer as he stares into camera 
               and gives them the line.

                                     BOB
                         For relaxing times, make it Suntory 
                         Time.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Tall glass walls show the neon and high-rises of the city.

               A sad and romantic Bill Evans song plays. Bob sits alone 
               with a scotch at the bar.

               Some drunk AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN, with their ties thrown over 
               their shoulders recognize him.

                         Yeah, I love Sunset  Odds! BOB Oh, 
                         Ok, thanks.

                                     BUSINESS GUY
                         Man, that car chase-

               Bob  nods.

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob comes back to his room. The maids have left everything 
               perfect, his beige bed is turned down, and the TV has been 
               left on to a channel playing a montage of flower close-ups 
               in nature while sad violin music plays. It's supposed to be 
               relaxing, but it's just sad.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob lies in bed. He flips through TV channels from the remote 
               control.  He passes a Japanese game show, to an 80s Cannon 
               Ball run-type movie with him in it dubbed into Japanese. He 
               turns it off as he hears a knock at the door.

               He goes to the door, and opens it part way.

                                     WOMAN (O.C.)
                              (Raspy Japanese voice)
                         Mr. Harris?

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Mr. Kazuzo sent me.

                                     BOB
                         Oh?

                                     WOMAN
                         Can I enter?

               He pauses, then opens the door.

               A WOMAN in her forties in a short tight leather mini skirt 
               and stockings comes in. She is wearing '60s style make-up.

               Bob sits on the bed not sure what to do as he watches her.

               Bob's POV - We see her back to us as she puts a CD on the 
               stereo - it begins to play: Serge Gainsberg and Brigitte 
               Bardot sing "Bonnie & Clyde".  The woman turns slyly around 
               and shimmies over to Bob.

                                     WOMAN
                              (as she tries to 
                              undress him)
                         Mr. Harris?

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Do you like massage?

                                     BOB
                         I don't think so.

                                     WOMAN
                         Mr. Kazuzo send Premium Fantasy.

               She pushes him back onto the bed. He hesitates, but then 
               goes along with it passively.

                                     WOMAN
                         My stockings.

                                     BOB
                         Yes?

                                     WOMAN
                         Take them.

               He fumbles with her stockings, trying to do as she says.

                                     WOMAN
                         No - Lip  them... Don't touch me!

               He takes his hands back confused.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lip my stockings! 

               He backs away, as he tries to understand her.

                                     WOMAN
                         Lip them! 

               She throws her leg up to him on the bed.

                                     BOB
                         Huh?

               She pantomimes ripping them. He finally understands.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, you want me to rip them?

               He pulls at her stockings trying to rip them, but they just 
               snap.

               She pretends to struggle.

                                     WOMAN
                         Please let me go!

               He pulls his hands away. She grabs them and puts them back 
               on her, and keeps struggling dramatically. They wrestle around 
               awkwardly, her pretending to try to get away, but not letting 
               him go. She rips her stockings and falls off the bed in fake-
               defense.

                                     WOMAN
                         Let me go! 

               She pulls a confused Bob down on top of her. He doesn't know 
               what she wants.

               She rips another stocking and pins him on the ground. He 
               tries to crawl away, she grabs his leg and trips him. He 
               grabs a nearby table leg as he falls, the lamp crashes to 
               the floor, the room goes black.

                                     BOB
                         I think you should leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               In the harsh sunlight of the big windows Bob eats breakfast 
               alone. Next to him is a table of TEXANS in cowboy hats. At 
               another table a JAPANESE COUPLE in sunglasses chain smoke 
               and drink coffee.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

               Bob gets into the ded elevator. He is stopped momentarily by 
               the Concierge who asks him if everything is fine for his 
               stay.

               In the elevator Bob's surrounded by JAPANESE BUSINESSPEOPLE 
               and a FAMILY dressed for a wedding.

               Across, at the other side of the elevator he sees CHARLOTTE, 
               a pretty Ivy-league girl in her mid-twenties, and the only 
               other Westerner in the elevator. Her honey-colored hair stands 
               out in the crowd.

               She's looking at him like you do when someone new comes in 
               the elevator, but the Japanese look straight ahead at the 
               elevator doors.

               Charlotte and Bob look at each other across the Japanese 
               heads. She smiles, from one foreigner to another. The door 
               opens and she gets out with the crowd. Bob watches her leave.

                                     MISS KAWASAKI
                         Mr. Harris

               He is approached by a group of eight excited people from the 
               commercial company there waiting to take him.

                                     PRESS AGENT
                              (as they are on their 
                              way)
                         We just got a request from Tanabe 
                         Mori-he is the Johnny Carson of Japan! 
                         It is a big honor to be invited to 
                         his show.

               Bob feigns enthusiasm briefly.

                                     MISS KAWASAKI
                         Can you stay until Friday?

                                     BOB
                         I'll have to see about that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PHOTO STUDIO - DAY

               Bob's back is to us as a MAKE-UP ARTIST is putting some final 
               touches on him. The PHOTOGRAPHER is giving her enthusiastic 
               direction in Japanese. Bob talks on his cell phone, not paying 
               attention to the make-up artist.

                                     BOB
                         Can you get me on a flight Thursday 
                         night?

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         We're looking into it Bob, but they 
                         really want you to stay to do that 
                         talk show Friday, apparently it's a 
                         really big deal, he's the Johnny 
                         Carson of Japan.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, they told me.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         These people are paying you a lot, 
                         do you think you could consider it?

                                     BOB
                         Just get me out of here as soon as 
                         you can.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         Ok, you're scheduled to leave 
                         Saturday, but we'll hold a seat 
                         Thursday in case, but first class is 
                         full, you're waitlisted for an 
                         upgrade... there might be a seat on 
                         Lufthansa...

                                     BOB
                         Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, 
                         bye.

               He hangs up. The make-up artist dusts him with powder.

               The commercial people are crowding around. Bob's chair is 
               swivelled around and we see him in his tuxedo, wearing too 
               much make-up and some weird looking eyeliner.

               In front of a grey backdrop, moody lighting is being adjusted 
               and Bob is handed a bottle of Suntory.

               small documentary crew moves in on Bob with a video camera- 
               the camera man is tilting the camera at his face in arty 
               dutch camera moves.

               The agency people crowd around. The photographer is excited 
               and urges Bob to do dumb poses, he won't do.

                                     PHOTOGRAPHER
                         Can you put hands close to face.

               The photographer demonstrates a dramatic pose with his hands 
               at his face.

                                     BOB
                         Urn, I don't think so. How bout I 
                         just hold the bottle.

               The photographer starts shooting. Bob obviously hates the 
               whole thing, what you do for money.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob, still in his tuxedo and make-up from the shoot, sits 
               alone having a drink. A JAZZ BAND FROM SAUSALITO performs. 
               The SINGER is a middle-aged woman with red wavy hair, dressed 
               in red, and takes her singing very seriously. She sings a 
               slow version of "Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme".

               C.U. - a golden beer is poured very slowly.

               Bob drinks his scotch, hoping it will all go away.

               Across the bar, Charlotte sits with JOHN, her husband (he is 
               in his late twenties and sloppy in a fashionable way), and 
               some FRIENDS - super stylish, weird Japanese fashion people 
               (all smoking). One of them, CHARLIE, in a shiny suit, keeps 
               taking pictures, and showing them magazine layouts.

                                     JAZZ SINGER
                         Thank you. We're glad to be here, 
                         we're Sausalito.

               Charlotte laughs and looks down, the Japanese audience clap 
               very seriously... she and Bob catch eyes - about Sausalito 
               and how weird it is there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

               The mirrored elevator doors close and Bob sees himself close-
               up in the elevator's mirrored walls - noticing the heavy 
               makeup and weird eyeliner from the shoot which he had 
               forgotten about. He looks at himself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlotte lays close to her young husband, John. She looks 
               to see if he's awake, but he's sleeping soundly. She leans 
               her chin on his shoulder.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you awake?

               He doesn't answer.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         John?

               He grumbles something, opens one sleepy eye to look at her, 
               and grabs her under the covers. He kisses her.

                                     JOHN
                         Go to sleep.

               He holds her close, but she can't sleep.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte sits on a ledge looking out at the big buildings. 
               The sun is starting to come up. Below she watches cars going 
               places.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob lies in bed awake. The clock says 4:20.

               The in-room fax machine is making noise as a fax rolls in. 
               Bob looks at the fax machine but doesn't get out of bed.

               The fax curls and falls to the floor.

               CLOSE ON FAX -

               "BOB-

               YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHICH SHELVES YOU WANT IN YOUR STUDY. 
               PLEASE PICK ONE OUT AND LET ME KNOW. I'M HAVING LOTS OF 
               QUALITY TIME WITH THE CONSTRUCTION CREW. HOPE YOU'RE HAVING 
               FUN THERE. LOVE, L"

               Three pages of shelf diagrams follow.

               INT. HOTEL GYM - NIGHT

               The gym is empty except for an old man vacuuming. Bob passes 
               piles of little towels and bottles of water. He takes a water 
               for his workout.

               He approaches an exercise machine and puts the water in the 
               drink holder of the machine. He looks at the lit-up 
               instruction panel'99 it is all in Japanese.

               He pushes a button, and the machine starts beeping, then a 
               soothing woman's voice recites instructions in Japanese.

               He gets on it, and sinks. He tries to make the arms and foot 
               peddles coordinate. He pushes a button and it starts moving 
               too fast. In an upward rotation he tries to reach the control 
               panel, but is not fast enough. The soothing woman's voice 
               continues instruction.(she occasionally includes an English 
               word- gently,   gently...vigorous)   He tries to keep up 
               with it, and tries again to push the right button to slow it 
               down, but the machine steps starts going swiftly backwards 
               instead.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The agency group wait for Bob. They stand up as he approaches 
               from the elevator, trying to mask a slight limp.

                         Good morning.

               Miss Kawasaki notices his limp with concern as they leave 
               the hotel.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA STATION - DAY

               Charlotte gets out at shibuya station, a crowded neighborhood 
               filled with neon, ads, and people.

               She looks up at the huge intersection as tons of JAPANESE 
               PEOPLE wait to cross the street, no one steps forward until 
               the cross-walk light changes, and all of them cross.

               A TV screen covering a building plays commercials.

               She roams around the narrow streets, crowded with stylish 
               JAPANESE KIDS, tan SCHOOLGIRLS pass her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte wanders down a crowded street, looking around.

               On a small side street she stops at a little park. She watches 
               a JAPANESE MAN AND WOMAN together:

               CHARLOTTE'S POV -

               C.U. The man reaches his hand to the back of the woman's 
               neck, and leans in close. The woman smiles at him, in love.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               John is sound asleep. Charlotte is awake next to him. She 
               looks at the clock - it's three a.m.

               She slides close to him, kisses his mouth. He grumbles 
               something in his deep sleep, and rolls over.

               She goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment.

               She looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple. She 
               has a piece but isn't really hungry.

               She reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, 
               but she's already looked at it a few times before. She decides 
               to go downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Bob sits alone at the bar. Charlotte sits down a seat away 
               from him, lost in his thoughts, he doesn't see her until he 
               turns and finds her next to him. They look at each other. A 
               young BARTENDER with a sweet face tends to them.

                                     BARTENDER
                         What can I get you?

                         I'm not sure.

                         'Suntory time'!

               Charlotte smiles at him sympathetically

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What are you doing here?

                                     BOB
                         My wife needs space, I don't know my 
                         kids ' birthdays.  Everyone wants 
                         Tiger Woods, but they could get me, 
                         so I'm here doing a whiskey 
                         commercial.

               She looks at him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh.

               She lifts a cigarette, he lights it for her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'll just have a beer.

               He makes small talk about the pickled seaweed breakfast and 
               jet lag, they commiserate about having not slept in days.

                                     BOB
                         What about you? Why are you here?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         My husband's here for work-he's a 
                         photographer- and I just came 
                         along...I'm not really doing anything 
                         right now, and we have some friends 
                         who live here.

                                     BOB
                         How long have you been married?

                         Try twenty-five.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're probably just having a mid-
                         life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?

                                     BOB
                         I'm thinking about it.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         25 years... that's a long time... 
                         Are you still in love with your wife?

                                     BOB
                         Yes... I don't know, I don't know 
                         her anymore. I don't know if you can 
                         be in love with one person the whole 
                         time. I was... actually I was in 
                         love with her sister first, when I 
                         was twenty-one. And one day her sister 
                         said to me she wanted to move to 
                         Paris, so I said okay, and she said 
                         no, she wanted to move to Paris with 
                         Francois,   and she's still married 
                         to him. And I moved in with Lydia... 
                         but I always really liked Lydia.

                         I'm not sure, yet... I graduated 
                         last spring.

                         Oh, what do you do with that?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, but I can think about 
                         it, a lot.

                                     BOB
                         It takes a while to figure it out. 
                         I'm sure you will, though.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis 
                         will work out,too.

                         Thanks.

               They clink glasses.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

               The hotel is filled with business people. A dressed up FAMILY 
               is going to lunch. We follow a jet-lagged Charlotte and John, 
               as they walk down the lobby hall.

               An energetic blonde actress, KELLY, pops up to them. (She's 
               carrying a copy of Memoirs of a Geisha.)

               John, who was holding Charlotte's hand, drops it.

                                     KELLY
                         John! What are you doing here?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm just here shooting this band, 
                         what about you?

                         Promoting that action movie I did...

               She does a karate chop and laughs.

                                     KELLY
                         ...doing like twenty million 
                         interviews a day... It's soo good to 
                         see you. How long are you here for?

                                     JOHN
                         We're here for the week. I'm shooting 
                         in Osaka for a few days.

                                     KELLY
                         It's amazing  there!

                                     JOHN
                         Have you met Charlotte? My wife.

                                     KELLY
                         No!  Hi! So great to meet you!

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi, nice to meet you.

                                     KELLY
                         You know, John, you're my favorite 
                         photographer, I only want to be shot 
                         by you.

               Charlotte looks at John.

                                     JOHN
                         Uh..thanks.

                                     KELLY
                              (as she fans out her

                         Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've 
                         been sweating in this little room 
                         with T.V. lights for hours...

               Kelly, giggling and acting all too comfortable with herself, 
               is eating up all the oxygen around them.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh no...

                                     KELLY
                              (with a big smile)
                         ...Well, I have the worst  headache, 
                         I have to go find some aspirin. But, 
                         call me, let's have a drink, I'm 
                         under Evelyn Waugh.

               Kelly giggles. Charlotte smirks.

                                     JOHN
                         Ok, see you later.

               And Kelly and her make-up artist and publicist are off. John 
               and Charlotte continue.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Evelyn Waugh?

                                     JOHN
                         What?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Evelyn Waugh was a man.

               John shrugs.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, c'mon, she's nice.  Not everyone 
                         went to Yale.

               Charlotte shoots him a look.

                                     JOHN
                         Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't 
                         matter.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why do you have to defend her?

                                     JOHN
                         I'm not, but do you have to point 
                         out how stupid everyone is.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No, I thought it was funny. Forget 
                         it.

               His producer comes up to them. John puts his arm around 
               Charlotte, kisses her, everything's fine.

                                     PRODUCER
                              (looks at his watch)
                         We should get going.

                                     JOHN
                         OK, I'll see you later.

               He kisses her on the cheek, and is gone.

               feet as she clips her toenails.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte looks in a mirror, trying on an unfinished scarf 
               she's knitting.  She checks the length on herself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte sits on the big window sill checking her messages 
               on the phone.

                         Hi Charlotte, I don't know if you're 
                         in town... but I'm having a birthday 
                         party for my dog, Louise, tomorrow 
                         night, at my house around eight...

                         fabulous time in Japan!  How exciting, 
                         and hope you and your adorable husband 
                         are enjoying it...I was sitting next 
                         to Cathryn Myles last night at this 
                         dinner and she was telling me about 
                         her daughter who had this awful 
                         boyfriend and a messy break-up and 
                         how hard it is,and now she's single 
                         and wants to start a family, I'm so 
                         glad that you're settled, and not in 
                         that situation.  Anyway, call me 
                         when you have a chance, I'm trying 
                         to put Thanksgiving plans together, 
                         whether we want to go skiing or. 
                         Daddy wants to stay home and have it 
                         here, which might be easier with 
                         Lauren and the children, but let me 
                         know what your feelings are, I do 
                         hope you and John can make it. Call 
                         me, I love you.

               Charlotte lies on the bed, in the knit scarf and underwear 
               She's doing a quiz in a magazine:

               "ARE YOU HAVING A MID-TWENTIES CRISIS?

               ARE YOU FATIGUED?

               INT. HOTEL POOL - DAY

               An Olympic pool is framed by tall glass walls with the Tokyo 
               view. Bob is handed a swim cap and goggles.

               Bob watches a Japanese BUSINESSMAN swimming, he looks like 
               an over-grown baby.

               Bob swims laps in the pristine pool.

               He continues his laps. Under water he sees the jumping legs 
               of MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN.

               A disco mixed tape starts, and above water we see a WESTERN 
               INSTRUCTOR in tight shorts leading an aqua-aerobics class to 
               the group of WOMEN, They jump up and down to Sister Sledge.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL SPA - DAY

               Bob walks past the rows of lockers to the Sauna room.

               He sits in the sauna, two HOTEL GUESTS speak German in the 
               corner.

               Bob comes out from the sauna, red and sweaty.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob submerges in the cold water of a small pool in the sauna 
               room, having a moment of relief.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte lies on the floor with big headphones on, listening 
               to a book on tape. After a corny music intro, a very serious 
               scholar man's voice speaks clearly :

               DR. KENGARD (0.S.) Did you ever wonder what your purpose in 
               life is? This book is about finding your soul's purpose or 
               destiny. Every soul has its path, but sometimes that path is 
               not clear.  The acorn theory is an example of each soul 
               beginning with an imprint....

               Charlotte tries to get into it, but can't get past feeling 
               like a loser listening to a self-help tape. She looks at the 
               doctor's photo on the audio-book box, he's bald, in a 
               turtleneck and glasses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL - DAY

               Charlotte follows a JAPANESE FAMILY in formal dress out of 
               the elevator onto the mezzanine level. She wanders down a 
               big hall.

               She sees an open door and steps in the crowded room, which 
               is in the midst of a press conference. Cameras flash as Kelly, 
               with wide eyes, behind a table, answers questions 
               enthusiastically.

               KELLY You know, barbecuing, and yoga, and I love taking my 
               dogs, Buster and Lulu, for walks on the beach... and it was 
               great learning karate for "Midnight Racer" - I did all my 
               own stunts!

               The JAPANESE JOURNALISTS seem excited by her answer.

               Kelly throws a Karate punch for a PHOTOGRAPHER.

                         What was it like working with Keanu 
                         Reeves?

                                     KELLY
                         It was great. I've known him for a 
                         while now- you know we both live in 
                         L.A. We both have dogs...

               Charlotte walks out.

               INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

               Charlotte continues down a hall, she stops at an open door 
               and peeks in.

               A quiet group of JAPANESE WOMEN are gathered around a table. 
               Charlotte goes in, as she gets closer she sees they are being 
               instructed in Ikebana floral design. Each woman has a little 
               vase and elegant flower cuttings. She watches as they 
               delicately arrange the tiny flowers.

               The INSTRUCTOR hands Charlotte a vase and cuttings. Alongside 
               the women, Charlotte tries to follow along.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL - BATHROOM

               Charlotte reclines low in the bathtub staring off. She can 
               see mount Fuji in the distance.

               The audio tape plays on the stereo.

                                     DR. KENEGARD

                         Plato's text calls this image the 
                         "paradeigma".  So the lot is the 
                         image that is your inheritance, your 
                         place on earth, all compacted into a 
                         pattern that has been selected by 
                         your soul before you even got here-
                         or better said, that is always and 
                         continually being selected by your 
                         soul,because time does not enter the 
                         equation of myth.-

               With her back to us, Charlotte looks out the big window.

               John comes up and kisses her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How'd it go today?

                         Good...I'm tired.

               He hugs her for a moment, leaning on her.

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink 
                         downstairs. She wants to talk about 
                         some photo thing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.

                                     JOHN
                         You wanna come?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Sure.

                                     JOHN
                              (doesn't really want 
                              her to)
                         Ok.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               At a corner table Charlotte sits with John, Kelly, and DJ 
               CLEAN, a skinny kid in a sweatshirt, on tour in Japan.

               Charlotte is bored while Kelly talks on.

               Sausalito performs in the background.

                                     KELLY
                         ...My Dad was anorexic.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         (she's never heard of that)
                         Really?

               John shoots Charlotte a look.

                                     KELLY
                              (very serious)
                         He was on the American side at the 
                         Bay of Pigs, in Cuba, and he was 
                         taken prisoner, and they tortured 
                         them about their food the whole time.

                                     BENZO
                         Where?

                                     KELLY
                         My dad fought on the American side 
                         at the Bay of Pigs. So, when he was 
                         a prisoner, they would tell them 
                         they had put poison in their food 
                         and they would make themselves throw 
                         up... and when he got back, he did 
                         better, but he still has food issues. 
                         He has to have really clean food.  
                         And really simple. He can't just go 
                         have, say, Chinese food.

                                     JOHN
                              (trying)
                         Oh, that's too bad.

               Charlotte ashes her cigarette in a clean ashtray, and she 
               watches as it is quickly replaced with a new one by a WAITER.

                                     BENZO

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, it is.

               DJ Clean starts doing a human beat box at her.

               Charlotte looks over at Kelly.

                                     KELLY
                         ...Oh my god you have to try it, 
                         this power cleanse is amazing- it's 
                         lemon juice and grade B maple syrup 
                         and cayenne pepper for seven days. 
                         Just like a half a teaspoon of 
                         cayenne. The first few days you're a 
                         little scattered, but by day four - 
                         it's amazing... my eyes were so 
                         white...

               Charlotte excuses herself.

               She passes Bob who sits at his usual spot at the bar, as she 
               is leaving.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi again, how's it going?

                         Who do I have to fuck to get off 
                         this planet?

               Charlotte laughs with sympathy, but doesn't know what to 
               tell him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               John sleeps soundly (turned away from her), Charlotte can't 
               sleep. She turns on the T.V. to a crazy local T.V. variety 
               show.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob can't sleep, he watches the same show on T,V.

               He flips the channel- it's an old black & white Japanese 
               movie of a man committing Hari Kari.

               FADE IN:

               EXT. TOKYO - MORNING

               Charlotte finds her way down a narrow street in an old section 
               of Tokyo.

               She turns a corner and finds a square with what she was 
               looking for.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               The sun shines over a beautiful old temple. Birds chirp, 
               Charlotte approaches and goes inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TEMPLE - DAY

               Charlotte stands in the back and watches a ceremony.

               A ROSHI speaks in Japanese, monks chant. It's all very 
               foreign.  Charlotte tries to feel something.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte sits on the bed talking to John who's coming out 
               of the bathroom, getting ready to go to work. He checks 
               himself in the mirror, CHARLOTTE Am I shallow?

                                     JOHN
                         No, what are you talking about.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I went to a temple today and I didn't 
                         feel anything.

                                     JOHN
                         That's ok.

               He looks for his mobile phone.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know what to do.

                                     JOHN
                         That's ok, you'll figure it out.

               He comes close and kisses her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You smell weird.

                                     JOHN
                         What?

               She leans back to look at him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Like popcorn?

                                     JOHN
                         I got some hair stuff.

               She looks at him funny.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hair stuff?

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go to work.

               He grabs her, kissing her good-bye, she wraps her him, when 
               his cell phone rings.

                                     JOHN
                         I'll be right down...I'm just 
                         leaving...ok.

               He kisses her, and leaves.

                                     JOHN
                         See you later.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Bye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               She makes a call. We see her back and hair, as she looks out 
               the bright window.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Lauren?

                                     LAUREN (O.S.)
                         Charlotte?! How's Tokyo?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's cool... but,I don't know... I 
                         went to a shrine today and all these 
                         little monk's were chanting... and, 
                         I didn't feel anything... I even 
                         tried ikebana, ...   and John's using 
                         hair products... I don't know who 
                         I.

               Lauren's Call-waiting beeps, cutting off her sentence.

                                     LAUREN
                         Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Sure.

               Charlotte waits.

                                     LAUREN
                         Sorry about that, what were you 
                         saying?

               In the background a baby starts crying.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, it's nothing... I better go, 
                         I'll talk to you later.

                                     LAUREN
                         Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky 
                         you don't have any kids yet and you 
                         can go off to Japan... call me when 
                         you get back.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok, bye.

               She hangs up. She sits there for a moment, starting to cry, 
               she wipes the tears, trying to make them go away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SUBWAY - AFTERNOON

               Tokyo goes by out the window. Charlotte looks at the PEOPLE 
               on the crowded train. A sweaty BUSINESSMAN blots his face 
               with a little handkerchief.  Another older BUSINESSMAN reads 
               an erotic comic book.

               INT. SUBWAY STATION - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte looks up at the many signs, trying to figure out

               which way to go, but they are all in Japanese characters. 
               Confused, she chooses the west exit.

               EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

               Charlotte walks down a little street in a quiet neighborhood.

               She stops at a window of a portrait studio and looks at all 
               of the wedding portraits. They are very formal and retouched, 
               Japanese brides and grooms dressed in a Western old-fashion 
               style.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ARCADE - DAY

               Charlotte looks through the window as a tan Japanese boy, 
               tries to win a stuffed animal for his girlfriend.

               INT. ARCADE - AFTERNOON

               In a crowded arcade, Charlotte watches some kids play Dance 
               Revolution, a video game where you dance along to cues on 
               the

               light-up floor. One BUSINESSMAN in a suit is really good and 
               into it.

               She sees a sushi chef game where you have to cut an electronic 
               fish.

               She looks at a firefighter game, and rows of plexi boxes 
               filled with some little character dolls you try to win.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GALLERY BOOKSTORE - DAY

               Charlotte looks at the shelves of books she passes, she flips 
               through some books.

               She walks over to a small gallery space and goes up to the 
               wall to see the small photos.

               They are of tied-up, partially naked Japanese school girls, 
               one girl is spanking another one with a stuffed animal. She's 
               making a face of ecstacy.

               Charlotte looks at it, not getting it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY

               Charlotte stands alone on a side street, smoking a cigarette 
               and watching the CROWDS go by.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHIBUYA - DAY

               Charlotte walks up a little street filled with shops.

               She stops at a window of cute underwear that she.looks at. 
               She goes into the shop.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               on.She looks at herself in the mirror in her new underwear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               We hear the shower running in the bathroom.

               Charlotte decorates the room, putting up some paper cherry 
               blossom decorations.

               She goes over to the bed and stubs her toe on it, as she 
               flops down.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ouch.

               She holds her toe, annoyed with her klutziness.

               John talks to her from the shower.

                                     JOHN (O.C.)
                         At the fitting, they had all these 
                         rock n roll clothes, the label guys 
                         kept saying lock n loll, though, but 
                         the band doesn't look tough at 
                         all...they look better just skinny 
                         and nerdy, like how when they came 
                         in...they looked so uncomfortable in 
                         these Keith Richards clothes, they 
                         should just be like they are, don't 
                         you think?

               She's drifted off.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah.

                                     JOHN
                         Yeah, I think you're probably right... 
                         because when you try to...

               He gets out and is rushing to get his stuff together to go. 
               Charlotte's lounging on the bed in her new pink underwear.

               She tries her scarf on that she's been knitting.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Do you think it's done?

                                     JOHN
                         I don't know.

               He goes to get all his stuff together.

               He passes an ashtray with cigarette butts in it.

                                     JOHN
                         Will you please stop smoking?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But I like to... and I don't smoke 
                         that much.

                                     JOHN
                         Its bad for you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Ok, I will... later.

               He picks up a camera from a table in the corner. He looks at 
               the self-help audio book box.

                                     JOHN
                         A Soul's Search: Finding Your True 
                         Character and calling? Is this yours?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh... that's nothing, someone gave 
                         it to me.

                                     JOHN
                         You don't have to be embarrassed.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm 
                         not into it.

                                     JOHN
                         It's ok if you are.

               He kisses the side of her face and her shoulder like a cute 
               pet, and then continues getting his stuff together.

               John sets two bottles of Cristal on the bed next to her, not 
               really seeing her.

                                     JOHN
                         Oh, the record company sent these...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.

                                     JOHN
                         I gotta go... and I don't really 
                         like champagne.

               As he unplugs his cell phone from the wall.

                                     JOHN
                         Are you sure you want to stay?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Are you sure you have to go?

               He looks at her - like don't make it harder.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah, I know you have to work the 
                         whole time, I'll probably have more 
                         fun here. I'll call Charlie and those 
                         guys.

                                     JOHN
                         Ok, definitely call them, I'll be 
                         back Friday. I love you.

               They kiss.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I love you.

               He tackles her, kisses her, bites her, grabs her ribs, 
               tickling her in a burst of affection. She laughs, her arms 
               around his neck.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I miss you.

                                     JOHN
                         It'll just be a few days.

               He kisses her and is off.

               Charlotte sits there alone with the unopened bottles of 
               champagne.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Water splashes as Charlotte dives into the pool (in a one-
               piece bathing suit) as the sun goes down.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. PARK HYATT HALL - EVENING

               Leaving in her robe, Charlotte runs into Bob, in his robe, 
               going to the pool.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, hi.

                                     BOB
                              (awkward, but glad to 
                              run into her)
                         Hi. Did you have a nice swim?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah. Did you get some sleep?

                                     BOB
                         No, how about you?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Not really. How long are you here 
                         for?

                                     BOB
                         I'm here for the week.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, good. Do you want to go to a 
                         party tonight with me and some friends 
                         who live here?

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         See you later.

               He watches her go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - EVENING

               As Bob opens his door to his room, a FedEx package falls in 
               his path.

               He opens it - large carpet swatches fall out with a note

               "BOB - WHICH ONE DO YOU WANT FOR YOUR STUDY? I LIKE THE 
               BURGUNDY, BUT WHATEVER YOU WANT. LOVE, L"

               He looks at them for a second, they all look the same, and 
               why is she sending these? He puts them down.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               The elaborate chiming doorbell rings.

               Charlotte opens the door to see Bob. He's wearing an orange 
               camouflage T-shirt. She looks at his shirt, suppressing a 
               smile.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You really are having a mid-life 
                         crisis.

                                     BOB
                              (embarrassed)
                         I know, it's stupid.

               He goes into the bathroom to change it. He comes out with it 
               on inside out so it's just an orange T-shirt.

               He asks her to cut the label out for him. She goes to find 
               some scissors. He picks up A Soul's Search: Finding Your 
               True Calling audio-book box.

                                     BOB
                         A Soul's Search: Finding Your True 
                         Calling - are you reading this?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No.

               She returns with the hotel room sewing kit.

                                     BOB
                         I read it, too.

               She smiles, busted, but doesn't say anything as she cuts his 
               shirt label with little hotel sewing-kit scissors.

               She slips on her shoes on to leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOKYO BAR - NIGHT

               All white nightclub, lit with black lights so it seems to 
               glow in the dark, with the booming sound of helicopters. 
               JAPANESE GALLAGER BROTHERS walk by.

               Bob watches Charlotte as Charlie, in a crazy outfit, hugs 
               her.  Charlotte tries to talk to Bob over the loud music.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Charlie, this is Bob. Bob  Charlie 
                         Brown.

                                     BOB
                         Hi, Charlie.

               They shake hands.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         His real name's Hayashi, but someone 
                         started calling him Charlie because 
                         they thought he looked like Charlie 
                         Brown. They've all got American 
                         nicknames because its easier for me 
                         to remember... they were just out in 
                         L.A. last month doing a shoot with 
                         John... that guy's Mr.Valentine, 
                         he's the art director of their 
                         magazine, I don't even know his real 
                         name, or why I call him that.

               Bob looks over at some SKINNY GUY in huge glasses smiling at 
               them. Charlie hands them some drinks.

                                     CHARLIE
                         This is Bambi.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi.

               A young SHY GUY with a shaved head smiles at her, and takes 
               her picture.

               A JAPANESE KRAFTWERK COVER-BAND plays Trans Europa Express.

               Some people at the bar buy drinks for Bob and insist on 
               drinking with him.

               Bob and Charlotte look over as Charlie gets into some problem 
               with the BARTENDER.  The Bartender gets mad and starts 
               shooting a real-looking BB gun at him. Orange bullets fly 
               through the air. They all rush out of there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte try to get past the crowd at the entrance. 
               A big BOUNCER stops them and is yelling fast Japanese at 
               him.

               The crowd parts as the Bartender emerges shooting his BB 
               gun, and Bob and Charlotte run for it.

               BB GUN CHASE -

               The Bartender climbs on a car, threatening them from above. 
               Bob covers Charlotte as they duck behind the car.

               They make a run for it, ducking into a pachinko parlor.

               INT.PACHINKO PARLOR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte run past the blinking machines, and 
               gamblers, to another door to the street.

               EXT. STREET - NIGHT

               Bob spots a cab and they run to it, seeing Charlie now 
               throwing bottles in the direction of the bartender.

               Bob and Charlotte get in the cab.

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               Charlotte hits her head as they get in. Bob yells to the 
               driver to go, but he doesn't understand.

               Through the windshield they see the Bartender and sidekick 
               coming with baseball bats.

               They hear a bang on the door and Charlie hops in. He makes 
               sure she is ok and shouts something to the Driver, and they 
               speed away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

               Charlie, in his flashy outfit, sings "God Save the Queen" 
               into the Karaoke mic. He rolls his r's just like Johnny 
               Rotten.

               Charlotte laughs and loves watching Charlie. They're other 
               friends wear the different color wigs they provide at this 
               place. There are big bottles of beer and sake.  They are all 
               pretty formal. Bambi tries to talk to Charlotte with a big 
               grin, he can barely speak English.

                                     BAMBI
                         How's california?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (smiles)
                         Good.

                                     BAMBI
                         Good... I like your swimming pool.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Thanks, you guys should come back 
                         sometime.

                                     BAMBI
                         Yes.

               He tries wigs on her. He puts a light pink wig on her and 
               beams. Bob smokes and watches.

                                     BAMBI
                         Kawaii.
                              (Kawaii means "cute")

               She smiles a lovable smile at Bambi.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie and Charlotte sings "Brass in Pocket" by The 
               Pretenders ("you're special, so special..."), everyone is 
               drunk now, as they all sing along at the chorus. WOMEN keep 
               refilling the glasses.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Mr. Valentine sings a popular slow heartfelt Japanese song 
               that everyone knows and sings along to. Charlotte and Bob 
               look at each other, it is very foreign, but Bob likes being 
               there with Charlotte and her friends.

               She flips through a big binder of songs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What do you feel like singing, Bob?

                                     BOB
                         No way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob sings "I fall to Pieces" to Charlotte. Charlie and 
               everyone cheers for him.

               Beer pitchers are replaced. Charlie starts singing "Angle". 
               The little room is fxlled with smoke, Charlotte makes her 
               way to the door to get some air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. KARAOKE BAR HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Taking a break from the crowded and hot Karaoke room, 
               Charlotte sits for a break alone on a bench in the bright 
               hallway. It is quiet with just the muffled sound of music 
               from the Karaoke room. She's wearing a pink geisha wig. Bob 
               sits down next to her.

               Charlotte lights his cigarette with some crazy Japanese light-
               up lighter.

               She leans her head back - it's getting too heavy.

               She looks at his hands.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You bite your nails?

               He nods.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I could cut the ones that are left 
                         for you.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NOBU, a cool skinny stoner guy in a Hawaiian shirt, plays 
               phsycadellic records in his seventies hippie surfer-pad.

               His JAPANESE  GIRLFRIEND, who looks like a 60's pin-up,   
               pours cold sake.

               Bob is  handed a ridiculously big bong.

               Charlie is drunk and taking polaroids.

               Nobu, really stoned, talks to Bob about surfing.

               A SHORT GUY with thick glasses introduces himself to 
               Charlotte, extending his hand.

                                     HANS
                         I'm Hans.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hans?  Nice to meet you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlie takes pictures of Charlotte and HIROMIX, a sexy 
               Japanese girl, posing on a sheepskin run. They are being 
               hammy for Charlie who loves it.

               Bob walks up and is amused watching her, she sees him and 
               gets embarrassed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               DECADENT TOKYO PARTY - NIGHT

               Hiromix dances  Charlotte dances with Hans - she looks sweaty 
               but beautiful... Bob dances with his eyes closed, really 
               into it, in the midst of all of them... the song "I Feel Too 
               Young" plays.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NOBU'S ENTRY - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte are leaving Nobu's. She's wearing Bob's 
               jacket.

                                     CHARLIE
                         Make sure she gets home okay?

                                     BOB
                         I will.

               Bob takes Charlotte's arm carefully just as she bangs her 
               head walking into the glass door - it makes a loud thud.

                                     BOB
                         Are you ok?

               She nods. Bob looks back at Charlie who is watching- she's 
               fine.

               He leads her into a waiting cab.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               POV from cab - Tokyo neon blurs by. It looks beautiful.

               INT. CAB - NIGHT

               Charlotte looks at the neon going by. She looks over at Bob, 
               her eyelids are too heavy for her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't want to go home.

                         I know. I don't either.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL HALL - NIGHT

               Bob carries a very drunk Charlotte to her room. Her purse 
               dangling from his arm.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - NIGHT

               He puts her on her bed. He takes her shoes off for her and 
               pulls a blanket over her.

               He looks at her lying on the bed.

               She opens her eyes to smile at him. He wants to kiss her, 
               but he leaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOTEL HALL - NIGHT

               He walks down the empty hall, not wanting to leave her.

               As he goes he looks at various trays of leftover room service 
               in the hallway.

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob comes back to his room, tripping over the carpet samples.

               He makes a phone call from bed. He's still a little drunk 
               and thinking about his night out in Tokyo.

                         Lydia, I went to this great house 
                         tonight, this guy designed and built, 
                         you would have loved it.

                                     BOB
                         He was this fashion guy, and there 
                         were all these Japanese fashion people-
                         it's a whole other world, and I was 
                         talking to these Japanese surfers...  
                         He was playing all this great music- 
                         I have to find out what it was...

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         That sounds great  can you hold 
                         on...

                         I don't want it.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Well, you have to have something for 
                         breakfast. Do you want cereal?

                                     ZOE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Just trying to get her to eat 
                         something...I'm glad you're having 
                         fun.

                         Yeah, its really different here.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Well, that's good, I have to get the 
                         kids off for school.  Can I call you 
                         in a little while?

                                     BOB
                         It's four in the morning... I'm going 
                         to go to sleep.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Ok, well... I love you.

                                     BOB
                         I love you, too, good-night, or good-
                         morning .

               He hangs up.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING

               Charlotte can-'t get out of bed. She looks at the clock- 
               it's 10 a.m.  She picks up the phone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Charlotte, who?

                                     CHARLOTTE (O.S.)
                         Thanks for getting me back in one 
                         piece.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Of course.

                         Do you want to have some breakfast?

               C.U. her hand wraps the phone cord around her fingers.

                                     BOB (O.S.)
                         Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and 
                         I'll meet you downstairs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         OK, see you downstairs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - DAY

               They sit in the bright light. She squints and drinks a Bloody 
               Mary. Bob is distant.

               She looks across at two middle-aged MID-WESTERN WOMEN talking 
               about plastic surgery, you can't hear them, but can tell as 
               they gesture and one pulls her eye lids up.

               Charlotte looks at another table by the elaborate buffet and 
               sees the redhead Singer having breakfast with the rest of 
               Sausalito.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (trying to make it 
                              light)
                         Hey look, it's Sausalito.

                                     BOB
                         I see them every morning.

               They don't know what to say. Somehow it's too intimate having 
               breakfast. She eats her breakfast aware of her every movement.

               C.U. - her POV of soft scrambled eggs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               In the distance, Bob swings on a perfect golf course.

               INT. CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Charlotte lies in bed awake. The clock says its 4 a.m.

               Finally she gives up on trying to sleep, and turns the light 
               on. In John's old T-shirt and Ugg boots, she goes to the 
               couch, looks at some strange pastry with an elaborate 
               presentation left by the hotel.

               She picks up a magazine, but she's already looked at it a 
               few times before. She hears something and goes over to the 
               door. On her way, she passes her red T. Anthony suitcase 
               overflowing with stuff that looks like a bomb went off in 
               it.

               A HOTEL MESSAGE envelope is slipped under the door. She opens 
               it to see a typed note from the operator:

               "From: Mr. Harris. Message: Are you awake?"

               She smiles like she's gotten a valentine.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - NIGHT

               Bob opens the door, Charlotte's standing there trying to 
               look casual, she's happy to see him (she's put some pants on 
               and flip flops instead of her dumb looking Ugg boots).

               She knocks into a low table, bumping her knee as she comes 
               in.

               Bob pours some cold sake, smoothly.

               Bob and Charlotte watch La Dolce Vita with Japanese subtitles 
               on the TV.

                                     BOB
                         Hans was very attentive to you.

                         I think he kind of liked me...Is 
                         that so hard to imagine?

                                     BOB
                         No, its easy.

                         How'd a Japanese guy get a name like 
                         Hans?

               Charlotte gets up to pour more sake.

               She picks up and looks at a prescription bottle on his night 
               stand and reads the label : Lipitor.

                         Do you remember when we met at the 
                         bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.

                         But the first time I saw you was in 
                         the elevator.

                         Yeah, you don't remember?

               She shrugs.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Yeah? But look at you.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks. It does, the more you know 
                         who you are... you don't care about 
                         things the same way...

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I just don't know what I'm supposed 
                         to be. I thought maybe I wanted to 
                         be a writer... but I hate what I 
                         write, and I tried taking pictures, 
                         but John's so good at that, and mine 
                         are so mediocre... and every girl 
                         goes through a photography phase, 
                         like horses, you know dumb pictures 
                         of your feet...

                                     BOB
                         You'll figure it out. I'm not worried 
                         about you. Keep writing.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         But, I'm mean.

                                     BOB
                         That's ok.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         And marriage, does that get easier?

                                     BOB
                         It's hard. We started going to a 
                         marriage counselor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Did that help? Did you learn anything?

                                     BOB
                         We established that we have no 
                         communication.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh.

                                     BOB
                         We used to have fun, she used to 
                         like to go to places with me for my 
                         movies and we would laugh at all the 
                         weirdos, but now she's tired of it 
                         all. She never wants to leave the 
                         kids, she doesn't need me, and they 
                         don't need me, I feel like I'm in 
                         the way. It gets complicated when 
                         you have kids... that changes 
                         everything.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's too scary.

                                     BOB
                         When they're born its like Vietnam. 
                         It's terrifying.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (getting tired)
                         No one ever tells you that...

                                     BOB
                         But, it's great being with them, 
                         after they can talk, and can do things 
                         with you.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's nice. My parents were always 
                         traveling, they weren't around so 
                         much.

                                     BOB
                         Where'd you grow up?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador 
                         to France in the eighties, so we 
                         went to school in Paris for a few 
                         years... but we mostly lived in D.C., 
                         and they were never around... and 
                         then I moved to Los Angeles when 
                         John and I got married... it's so 
                         different there.

               They are starting to get tired.

                                     BOB
                         I know.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         John thinks I'm so snotty.

                                     BOB
                         You are.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know, but that's what you like 
                         about me.

               She looks over at him. He does like her.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Why do you have to be with your 
                         opposite, why cant similar people be 
                         together?

                                     BOB
                         Because that would be too easy.

               They fall asleep dressed, on top of the sheets, on opposite 
               sides of the bed.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               EXT.STREET BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Full of life, Bob plays basketball with some local guys.

               All over the court, and towering over the other players, Bob 
               dominates the game.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Bob looks at himself in the bathroom mirror, he feels his 
               stubble and sees that it's turning grey.

               He opens the hotel shaving kit. He squirts shaving cream 
               from the child-size can. Even the razor is small. He covers 
               his face with shaving cream when the phone rings.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                                     RECEPTION
                         Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     RECEPTION
                         Do you want I send it to your room?

                                     BOB
                              (sarcastic)
                         Great.

                                     RECEPTION
                         Thank you, Mr. Harris.

               He hangs up and shaves.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - DAY

               Bob gets out of the elevator- the Suntory group is waiting 
               for him. He ducks behind a wall and sneaks out a side entrance 
               of the hotel.

               EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

               Bob comes out of the hotel into the sunlight. The street is 
               crowded with MOTORCYCLE GANGS going by, one waves a big flag.

               Bob watches the strange scene in the street for a moment, 
               and then makes his way past.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAKINYAMA - DAY

               He walks down a little street in a more old-fashioned 
               neighborhood. He's wearing new techno sneakers. He makes a 
               call on his cell phone.

                                     BOB
                         Miss Kawasaki? It's Bob Harris... 
                         I'm not going to be able to do that 
                         interview today.., yeah... ok.... 
                         Yes, I'd love to stay to be on his 
                         talk show... sure.. ok... bye.

               A light rain starts as he looks at a fax from Charlotte with 
               a map she's drawn and tries to figure out where he is - there 
               are no street signs.

               EXT/INT. ICHICAN SUSHI - DAY

               Bob finally finds the small restaurant. The automatic door 
               opens for him, and Charlotte, at the bar with the cute chubby 
               SUSHI CHEF, turns to Bob happy to see him. He is disheveled 
               from the rain and adorable.

               He sits down next to Charlotte, she pours him a beer and 
               orders for him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You made it.

                                     BOB
                         They really have to work on that 
                         street name thing.

               A perky recording voice says "Kornichiwa!" from his pocket.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         What's that?

               He pulls a pink Hello Kitty watch from his pocket.

                                     BOB
                         It's for my daughter.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How old is she?

                                     BOB
                         Four.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, she'll love it.

               The Sushi Chef gives him perfect little pieces of sushi on a 
               banana leaf.

               Charlotte takes a bite of a piece - but it won't break, so 
               she has to stuff the whole thing in her mouth, embarrassed. 
               Bob makes fun of her gracelessness.

                                     BOB
                         Nice one.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (mouth full)
                         Fuck off.

               They have lunch, he makes her laugh.

               He looks down at her feet in flip flops, her toe is purple.

                                     BOB
                         What happened to your toe?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, I think maybe I broke 
                         it? I knocked into something the 
                         other day...

               She slips her shoe off and shows it to him- her middle toe 
               is black and blue.

                                     BOB
                         That doesn't look good.

               She enjoys the sympathy.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         It's bad isn't it?

                                     BOB
                         We should get you to the doctor.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You think so?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, look at that thing.

               She smiles at him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DAIKANYAMA STREET - DAY

               Bob tries to get a taxi, finally one stops and they get in. 
               He tries to explain "hospital", he does pantomime, draws a 
               first aid cross, but the DRIVER doesn't understand. Charlotte 
               is enjoying Bob's effort.

               Finally he finds a Park Hyatt matchbook and calls the hotel 
               number.

                                     BOB
                         How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?

                                     RECEPTION (O.S.)

                         One moment, please.

               She transfers call, it rings.

                         Concierge desk, may I help you?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, can you tell me how to say 
                         "hospital" in Japanese?

                                     CONCIERGE
                         "Hospital" in Japanese? Hosupitari.

                                     BOB
                         Hosupitari? 

               He tells the Driver who looks at him funny. Bob says it again-
               faster, with a Japanese accent. The driver nods excitedly 
               and drives off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT.HOSPITAL LOBBY - DAY

               Bob and Charlotte walk in, looking around at where to go.

               Bob talks to a woman at the desk to explain what they need.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL 2ND FLOOR - DAY

               Bob takes a seat in waiting area as Charlotte goes into a 
               little room with a number on it.

               Bob waits next to a 100 year old lady.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Charlotte stands alone barefoot on a little box, wearing a 
               lead apron, as a MAN and ASSISTANT X-ray different angles of 
               her foot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP - DAY

               Bob looks around at all the Japanese gift stuff, and buys a 
               little stuffed bunny. His phone rings as he's paying for it.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         Bob, it's me.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, hi, Elaine.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         So, we got you on an earlier flight, 
                         but I really think you should think 
                         about staying for that talk show.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

                                     ELAINE (O.S.)
                         You'll do it?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, I'll stay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte's foot X-rays are displayed on a big light box. An 
               older DOCTOR talks about them in Japanese to his younger 
               ASSISTANT as he wraps Charlotte's toes together. She doesn't 
               know what they're talking about.

               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY

               Charlotte comes out where Bob waits with the little stuffed 
               bunny.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Is that for me?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - LATE AFTERNOON

               Bob and Charlotte arrive back at the massive hotel, they 
               stroll in casually, she is carrying the stuffed rabbit in 
               her arm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Bob reclines in the big Japanese wooden tub, steam rises as 
               he is turning red. His phone rings. He dries his hands quickly 
               to reach it before it stops ringing.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                         Bob?

                                     BOB
                         Hi, Lydia.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Is this a bad time?

                                     BOB
                         Uh, no.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         (O.S.) It's really hard to reach 
                         you... Did you get the carpet samples? 
                         I like the burgundy.

                                     BOB
                         Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         It's just carpet.

                                     BOB
                         That's not what I'm talking about.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BOB
                         I don't know.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Is there anything I can do?

                                     BOB
                         I don't know... I want to be more 
                         healthy. I want to eat better.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         What?

                                     BOB
                         You know, eat healthier.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Alright?

                                     BOB
                         Not all that pasta.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Fine.

                              (sarcastic)
                         Why don't you just stay there, and 
                         you can have it everyday.

                                     BOB
                         Oh, come on.

                         I'll talk to you later. Are you going 
                         to be Ok?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bob rides in the back of a cab.

                                     CHARLOTTE (V.O.)
                              (voice-mail message)
                         Hi Bob, it's Charlotte... how are 
                         you doing today?... I'm going to 
                         meet Charlie and those guys at this 
                         place called Orange around ten... 
                         come meet us if you get this...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bob's cab pulls up at an empty office building.

               INT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

               Bob looks at a fax from Charlotte with a map, wondering if 
               he's in the right place. It's quiet and looks like a generic 
               office building.

               He goes in the little metal elevator, and the door opens on 
               the 8th floor onto a little nightclub you would have never 
               thought was there.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ORANGE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

               Lights strobe and Peaches' seedy "Fuck the Pain Away" booms 
               through the speakers.

               Tan JAPANESE STRIPPERS with platinum hair dance and hang 
               from a pole on a little platform.

               Bob sits alone on a brown ultra suede couch feeling out of 
               place and empty.

               He looks over at a table of young AMERICAN INVESTMENT BROKERS. 
               He wishes he wasn't there, but tries to seem comfortable.

               Charlotte shows up with Charlie and the other guys. She sits 
               down next to him, and gives him an 'are you going to kill 
               me?' look.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         How long have you been here?

               He looks at her like it's been forever. She smiles for 
               forgiveness.

               They look over and see a WEIRD GUY in the corner getting a 
               lap dance, they look at each other, sharing the joke of the 
               place, but both uncomfortable about the sexuality of it.

               Through a beaded curtain, Charlie and Bambi get lap dances 
               in a dark corner of pillows.

               Charlotte looks at Bob.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         C'mon, let's go.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte go up to a cab, but the driver refuses 
               them. They don't know why, but just make their way down an 
               empty side street. Little plastic cherry blossom decorations 
               hang above them.

                                     BOB
                         Where's your husband?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (like she's said it a 
                              million times)
                         Working.

                                     BOB
                         Do you ever see him?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sorta)
                         Yeah.

                                     BOB
                         Do you know where we are?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         No.

               She puts a coin in a vending machine and takes a cold sake 
               "one-cup". A tiny brad Pitt head smiles at her next to an 
               iced coffee.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Isn't it weird there are no street 
                         names in Tokyo... you'd think a city 
                         like this would have street names... 
                         you need a map to get anywhere... 
                         look, there are no signs...

               They keep walking, small figures on a little empty street.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY - NIGHT

               As they make their way back, they pass a lounge off the lobby. 
               It's late, it's pretty empty,  a housekeeper vacuums and 
               just a SLEEPING MAN sits in the back of the lounge, and a 
               snuggled up romantic JAPANESE COUPLE sit close to: Kelly, 
               the blonde actress, singing to them.

               She stands facing them with a karaoke mic singing "Nobody 
               Does It Better" with all her heart.

               Bob and Charlotte look at each other and keep walking (trying 
               to be invisible).


               FADE IN:

               INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

               Charlotte lies in bed. She picks up a photo next to the bed 
               as she dials the phone.-

               The picture is of her and John on their honeymoon. The phone 
               answers - it's a weird Japanese recording.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? 
                         I'm not sure...I'm going to go to 
                         Kyoto for the day...I'11 try you 
                         when I get back. Hope it's going 
                         good... I love you, bye.

               INT. TRAIN - DAY

               Charlotte watches the Japanese countryside go by out her 
               window.

               EXT. KYOTO - DAY

               Charlotte walks through a beautiful garden. She's a small 
               figure in the landscape.

               She approaches a temple where she stops to watch a wedding 
               procession. A young bride and groom in traditional kimono 
               walk under a parasol with their family.

               Charlotte looks as- the nervous, young bride clutches her 
               mother's hand. The young groom walks along with them.

               Charlotte is moved by the whole scene, the beauty of the 
               temple and the wedding party. Her eyes well up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               She walks up a narrow path, surrounded by red maple leaves.

               At the top of a little hill, she comes up to a shrine.

               At its entrance she sees a tree covered in little white pieces 
               of paper tied to its branches. She sees Japanese people 
               writing on the paper and tying them to the tree. Charlotte 
               writes her wish on a paper and ties it to a branch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. T.V. STUDIO - DAY

               Exciting music plays as the talk/game show starts.

               Bob, in an elegant suit, goes out to meet the HOST.

                                     TV HOST
                              (in Japanese)
                         We hear you're quite a golfer.

               A TRANSLATOR translates.

                                     BOB
                              (nodding)
                         I enjoy the sport.

               The Translator translates - four sentences longer and with 
               added enthusiasm.

               After a few questions the Host excitedly announces something 
               to the AUDIENCE in Japanese. They scream, the lights flash, 
               Bob has no idea what's going on.

               A cloud of smoke reveals the IRON CHEF, with feathered hair, 
               wearing an 18th century waistcoat.  A large red chef hat is 
               placed on Bob's head.

                                     TRANSLATOR
                         They now have the competition for 
                         you with the Iron Chef.

               Bob looks around as a counter is pulled up to him and now 
               Bob and the Iron Chef are at dueling counters. The Host barks 
               instructions in Japanese, an apron with a stuffed animal 
               lobster on it is tied around Bob, the crowd cheers - there's 
               no way out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Bob rides in the back of the presidential, looking out the 
               window at the city.

               He pulls a polaroid out of his pocket and looks at it. It's 
               Charlotte, peering over her shoulder with a little smile, 
               from their sake-drenched night at Nobu's compound.

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               Melodramatic '70s Japanese music plays. Bob sits alone, hating 
               himself, at the bar. The redheaded Jazz Singer takes a break, 
               and a seat next to him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BOB'S ROOM - MORNING

               In the harsh-morning light, Bob wakes up in his bed.

               He hears the Jazz Singer singing in the shower "Midnight at 
               the Oasis".

               Her red mane of hair passes frame as she ushers in room 
               service. She seems to have taken over the whole room. He 
               wants it all to go away. She walks off to the bathroom and 
               there's a knock at the door. Bob rushes to get it before she 
               can.

               He opens the door a crack, Charlotte looking sweet, is 
               standing there. Her hair is back in a pony-tail. Bob's just 
               wearing a towel around his waist, and his hair is sticking 
               up.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Rough night?

               He's not in the mood, he looks at her like he already hates 
               himself, doesn't need more help.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want 
                         to come walk around?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, but no, I can't right now.

               The singer starts singing again in the background.

               Charlotte gives Bob a look.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want to be.

               He watches Charlotte walk away down the beige hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - DAY

               Bob is walking down the crowded street looking for Charlotte, 
               when his cell phone rings.

                                     BOB
                         Hello?

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Hello, Bob, it's me.

                                     BOB
                              (can't hear)
                         Hello?

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         It's Lydia, your wife.

                                     BOB
                         I couldn't hear you. How are you?

                                     LYDIA
                              (sighs)
                         Fine. Is it going ok?

                                     BOB
                         It's ok.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Do you want to-
                              (garbled)

                                     BOB
                         What?

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Do you want to talk to  Zoe?

                                     BOB
                         Yeah.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                              (calls in background)
                         Zoe, come say hello to your father...

               A little girl's voice shouts "No!" in the background.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         I guess she's busy.

                                     BOB
                         That's ok.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         When are you coming home?

                                     BOB
                         Tomorrow.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't 
                         forget.

                                     BOB
                         Ok.

               In the background the daughter calls for her Mommy over and 
               over and a dog starts barking.

                                     LYDIA (O.S.)
                         Ok, well, travel safely. See you 
                         soon.

                                     BOB
                         Bye.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ICHICAN SUSHI RESTAURANT - DAY

               Charlotte, with sunglasses on, leans against the wall as Bob 
               approaches.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan 
                         after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?

                                     BOB
                         No, we'll find something around here.

               She goes with him.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHABU SHABU RESTAURANT - DAY

               Bob and Charlotte are seated at a big booth in a corny Shabu 
               Shabu restaurant.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         The Jazz singer? The red-head?

               Bob looks at her like- don't make it worse.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I guess she's more around your 
                         age...  You guys could talk about 
                         things in common, like growing up in 
                         the fifties.

                                     BOB
                         You're a brat, wasn't there anyone 
                         else around to lavish you with 
                         attention?

               She scowls at him.

               The waitress brings them drinks- she pours beer slowly, and 
               turns on a pot on the table to cook their food.

               Charlotte looks at the menu - it is filled with photos of 
               different trays of meat. The waitress doesn't speak English.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I can't tell the difference?

               They have trouble ordering, but point to a picture on the 
               menu.

                                     BOB
                         We'll have two of these.

               He makes some small talk, she is bugged.

                                     BOB
                         What do you want to drink?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         A coke.

               He orders the drinks.

                                     BOB
                         So, where'd you go today.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Around.

               "This is the End" by The Doors starts playing on the stereo. 
               The waitress brings two huge trays of sliced raw beef. Steam 
               rises from the pot on the table.

               The song ends, and another Doors song comes on.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         They're not going to play the whole 
                         album, are they?

               They look across the table, over the steam and meat, at each 
               other- the whole thing is awful.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               INT.CHARLOTTE'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               In the darkness, under covers, Charlotte is woken up by a 
               loud fire alarm.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - NIGHT

               The fire alarm booms as the hotel guests and staff hurry out 
               of the hotel.

               Amidst the crowd of Hotel guests in their pajamas, Charlotte 
               finds Bob- he's wearing a kimono and slippers. She's in boxer 
               shorts and an undershirt and slippers.

                                     BOB
                         I'm sorry.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That lunch was the worst, huh.

               He laughs.

               She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel 
               slippers.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         When are you leaving?

                                     BOB
                         Tomorrow.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (friendly)
                         I'm going to miss you.

                                     BOB
                         That's what you said the other night.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well, I mean it more now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT

               and Charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual 
               spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake. She 
               lights two cigarettes and passes one to him.

               A NEW JAZZ BAND is now playing. The SINGER is full of 
               enthusiasm as they start their stint at the Park Hyatt.

                                     NEW SINGER
                         Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and 
                         we're thrilled to be joining you 
                         this week, here at the NY bar in 
                         Shinjuku.

               He sings "Where or When" with all his heart.

               Now, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other 
               and chuckle.

                                     SINGER
                         Jt seems we stood and talked like  
                         this before,   we looked at  each 
                         other in  the same way thenr   but  
                         I cant remember where or when...

               Bob and Charlotte sit there together.

                                     BOB
                         I don't want to go back tomorrow.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I know. But, it doesn't last, you 
                         have to go back sometime.

                                     BOB
                         Why can't it last?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         I don't know, it just doesn't, reality 
                         changes things....we can't stay here 
                         forever, unless maybe we started a 
                         Jazz band.

               (alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality 
               changes things...and we can't stay here forever)

               He looks over at her.

               The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there 
               together, the view sparkling.

                                     SINGER (O.C.)
                         Somethings  that happen for the first 
                         time,   seem to be happening again 
                         and so it  seems we have met before,   
                         and laughed before,   and loved 
                         before,   but who knows where or 
                         when...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         54?

               He nods, she pushes 54 for him and 56 for herself.

               They look at each other across the empty elevator, both 
               leaning against the walls.

               The elevator stops at 54, he leans in to kiss her good-night. 
               They kiss like you would on the cheek- but it's closer to 
               their mouths. The door shuts- he missed his floor.

               The elevator continues up, and stops on her floor. They kiss 
               good-night again and she gets out before the door closes.

               He watches the door close on her as she makes her way down 
               the long beige hall.

                                                                  FADE OUT:


               INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY

               A fax comes through the machine in the empty room.

               IT'S A NOTE AND CUTE DRAWING FROM JOHN -

               SEE YOU ON SATURDAY, I MISS YOU..."

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PARK HYATT LOBBY LOUNGE - DAY

               A sexy EXECUTIVE WOMAN asks Bob for a light. He looks at her 
               great legs as he lights her cigarette. He looks around, 
               keeping an eye out for Charlotte. The group of commercial 
               people arrive to see him off.

               He excuses himself for a moment and goes to a phone on a 
               little table in the corner.

               Bob picks up the house phone.

                                     RECEPTION (O.S.)
                         Hello? Yes?

                                     BOB
                         Hello, can I have room 5601.

                                     RECEPTION
                         One moment.

               Traditional Japanese music plays on hold.

                                     RECEPTION
                         I will connect you.

               Bob gets the room voice-mail.

                                     BOB
                         Uh...Hi, Charlotte... it's me, Bob... 
                         ok, I guess you're not there... wanted 
                         to say good-bye...

               He hangs up, feeling lame.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL RECEPTION -DAY

               Bob with his bags tries to call again. The commercial people 
               and hotel staff crowd around to help him, asking about his 
               stay.

                                     BOB
                         Charlotte?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Hi, Bob.

                                     BOB
                         I'm just leaving.... do you have my 
                         jacket?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.

                                     BOB
                         That'd be great.

                                     CHARLOTT
                         E Ok, see you in a second.

               A member of the hotel staff brings him an envelope on a little 
               silver tray.

               Miss Kawasaki gives him some gifts from their company in 
               traditional Japanese wrapping, he doesn't know what to do 
               with them and has to carry them.

               The Executive Woman from the bar walks up to him. He hangs 
               up the phone.

                                     BOB
                         0hr hi.

                                     EXEC WOMAN
                         You're leaving?

               She looks at him like, we could have had some fun.

                                     BOB
                         Yeah, yeah, I'm going.

               He sees Charlotte come out of the elevator.

                                     BOB
                         I have to go, thanks, bye.

               He rushes over to Charlotte. She looks at his bag.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Just saying good-bye to everyone 
                         before you leave?

                                     BOB
                         Yes, no.

               She hands him his jacket.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

               She waits for him to say something more. He wants to tell 
               her he loves her, that she should come with him.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         That's it?

               The concierge tells him his car is here.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         You're leaving right now?

                                     BOB
                         Yes.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                         Well... have a good flight.

                                     BOB
                         Thanks.

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (hurt)
                         Ok, bye.

               She walks away.

               A hotel manager asks Bob about his luggage, another asks if 
               he had a pleasant stay. Charlotte gets in the elevator to go 
               out, the doors close on her back.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARK HYATT - DAY

               It's bright outside the main entrance. A presidential pulls 
               up and the automatic door opens. Bob squints as the Bellboy 
               in white gloves slowly loads his luggage into the trunk.

               INT. CAR - DAY

               In the backseat, Bob leans back on the little doily.

               The car pulls away.

               Around the corner, he looks down a crowded alley and sees 
               Charlotte's blonde hair.

                                     BOB
                         Can you pull over a second?

               The DRIVER, wearing white cloth gloves, pulls the car over 
               slowly. Bob tries to open the door'99 it won't open, he has 
               to wait for the automatic doors to open for him (slowly).

               EXT. TOKYO STREETS - DAY

               Bob gets out and rushes down the street to where he saw 
               Charlotte. The street is crowded with JAPANESE PEOPLE, and 
               different colored umbrellas, (it's sunny out with a light 
               rain).

               Music blasts from speakers on the street, and there is some 
               promo going on with GIRLS handing out little cologne samples. 
               Bob looks around for her, but only sees dark hair, umbrellas, 
               and super tan JAPANESE KIDS.

               In the distance an umbrella moves to reveal Charlotte.

                                     BOB
                         CHARLOTTE!

               But she can't hear him over the loudspeaker. He rushes to 
               her.

               C.U. she turns and we see she is crying.

               The music swells. He embraces her, holding her close to him 
               in the crowd.

                                     BOB
                         Why are you crying?

                                     CHARLOTTE
                              (sincere)
                         I'll miss you.

               He kisses her, hugs her good-bye.

                                     BOB
                         I know, I'm going to miss you, too.

               He holds her close.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte watches Bob as he reaches his car, he turns and 
               looks at her.

               She smiles at him, and is lost in the crowd.

               Bob gets into his car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               Charlotte walks with the crowd as they go on their way.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - DAY

               Back in the Presidential, alone, Bob leans against the little 
               doily.  They drive off.

               He looks out the window, Bob's happy he's going home, he's 
               happy he came to Tokyo.

               Bob's P.O.V.-  Tokyo goes past his window.

                                                             FADE TO BLACK:

                                         THE END
Man on the Moon


      Man on the Moon (1999)
      by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski.


FADE IN:

INT. VOID - DAY

Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN, looking a bit
nervous.  Wide-eyed, tentative, he stares at us with a
needy, unsettling cuteness.  His hair is slicked-down, and
he wears the "FRIENDLY WORLD" costume from the Andy Kaufman
special.

Finally, Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Hallo.  I am Andy.  Welcoom to my
	movie.
		(beat; he gets upset)
	I hoped the story of my life would
	be nice...but it turned out
	terrible!  It is all LIES!  Tings
	are mixed up... real people I knew
	play different people.  WHAT A MESS!
	So I broke into Universal and cut
	out the junk.  Now it's much
	shorter.  In fact, this is the end
	of the movie.  So tanks for comink!
	Bye-bye!

Andy puts a needle on a phonograph, and swelling CLOSING
CREDITS MUSIC starts to play.  FINAL CREDITS roll.

Andy stands frozen, awkwardly looking at the audience.
Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and
restarts the music.  He does that as many times as the
credits require.

Finally, CREDITS END.  And then--a sly smile.  He leans in.
DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS.

		ANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)
	Okay!  Just my friends are left.  I
	wanted to get rid of those other
	people... they would have laughed in
	the wrong places.
		(beat)
	I was only kidding about the
	movie... it's actually PRETTY GOOD!
	It shows everything... from me as a
	little boy until my death --
		(his eyes pop; he
		covers his mouth)
	Oops!!  I wasn't supposed to talk
	about that!  Oh.  Eh, uh, we better
	just begin.  It starts back in Great
	Neck, Long Island...

Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on.
WHIR!  He smiles at the flickering light.

		ANDY
	Oh, yes.  I remember it well...

We PUSH INTO the white light.  It fills our frame, blazing
whiter, whiter...

				      DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. KAUFMAN HOUSE - 1957 - DAY

A BLACK AND WHITE image slowly becomes COLOR.  Great Neck,
1957.  An upper-class Jewish neighborhood.  In the street,
crewcut BOYS play t-ball, laughing and shouting.  A fat
convertible pulls up to the smallest house, and STANLEY
KAUFMAN, 40, gets out.  Still in his suit, he's a well-
meaning slave to his job -- tired, responsible.

Stanley goes over to admire the t-ball game.  At bat is his
son MICHAEL, 6, a natural charmer.  Michael swings -- crack!
-- and hits a solid single.  Stanley smiles.

		STANLEY
	That's my boy!  Good swingin',
	kiddo.
		(warm beat; then a
		look)
	Hey -- Michael... where's your
	brother?

		MICHAEL
	He's inside.

Instantly -- Stanley's mood turns black.  He frowns angrily,
then snatches his briefcase and marches in.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, KITCHEN - 1957 - DAY

Baby CAROL is crying.  Mom JANICE, 35, quickly peels
carrots, trying to get dinner made.  Stanley marches past.

		STANLEY
	Is he in his room?

		JANICE
	Of course he's in his room.
		(aggravated)
	All his "friends" are in there.

Stanley glowers.  He huffs upstairs.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, HALLWAY - 1957 - DAY

Stanley hurries up to Andy's shut door.  We hear little Andy
doing VOICES.

		ANDY (O.S.)
		(as WORRIED GIRL)
	But professor, why are the monsters
	growing so big?
		(now as BRITISH
		PROFESSOR)
	It's something in the jungle water.
	I need to crack the secret code.

Stanley rolls his eyes.  He opens the door...

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY

...revealing ANDY, 8, performing for the wall.  Andy is
happy and enthusiastic... as long as he's acting.

		ANDY
		(as BRITISH
		PROFESSOR)
	Maybe I should talk to the natives.
		(as dancing NATIVES)
	Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo
	ba --

		STANLEY
	Andy!

		ANDY
		(startled)
	Oh!

The boy suddenly turns off, becoming introverted... awkward.
Frustrated, Stanley stares at his son.

		STANLEY
	Andy, this has to stop.  Our house
	isn't a television station.  There
	is not a camera in that wall.

Andy glances over at the wall.  Hmm.

		STANLEY (cont'd)
		(trying to cope)
	Son... listen to me.  It isn't
	healthy.  You should be outside,
	playing sports.

		ANDY
	But I've got a sports show.
	Championship wrestling, at five.

		STANLEY
		(he blows his top)
	You know that's not what I meant!
	Look, I'm gonna put my foot down!
	No more playing alone.  You wanna
	perform, you GOTTA have an audience!

		ANDY
		(he points at the
		wall)
	B-but I have them.

		STANLEY
	No!  That is NOT an audience!  That
	is PLASTER!  An audience is people
	made of flesh!  They -- live and
	breathe!  Got it?!

Andy thinks, considering his options.  Then, he nods.
						CUT TO:

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, FAMILY ROOM - 1957 - LATER THAT DAY

Baby Carol sits in her crib.  Andy's hands suddenly YANK her
out.

INT. KAUFMAN HOUSE, ANDY'S ROOM - 1957 - DAY

Andy hurries in and plops Carol down on the floor.  She
dutifully sits there, deadpan.

Andy returns to the center of the room.  He resumes his
show.

		ANDY
		(as KIDDIE SHOW
		HOST)
	And now, boys and girls!  It's time
	for... TV Fun House!
		(he makes an
		APPLAUSE SOUND)
	Hi, everybody!  Are you ready for a
	singalong?  I'll say the animal, and
	you make his sound!  Okay...?  Okay!
		(he starts to SING)
	"Oh, the cow goes........."

Carol stares, unblinking.  Then --

		CAROL
	Moo.

		ANDY
		(he smiles, pleased)
	"And the dog goes......"

		CAROL
	WOOF!

		ANDY
	"And the cat says......"

				      DISSOLVE TO:

INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

TIGHT on ANDY, now GROWN UP.  26-years-old, still performing
the song.

		DRUNK AUDIENCE
	MEOW!!

WIDE - It's a small, hip New York nightclub.

		ANDY
	"And the bird says..."

		DRUNK AUDIENCE
	TWEET!!

		ANDY
	"And the lion goes..."

		DRUNK AUDIENCE
	ROAR!!

		ANDY
	"And that's the way it goes!"
		(he grins)
	Thank you.  Goodbye!

Andy waves and bows.  There's faint scattered applause.

Andy sighs.  An irritated MANAGER steps onstage.  He shoots
Andy a disgruntled look, then takes the mike.

		MANAGER
	The comedy stylings of Andy Kaufman,
	Ladies and Gentlemen!

In the b.g., Andy starts packing up his props: Hand puppets,
conga drums, a phonograph... it all goes into a big bulky
case.

					  CUT TO:

INT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT

The club is empty.  At the bar, the manager cleans up.  Andy
eagerly comes over.  Offstage, his presence is soft, placid
-- his voice barely above a whisper.

		ANDY
	So, Mr. Besserman, same slot
	tomorrow...?

		MANAGER
		(awkward)
	Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm...
	thinkin' of letting you go...

		ANDY
	You're firing me??
		(beat)
	You don't even pay me!

		MANAGER
	Look -- I don't wanna seem
	insulting.  But... your act is like
	amateur hour: Singalongs...
	puppets... playing records...

A stunned beat.  Andy is hurt.

		ANDY
	What do you want?  "Take my wife,
	please"??

		MANAGER
	Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the
	traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a
	little blue material...

		ANDY
	I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what
	everyone else does!

		MANAGER
	Well, everyone else gets this place
	cookin'!  Pal, it's hard for me to
	move the booze when you're singin'
	"Pop Goes The Weasel."

Andy stares, disheartened.
		   MANAGER (cont'd)
	I'm sorry.  You're finished here.

An uncomfortable beat -- and then Andy starts crying.

The manager is dumbfounded.  He doesn't know what to do.

Tears are rolling pitifully down Andy's cheeks.  The manager
is confused -- totally disoriented.  Shamed, Andy covers his
face, then runs out.  Silence.  The manager stares after
him... having no idea what just happened.

EXT. NY NIGHTCLUB - 1975 - NIGHT

Sobbing Andy bursts out the door.  He steps onto the
sidewalk -- and IMMEDIATELY STOPS CRYING.  Just like that.

Andy lifts his big case and starts walking.  Andy shakes his
head angrily.

He turns down a dark street, hurrying alone through an
unsavory New York neighborhood.  But then... TWO MEN
appear... silently approaching.  Andy stops uncertainly --
debating whether to turn around.  But in that second -- the
thugs are upon him, glaring menacingly.

		THUG #1
	Give us your wallet.

Andy stares fearfully.  An anxious moment.  He thinks...
considering his options.

Then, he suddenly stammers in a thick FOREIGN ACCENT.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	I -- doo not unterstand!!

		THUG #1
	Give us your money!

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	What??  What mooney?  Abu daboo!  I
	do not have mooney!

The thugs glance at each other.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	Pleaze!  I just move to America
	yezterday!  I do not know!

		THUG #1
	What's in the case?

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	NO!  Eeet, eet is just perzonal
	trifles from my homeland --

		THUG #2
	Shut up!  Gimme that thing!

The guy snatches the case.  He impulsively BREAKS the
lock... and clothes, congas and records fall out.

The thugs are dismayed.

		THUG #1
	Goddamn immigrants!

		THUG #2
	This guy's pathetic.  Let's go.

Harsh glances.  They angrily turn and leave.

Andy takes a nervous breath, then starts picking his things
off the street.  He shouts after the guys:

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Tank you veddy much...!

					 CUT TO:

EXT. NY IMPROV - 1975 - NIGHT

The Improv, the biggest comedy club around.  People are
lined up, waiting.  The man strides up -- GEORGE SHAPIRO, a
Hollywood talent manager.  George is old school: Bronx
accent, shmooze and a hug... but with a surprising sweetness
that is quite disarming.  A DOORMAN sees him, grins, and
waves George in.

INT. NY IMPROV, BAR - 1975 - NIGHT

The bar is packed with COMICS and SHOW BIZ TYPES.  A few
turn and smile -- "George!"  "Hey, George!"  George takes a
couple hands, whispers to someone else, then drifts into
the...

INT. NY IMPROV, SHOWROOM - 1975 - NIGHT

Where the show's in progress.  Owner BUDD FRIEDMAN sees
George and gives him a bear-hug.  Then he hustles George to
a table.

George sits -- and gives the stage his undivided attention.
Up there is a WISEASS COMIC.

		WISEASS COMIC
	So I'm getting my mother-in-law a
	special Christmas present: A pre-
	paid funeral!  The mortician asked
	me if I wanted her buried, embalmed
	or cremated.  I said, "Make it all
	three!  I'm not takin' any chances!"
		(the crowd LAUGHS)
	Thank you.  Good night!
The comic waves and exits.  APPLAUSE.  George politely
claps.  A PIANO PLAYER jumps in with an upbeat show tune.

We think there's a break... when Andy suddenly, awkwardly
steps on stage.  He is in character as Foreign Man.  Pink
jacket, tie, hair slicked back, frightened like a deer in
headlights.  He puts down his big case, pulls out various
junk, and arranges it on chairs.

The room hushes, uncertain as to who the hell this guy is.
Andy tentatively grabs the mike.  The stagefright is agony.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Now?  Now...?
		(looking around)
	Tank you veddy much.  I am very
	happy to be here.  I tink -- this is
	a very beautiful place.  But one
	ting I do not like is too much
	traffic.  Tonight I had to come
	from, eh, and the freeway, it was so
	much traffic.  It took me an hour
	and a half to get here!

Andy chuckles, as if this were a punchline.

Silence.  The crowd is baffled.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	But -- talking about the terrible
	things: My wife.  Take my wife,
	please take her.

Yikes.  A few NERVOUS LAUGHS.

Andy gestures, as if they got the joke.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	No really, I am only foolink.  I
	love my wife very much.  But she
	don't know how to cook.  You know,
	one time, she make a steak and
	mashed potato.  Ehh, and the night
	before, she make spaghetti and
	meatballs.  Her cooking is so bad...
	is terrible.

People are embarrassed.  Some avert their eyes.  A couple
hipsters laugh mockingly.

George leans forward.  Andy wipes the sweat from his brow.
		     ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	Right now, I would like to do for
	you some imitations.  So first, I
	would like to imitate Archie Bunker.
		(no change in his
		voice)
	"You stupid, everybody ees stupid!
	Ehh, get, get out of my chair
	Meathead... go in the, eh, Dingbat
	get into the kitchen, making the
	food!  Ehh, everybody ees stupid!  I
	don't like nobody, ees so stupid!"
	Tank you veddy much.
		(pleased, he proudly
		bows)
	Now I would like to imitate Jimmy
	Carter, the President of the United
	States.
		(no change in his
		voice)
	"Hello, I am Jimmy Carter, the
	President of the United States."

Some people BOO and walk out.  A few giggle, getting into
the groove.

George is intrigued.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	And now... I would like to imitate
	the Elvis Presley.

A woman LAUGHS caustically.  Andy grins stupidly, then turns
his back to us.  He presses "Play" on a CASSETTE RECORDER...
and the THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.

House lights dim dramatically.  With a flourish, Andy pulls
tape off his pants -- revealing rhinestones.  He removes his
pink coat -- putting on a white jeweled jacket.

He combs his hair.

Then he brushes his hair.

Then he combs his hair some more.

Finally he picks up a guitar, strikes a pose -- and spins
around.

He is ELVIS.  CONFIDENT.  SEXY.  LIP CURL.  DEAD-ON PERFECT.

The crowd is blown away.

Vegas Elvis INTRO MUSIC suddenly blasts.  Andy/Elvis
swaggers stage left and takes a bow.  Then he goes stage
right and takes a bow.  Then he returns stage left for
another bow.

Music STOPS.

		ANDY (AS ELVIS)
	Thank you very much.

Wow.  Flabbergasted, people APPLAUD.  This man is Elvis.

Suddenly -- "JAILHOUSE ROCK" guitar kicks in.

		ANDY (AS ELVIS) (cont'd)
		(SINGING)
	"Warden threw a party
	In the county jail!
	Prison band was there
	And they BEGAN to WAIL!"

ANGLE - GEORGE

He is astonished.  George cannot quite figure out what's
going on... but he wants in.

He waves Budd over.  Budd leans down, and George WHISPERS.

		GEORGE
	Pst.  What's the story with this
	guy?

		BUDD
	I think he's Lithuanian.  None of us
	can understand him.

George nods admiringly.

		GEORGE
	He does a hell of an Elvis.

					  CUT TO:

INT. NY IMPROV, BACKSTAGE - 1975 - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy is packing up his things.  He very methodically folds
each item of clothing, then checks the creases.

George strolls up.

		GEORGE
	Hey, I really enjoyed your set.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	Tank you veddy much.

		GEORGE
	So I understand you're from
	Lithuania?

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	No.  Caspiar.

George is puzzled.

		GEORGE
	Caspiar?  I haven't heard of that.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	It's a veddy small island in de
	Caspian Sea.
		(beat)
	It sunk.
		 GEORGE
	Oh.  Hm.  I'm uh, sorry.
		(beat)
	Well, look, I'm probably out of my
	mind -- but I think you're very
	interesting.  If you ever need
	representation... we should talk.

George hands him a BUSINESS CARD.  Andy reads it -- then his
eyes pop.  He DROPS the accent.

		ANDY
	Mr. Shapiro, it's an honor!!

George realizes it's all been an act.  He laughs heartily.

		GEORGE
	Caspiar, huh?!

					  CUT TO:

INT. SOHO HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A Bohemian health food restaurant, staffed by hippie
waitresses in sandals.  Andy and George sit together, trying
to get a sense of each other.

		ANDY
	You see, I want to be the biggest
	star in the world.

George is surprised at this hubris.

		GEORGE
	People love... comedians.

		ANDY
	I'm not a comedian.  I have no
	talent.
		(he shrugs)
	I'm a song-and-dance man.

George looks up at Andy -- and inexplicably there is a giant
MOIST BOOGER hanging from Andy's nostril.

George cringes.  He doesn't know what to say.

A waitress brings over two plates of awful 70's HEALTH FOOD
-- seaweed, beans, stringy paste.  George frowns.  Andy
beams.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Mmm!  I particularly recommend the
	Lotus root.

Andy pulls out a little Handi-wipe and cleanses his hands.
Then he starts arranging the food in compulsive little
piles: Beans in pinwheel shapes.  Sprouts in piles.

George peers at the bizarre food behavior.
		   GEORGE
	You show a lot of promise... but...
	my concern is I don't know where to
	book you.  You're not a stand-up...
	your act doesn't exactly translate
	to films... help me... where do you
	see yourself?

		ANDY
		(bright)
	I've always wanted to play Carnegie
	Hall.

George is unsure if that's a joke.

		GEORGE
	Yeah, ha-ha.  That's funny.

Andy dips his silverware in the water glass.  Two dunks,
then he dries it with his napkin.

George stares, perplexed.  He looks back up -- and Andy's
booger has suddenly switched nostrils.

Huh?

		ANDY
	See, I don't want easy laughs.

Andy's about to eat -- but first bows his head in silent
prayer.  George raises an eyebrow.  Andy snaps his head back
up.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I want gut reactions!  I want that
	audience to go through an
	experience.  They love me!  They
	hate me!  They walk out -- it's all
	GREAT!

Andy triumphantly eats a bean.  George peers, unable to take
the booger anymore.  He hands Andy a napkin and points to
his nose.  Andy nods, removes the rubber booger, and
carefully puts it in a little box.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	After I'm famous, I can sell these
	as "Worn by Andy Kaufman."

And at that... George is won over.  He smiles broadly.

		GEORGE
	You're insane.
		(then sincere)
	But -- you might also be brilliant.
	Alright, Andy... let's do it.

George warmly extends his hand.

Andy slowly smiles, then takes George's hand.  The men
shake.  A moment of supreme importance.
EST. BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

The glitz strip of Los Angeles.  Money.  Beauty.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

Real working showbiz offices.  No glamour at all.  It looks
more like an insurance agency.

George sits in his office, reassuring someone on the phone.

		GEORGE
	Sammy, opening for David Brenner is
	a fine gig.  You'll be on the
	road... get some exposure...

O.S., a SECRETARY shouts out.

		SECRETARY (O.S.)
	Tony Clifton on the phone!

		GEORGE
	Who?

		SECRETARY (O.S.)
	He says he's an associate of Andy
	Kaufman's.

		GEORGE
	Oh.
		(back to the phone)
	Sammy, think about it.  I gotta go.
		(he punches a line)
	Hello?  George Shapiro here.

On the phone, a STACCATO, ABRASIVE NASAL VOICE blares.

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	Uh, yeah.  Is this GEORGE SHAPIRO?

		GEORGE
		(beat)
	Er, yes.  Speaking.

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	"Speaking"!  Reeking, seeking,
	creaking... Freaking!

George is baffled.

		GEORGE
	Can I help you with something?

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy
	Kaufman, if you know what's good for
	you!

		GEORGE
		(stunned)
	Who is this?
		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	You -- you know damn straight who it
	is.  Tony Clifton!  A name to
	respect.  A name to fear.
		(beat)
	Beer.  Gear.  Deer.  Ear.

		GEORGE
	Look... I don't know what your
	problem is...

		TONY CLIFTON (V.O.)
	Kaufman's a lying bastard!  If you
	sign him, I'll RUIN YOU!

CLICK.  Clifton hangs up.  George is bewildered.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY

The light is magical.  Soothing SITAR music plays.  Andy and
fifteen other BAREFOOT STUDENTS sit on mats in a semi-
circle.  Eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they
are all meditating.

Facing them on a throne-like chair sits a reverent, Indian
YOGI.  At his feet is the class teacher, LITTLE WENDY, a
teeny lady with an absurdly high-pitched voice.

		LITTLE WENDY
	Now, while continuing your deep
	breathing, slowly open your eyes.
	You should feel rested, relaxed, and
	alert.

The students all open their eyes.

		YOGI
	Do any thoughts come...?

		STUDENT #1
	My mind is clear.  I feel great.

		YOGI
	Good...

		STUDENT #2
	All the tension is gone from my
	body.

The Yogi's eyes go to Andy.  Andy smiles sweetly.

		ANDY
	I want to thank you, your Holiness.
	My heart is radiating with pure
	energy.

The Yogi nods kindly.

		YOGI
	You always had a good heart.  But
	I'm proud of the progress you've
	made in your discipline.
		  ANDY
	Yes.  TM got me focused.  In fact,
	my manager got me a TV gig!  It's
	just some new show with no budget,
	but I'm still excited.

Oh.  The Yogi peers intently.

		YOGI
	Are you at peace with your family?

		ANDY
	Um, yes.  I haven't fought with
	them, since I started here.

		YOGI
	Goals are important.

		ANDY
	I stopped drinking.  I gave up
	drugs.  And I'm meditating three
	hours a day.  It's the center of my
	life...

		YOGI
	We are all impressed.

Andy smiles beatifically.  This means a lot.

		LITTLE WENDY
	Okay.  Anyone else --?

		ANDY
	Oh, wait!  I have a question.
		(beat; working up
		his nerve)
	Is there... is there a secret to
	being funny?

Huh?  The Yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face.
Then... he finally speaks.

		YOGI
	Yes.  Silence.

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

An AUDIENCE sits, waiting for the commercial to end.
TECHIES tweak lights.  CAMERAMEN get ready.

Sitting in VIP seats are Andy's FAMILY.  Stanley and Janice
are in their late 50's, Michael and Carol in their 20's.
They're all anxious.

		CAROL
	I still can't believe my brother's
	gonna be on TV...!

		JANICE
	I hope he doesn't get nervous.
		    STANLEY
	What's the difference?  This thing's
	on in the middle of the night -- no
	one's even gonna see it.

The commercial ends, and the "APPLAUSE" sign blinks.  The
crowd APPLAUDS.  An "ON THE AIR" sign lights up.

		HOST
	Welcome back to Saturday Night Live!
	And now, as a special treat on our
	first show... musical guest ANDY
	KAUFMAN!!!

The SNL orchestra starts the intro into a song.  Andy enters
the stage with a boom box, and positions himself in front of
the microphone.  When the vocals are supposed to start, Andy
doesn't open his mouth.  Instead he looks around --
frightened.  The band stops... and starts again.  Andy
remains mute.  The Band stops again.

INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT

The SNL producer, LORNE MICHAELS, looks worried.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	What's happening to him?

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

At that moment, Andy puts the boom box down and blares it
loudly.  The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" plays -- but Andy
just blankly stands there.

He's purposefully doing nothing.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)
	"Although we are in danger,
	 We never despair,
	 Because we know where there is
	danger
	 He is there!"

The audience is puzzled.  The Kaufmans are alarmed.

INT. SNL SET, BOOTH - NIGHT

Lorne Michaels is panicked.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	Oh my God, he's doing nothing.  It's
	dead air...!

INT. SNL SET - NIGHT

BACK ON ANDY.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.)
	"We're not worrying at all.
	 We're just listening for his
	call..."
Then SUDDENLY -- Andy comes to life and triumphantly LIP
SYNCS.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)
	"Here I come to save the day!"

Shocked, the crowd HOWLS with LAUGHTER.

Then instantly -- Andy resumes his blank expression.

		MIGHTY MOUSE THEME (V.O.) (cont'd)
	"That means that Mighty Mouse is on
	the way!"

The audience SCREAMS with glee.  The tune ENDS, and the
audience APPLAUDS CRAZILY.

Delighted, Andy grins and bows.

The Kaufmans clap the hardest.  Stanley locks eyes with
Andy... and the beaming father smiles the proudest of all.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George jumps from his desk.  Andy is walking in.

		GEORGE
	Andy, c'mon IN!  Thanks for flyin'
	out here!!

		ANDY
	The stewardess let me keep my
	headphones.

		GEORGE
	That's... terrific!  But I got
	something better.  This is BIG...
		(giddy; milking the
		moment)
	You are getting a once-in-a-
	lifetime, unbelievably lucrative
	opportunity to star on... a
	PRIMETIME NETWORK SITCOM!!!!

Andy's smile drops.  He freezes up.

		ANDY
	Sitcom...?

		GEORGE
	And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the
	guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore
	and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes
	place in a taxi stand!  And you're
	gonna be the Fonzie!

		ANDY
		(confused)
	I'm -- Fonzie?
		     GEORGE
	NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout
	character!  The guy that all the
	kids impersonate and put on their
	lunchboxes!

		ANDY
		(soft)
	George, I hate sitcoms.

		GEORGE
	HANG ON, you ain't heard the best
	part!  ABC has seen your foreign man
	character, and they want to turn him
	into --
		(he checks his
		notes)
	"Latka," a lovable, goofy
	mechanic!!!

Long pause.  Then -- Andy responds.

		ANDY
	No.

		GEORGE
	"No"?  "No" to which part??

		ANDY
	No to the whole thing.  None of it
	sounds good.

George is flummoxed.

		GEORGE
	Andy... this is every comedian's
	dream.

		ANDY
	I told you, I'm not a comedian.  And
	sitcoms are the lowest form of
	entertainment: Stupid jokes and
	canned laughter.

		GEORGE
		(shocked)
	B-but, this is classy... they did
	Bob Newha--

		ANDY
	I'm not interested.  I want to
	create my own material.

Beat.  George glares.

		GEORGE
	You have to do it.

		ANDY
	I refuse.

		   GEORGE
		(he explodes)
	LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've
	been in this business for twenty
	years!  I know!  If you walk away
	from this opportunity, you will
	never, NEVER see another one like it
	again!!!!

Long pause.  Andy stares at George, amazed at this passion.

Then Andy gets up and looks around the office.  He stares at
the awards... the gold records... emblems of success and
experience.

Andy thinks -- then nods.

		ANDY
	Okay.  Fine, I'll do it.
		(beat)
	But I have a few terms.

		GEORGE
		(relieved)
	Of course!  That's what negotiations
	are for.

Andy starts to write on a piece of paper.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	What are you doing?

		ANDY
	Writing down my terms.

George watches patiently.

Andy clicks his pen, done.  George smiles and takes the
list.  He scans it... then his face gets totally befuddled.

		GEORGE
	Are you makin' fun of me --?  This
	is RIDICULOUS!

		ANDY
		(blasй)
	Those are my terms.

		GEORGE
	They're IMPOSSIBLE!!  Jesus!
		(he points at one
		item)
	I mean -- "two guaranteed guest
	shots for Tony Clifton"??!  Who is
	this TONY CLIFTON?!

		ANDY
	He's a Vegas entertainer.  I used to
	do impressions of him.  We sorta...
	got in a fight over that.

George gets a look.

		GEORGE
	This Clifton called me up.  He's a
	loon!  He HATES you!
		     ANDY
	Nah, he just talks tough.  But I owe
	him one.

Andy smiles ingenuously, then turns stern.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	If I'm the new Fonz... ABC's just
	gonna have to give me what I want.
		(a sarcastic FONZIE
		IMPRESSION)
	Heyyyyyy!

George winces.  He stares at the list.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

George sits across a conference table from three NETWORK
SUITS.  He stoically reads the men his demands.

		GEORGE
	Mr. Kaufman will only appear in half
	the episodes.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman requires an undisturbed
	90 minutes of meditation prior to
	filming.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman won't rehearse.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman gets his own network
	Special.

The execs are stupefied.  Finally -- George delivers the
clincher.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	And Taxi must guarantee two guest
	appearances to... Tony Clifton.

		NETWORK GUYS
	WHO???

		GEORGE
	Tony Clifton.

		NETWORK GUY #1
	Who is he?!

		GEORGE
		(solemn)
	I don't know.

Long pause.  The execs stare at George like he's lost his
mind.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	But Andy says he's fabulous.
		(awkward)
	He also says, these are the terms.

The execs' leader, MAYNARD SMITH, shudders hopelessly.

		    NETWORK GUY #2
	Couldn't Kaufman ask for more money,
	like everyone else?

George slowly, sadly shakes his head:  No.

Maynard glances at his team -- then frowns.

		MAYNARD (cont'd)
	George, we don't book phantom
	performers.  The deal's off.

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

GEORGE throws his attachй case on the desk, then slumps into
his chair.  He picks up the phone and dials.

		GEORGE
	Andy?

		ANDY (O.S.)
	Hi George!

		GEORGE
	Eh, hi, Andy.  Look, this Tony
	Clifton... is he performing
	anywhere?

		ANDY (O.S.)
	Of course.
		(beat)
	But only on Monday nights.

		GEORGE
	That's alright.  Where...?

INT. MAMA ROMA'S - NIGHT

Mama Roma's, a dark Italian restaurant with red booths, wise
guys, and cigarette smoke.

The Maitre'd guides George to a booth.  A small BAND fills
the "stage" -- a six-foot space in the back of the room.

The lights dim.  A BLARING ANNOUNCER speaks.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And now, Mama Roma's is proud to
	present International Singing
	Sensation... a man who has sold more
	records than Elvis and the Beatles
	combined...

George is skeptical.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
	Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr.
	Entertainment... TONY CLIFTON!

The DRUMMER starts a drum roll.  Patrons APPLAUD.  A LIGHT
SPOT hits the entrance area... and nobody enters.  The spot
is waiting... waiting... still waiting... until the drum
roll slows down and stops.  The announcer BOOMS again.
		     ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (cont'd)
	Ladies and Gentlemen, out of respect
	for Mr. Clifton's vocal demands,
	could everyone please extinguish
	your cigarettes and cigars.

The crowd GRUMBLES angrily -- then irritably complies.  One
ANGRY GUY thrusts his cigar into a water glass.

		ANGRY GUY
	Goddamn, I paid five dollars for
	this.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And now!  A man who needs no
	introduction... TONY CLIFTON!

The band starts playing lounge standard "VOLARE".  And then,
obnoxious TONY CLIFTON swaggers out.  Tony has a rubbery
face, black wig and moustache, sunglasses, a padded belly,
and a peach tuxedo with blue shirt and velvet piping.

Tony stops, smirks at the audience, and sucks on a
cigarette.  He blows smoke rings at them.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Heh-heh.  How ya all doin'?

The crowd is furious.

		ANGRY GUY
	Fuck you!

People light back up and start talking.  Tony ignores the
ruckus.  He starts SINGING, pinched and off-key.

		TONY CLIFTON
		(singing)
	"Volare!
	 Whoa, whoa.
	 Cantare,
	 Whoa whoa whoa whoa."

George winces.  He's horrible.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
		(singing)
	"I got the wings of your love,
	 I got the wings of a dove.
	 I got the... uh...
		(forgetting the
		words)
	 ... the chicken wings from
	 Eh, Kentucky Fried..."

The band is lost.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	 Oh.  Whoop do doo,
	 Whoop de di,
	 Stick a needle in your eye...

The band gives up and stops.
		    TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Eh, the hell with that song.

One person CLAPS.  Most BOO.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	So how ya doin'!
		(leering)
	How ya doin' over here?  How ya
	doin' over there?
		(he approaches a
		WOMAN)
	How's that pasta carbonara?

		WOMAN
	Leave me alone.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Okay!
		(he spins around)
	So, you havin' a good time, sir?!

Tony approaches a LONELY SAD SACK sitting at the bar.  Tony
thrusts his mike at the guy.

		SAD SACK
	Sure...

		TONY CLIFTON
	What's your name?

		SAD SACK
	Bob.

		TONY CLIFTON
		(he reacts as if
		this is enormously
		funny)
	"Bob"?  BOB!  Bob bob bob.
		(beat)
	Bob what?

		SAD SACK
	Bob Gorsky.

		TONY CLIFTON
	"Gorsky"?  What is that, Polish?

		SAD SACK
		(meek)
	Yes.

Tony gets indignant.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Are you tryin' to do some of that
	Polack humor?  Well if that's so,
	you can just get the hell out of
	this restaurant!

		SAD SACK
		(timid)
	It's my name.

		TONY CLIFTON
	SHUT UP!  I hate them Polish jokes!

People are embarrassed.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	I do a clean show!  Like, I wouldn't
	do that one... oh, you know it...
	"What do you call a pretty girl in
	Poland"?

		SAD SACK
		(he giggles
		stupidly)
	A -- a tourist.

		TONY CLIFTON
	See, that's EXACTLY what I'm talkin'
	about!
		(enraged)
	Here!  I'LL give you a little humor!

Tony snatches Bob's water glass and POURS IT over his head!

George is appalled.  The crowd is aghast.  Bob is wet.
People BOO AND HURL THINGS.

Bob starts weeping, then bolts up and runs from the
building.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	And stay out, Fatso!

The room erupts, outraged.  George covers his face, looking
ill.  Suddenly, Tony snaps at him.

		ANDY
	And YOU.  I wanna see you backstage!

George is rattled.

INT. MAMA ROMA'S, KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

The kitchen staff is working.  George wanders around... then
finally spots Tony, back to us, eating pasta at the
employees' table.  Aggravated, George aggressively steps up.

		GEORGE
	Alright, I'm here.  What do you
	want?

Tony puts down his fork.  He pauses... slowly turns
around... and is Andy.

George GASPS.  His eyes bulge.

Andy smiles innocently.  He gestures to an empty seat.

		ANDY
	Are you hungry?

George is breathing heavily, like someone about to have a
heart attack.  His brain melting, he shakily reaches for a
chair and sits.  George glances down.  Lying alongside the
food is Tony's rubber face.

		GEORGE
	I... I-I don't understand this act.
		   ANDY
		(in jolly spirits)
	It's good old-fashioned
	entertainment.  Everyone loves a
	villain.

		GEORGE
	Yeah?  Well tell that to the poor
	schlub who you humiliated!

Beat -- then Bob strolls over.  His real name is BOB ZMUDA.

		ZMUDA
	Hey Andy, good show.

		ANDY
	Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob
	and I have been buddies for years.

George gapes.  On closer inspection, Bob is cocky, aloof,
and conniving.  He and Andy grin naughtily at each other.

		ZMUDA
	That was a really hot house!

		GEORGE
	So your name's not Gorsky.

		ZMUDA
	Don't believe everything you hear.

George thinks about this -- then laughs.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

Maynard and the ABC suits sit at the table, mesmerized.
George is confidentially whispering to them.

		GEORGE
	This has to stay in the room... but
	here's the thing: Andy is Tony.  And
	Tony is Andy!  They'll deny it up
	and down, but I swear to God,
	they're the same person!
		(with urgency)
	It's smart business!  You'll get two
	Andy Kaufmans for the price of one!

Maynard thinks about this, quite methodically.  A beat, and
then he cracks a smile...

INT. ALPHA BETA SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

1 a.m. in the supermarket.  Just a few people linger...
including Andy, who's at the Space Invaders videogame.  Andy
stares intently at the screen, eyes piercing, fingers
hammering the buttons while he blows up Martians.  Andy is
oblivious to all around him.

In the b.g., George suddenly enters.  He looks around the
market, then spots Andy.  He feverishly runs up.
		   GEORGE
	Andy!

		ANDY
		(still playing the
		game)
	What's up?

George grins crazily, ecstatically.

		GEORGE
	Andy... THEY SAID YES!  They agreed
	to it all!  They thought your terms
	were a shining example of your
	"irreverent wit" -- and precisely
	why they want you!
		(beat)
	You're getting EVERYTHING!

Whoa.  Andy looks up, astonished.  His space station
EXPLODES, but he doesn't notice.  He turns to George... and
slowly smiles sweetly.  Genuinely.

		ANDY
	Well thank you very much...!

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET - DAY

The first week of "TAXI."  The CAST rehearses on the Taxi
set.  PRODUCERS watch from the bleachers.

(The actual TAXI scene will be determined.)  JUDD HIRSCH,
TONY DANZA, and MARILU HENNER read their lines.

Then... a bored BLACK STAND-IN reads Latka's line.

The cast glances around.  Tony Danza loses his temper.

		TONY DANZA
	Man, this is bullshit!
		(he marches up to
		the PRODUCER)
	Where's Kaufman?  Why isn't he
	here??

One producer stands.  This is tightly-wound ED WEINBERGER.

		ED
	You'll see him on Friday when we
	shoot.  Now run the lines with
	Rodney.

An angry beat.  The actors resume...

INT. TAXI SET - DAYS LATER

The AUDIENCE is filtering in.  They fill the studio
bleachers.

INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

Actors mingle outside the dressing rooms.

		     JUDD HIRSCH
	I'm taking bets we do the show with
	the stand-in.

		MARILU HENNER
	No, I hear Andy arrived.  Rumor is
	he's locked inside his dressing
	room.

Judd is surprised.

INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Andy is meditating.  He's tranquil, at total inner peace.

Silence -- until a little clock radio CHIRPS.

Andy snaps his eyes open.  He exhales a few calm breaths,
then sits upright.  Andy reaches for a sealed envelope, rips
it open, and removes a SCRIPT.

Andy sighs, opens the script, and starts scanning the pages
like a speedreader.

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

Bleachers are full.  They're now filming TAXI (the same
scene as earlier).  On cue, Andy enters as LATKA -- wide-
eyed, endearing, in mechanic's overalls.

Andy is hilarious.  The crowd HOWLS with laughter.

MONTAGE - TAXI

In quick succession, a series of Andy's best Latka moments.
He's beloved.  The applause grows louder, louder, LOUDER...

INT. TAXI SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

TAXI curtain calls.  The whole cast takes bows, then runs
offstage.  Everyone is grinning -- except Andy.

He soberly strolls up to Zmuda.

		ANDY
	I'm gonna quit.

		ZMUDA
	What?!?

		ANDY
	Each show is worse than the next.

		ZMUDA
	Are you nuts?!  40 million people
	watch you every week!

		ANDY
	So?  What do they know?

		ZMUDA
	Absolutely nothing!  That's the
	beauty!
		(he lowers his
		voice)
	It's credibility.  You make them
	love you... and then later, on your
	special, you'll screw with their
	heads!

Hmm?!  Andy raises an eyebrow.
					 CUT TO:

INT. MAYNARD SMITH'S OFFICE - LA - DAY

The power office of Maynard Smith, the powerful ABC exec.
He shouts into a phone.

		MAYNARD
	I don't care!  Travolta signed a
	contract, he's a Sweathog for
	life!... Oh yeah?  Just try to sue
	us.

He HANGS up.  His ASSISTANT peeks her head in.

		ASSISTANT
	Sir, they're having a problem down
	on the Kaufman Special.  They say
	he's not following the... technical
	requirements.

Maynard is baffled.

		MAYNARD
	"Technical"???

INT. "KAUFMAN SPECIAL" SET, TECH BOOTH - SAME TIME

Andy is in a booth, arguing with a HEAVYSET TECHNICIAN.
Zmuda watches and eats a banana.

		ANDY
	It's my show!  Now make it roll!

		TECHNICIAN
	NO!

Maynard strolls up, buttoning his suit jacket, irritated as
he walks around Little Wendy meditating in front of a ring
of candles.

		MAYNARD
	Andy, I hear fabulous things about
	the Special...
		(a delicate pause)
	Eh, I understand we've hit a teeny
	speedbump?

		TECHNICIAN
		(harried)
	Yeah, Kid Genius told me to mess
	with the horizontal hold!  He wants
	the picture to roll!

Maynard doesn't exactly understand.

		MAYNARD
	Show me.

The technician pushes a button.  ON THE MONITOR - Andy's
image briefly appears.

			  ANDY (ON-SCREEN)
	And now... in her television debut,
	the incredible Chubby Rosalie!!

At that moment, Andy's image starts rolling across the
screen, until it disappears into a blur of static...

		ANDY
		(happy)
	It'll be great.  The viewer will
	think their TV is broken.  They'll
	get out of their chair, they'll
	twist the knobs, they'll hit the TV,
	but they won't be able to fix it!

Maynard stares at the monitor.  The totally indecipherable
picture still rolls.  A glum pause.

		MAYNARD
	Andy... we don't want the viewer to
	get out of their chair.  They might
	change the channel.

		ANDY
	But it's funny!  It's a practical
	joke.  They'll get frustrated!

Andy beams giddily.  Maynard gazes dully, struggling to
reason.

		MAYNARD
	Andy... uhh... this network has a
	long-standing policy: The viewer
	must be able to see the program.

		ANDY
	But it's only for thirty seconds!

Beat.

		MAYNARD
	Five.

		ANDY
	Twenty!

		MAYNARD
	Ten.

		ANDY
	Deal.

Both men quickly extend their hands and shake.  Maynard nods
and leaves.

Beat.  Then, Andy pulls out a Handi-wipe and cleans his
palm.

A STUDIO PAGE walks over.  He has a huge MAIL BAG.

		STUDIO PAGE
	Mr. Kaufman, do you want your mail?

Andy looks up -- and his face lights up like Christmas.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Andy's crappy apartment, which looks like a dorm room: Cheap
furniture, stained carpet, and a framed photo of the
Maharishi.  Andy lies on his bed, which is covered with
THOUSANDS OF LETTERS.  He happily chats on the phone.

		ANDY
	... Yes, it's Andy Kaufman!...
	Really! ...I got your fan letter...
	So you like the show?  Your letter
	said I was silly.  Did you think I
	was too silly?... Oh good.  I'm
	glad.

Andy holds a letter which has a GIRL'S SNAPSHOT stapled to
it.  He is very nervous.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	It was real nice of you to send your
	picture, Mimi... 'Cause you knew
	what I looked like... and now, I
	know what you look like!

Andy flips the letter over.  He glances at the return
address.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	So, um... San Bernardino...
		(beat)
	That's just a couple hours away,
	isn't it...?

EXT. SAN BERNARDINO, DOWNTOWN - DUSK

The sun is setting.  In an ugly shopping district, Andy
walks along with sexy, wholesome MIMI.

		MIMI
	... so after I finish junior
	college, I'll go to work for my
	dad's accounting firm.  Unless, I
	decide to live with my friend
	Valerie, but she wants to move to
	Anaheim, and I don't want to do
	that.

A disinterested beat.

		ANDY
	Oh.

Another beat.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	So do you wanna wrestle?

		MIMI
	Excuse me -- ?

ANDY
	Do you wanna wrestle?  It's a good
	way of breaking the ice.
		(pause)
	That instant physical intimacy
	really brings two people together.

Mimi is bewildered, and offended.

		MIMI
	What are you talking about?!  We
	just met an hour ago.

		ANDY
		(calm)
	No no no, it's not sex!  I mean --
	it can lead to sex... but really,
	it's just wrestling.

		MIMI
	I don't wanna talk about it!

An awkward silence.  They continue walking.  She points up.

		MIMI (cont'd)
	The sunset is really beautiful.

		ANDY
	What do you mean?

		MIMI
		(a bit offput)
	I mean -- uh -- the colors in the
	sky are so vibrant.  I love this
	time of day.

		ANDY
		(he shrugs dully)
	I've never understood that.  It's
	just... getting dark.
		(pause)
	But I like you!  Hey!  Why don't we
	fill the car with gas, drive to
	Tijuana, and GET MARRIED???

ANGLE - MIMI

Fear.  She shivers, then hoarsely speaks.

		MIMI
	I think I wanna go home.

INT. ABC CONFERENCE ROOM - LA - DAY

George screens Andy's TV Special for Maynard and his team.
The network execs look constipated.

ON THE TV - Andy speaks tenderly, lovingly to Howdy Doody.
		ANDY (ON TV)
	You know... I was once in your
	gallery.  I was just sitting there
	and I wanted to touch you.  I was
	kind of depressed because I could
	see what everyone was like, and I
	was wondering if, now, maybe I
	could... touch you.

Very gently, Andy touches Howdy's cheek and starts weeping.

THE EXECS -- are horrified.

	ANDY (ON TV)
	(cont'd)
Howdy, I've been
watching you ever
since I was a little
boy...
    (choked up,
    nervous)
You're the first
friend from television
I ever had.  I always
wanted to meet you...
and now ...I finally
am.

				     EXEC #2
			 This is NOT funny.

				     EXEC #3
				(ominous)
			 "Artsy Fartsy shit"...

				     GEORGE
				(worried at this
				response)
			 No... eh, the Special
			 isn't all like this...
			 just wait... it will be
			 hysterical.

At that moment, the picture turns to FUZZY SNOW.  Maynard
scowls.

		MAYNARD
	Christ!  We're the Number One
	Network -- can't we afford decent
	TVs?!

Maynard angrily jumps and POUNDS on the TV.  BANG, BANG!
George winces -- then mutters awkwardly.

		GEORGE
	No, um... it's part of the snow.

An awful beat.

Maynard is embarrassed.  Finally -- he explodes.

MAYNARD
	Tell Kaufman we will NEVER air this
	program!!

INT. JERRY'S DELI - NIGHT

A delicatessen.  Andy wears an apron and angrily cleans
tables.  He stacks dirty dishes and wipes up the food.  Two
BLUE COLLAR GUYS gesture from a booth.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 1
	Excuse me, could I please have more
	coffee?

		ANDY
	Yeah, yeah, in a sec'.
		(he lugs the dishes
		to the kitchen)
	That was decaf, right?

The guy nods.  Andy hurries over with the coffeepot and
starts pouring.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 1
	You know, you look just like Andy
	Kaufman.

		ANDY
	Yeah, I get that all the time.

Andy hurries off.  The guy's buddy leans in, whispering.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 2
	I'm telling you, it's him.

		BLUE COLLAR GUY 1
	You wanna bet??  If that was him, he
	wouldn't be workin' here, pouring my
	coffee!

NEAR THE KITCHEN

Andy dumps out wet coffee grounds.  He is sweating.  In the
b.g., George enters the restaurant.  He sees Andy, sits at a
table and YELLS OUT.

		GEORGE
	Hey!  Could you clear this table and
	bring me a piece of poundcake?

Andy turns.  They stare down each other.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Andy, this is ridiculous.  Take off
	that apron.

		ANDY
		(infuriated)
	NO!  I'd rather work here, than at
	ABC.  There's no lying in a
	restaurant.  They don't promise you
	a job as a cashier, then suddenly
	make you a frycook!

Andy hurries off with a water pitcher.  George chases him.
		GEORGE
	Look, I'm sorry.  They're assholes!
	But we work in a creative business.
	You can't predict what people are
	gonna like --

		ANDY
	The ONLY reason I did Taxi was so I
	could have my own Special!

		GEORGE
		(trying to calm him)
	Tell you what.  I'll book you on
	some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll
	show the Special around... see if
	somebody wants to buy it --

		ANDY
		(bitter)
	Yeah, we can have a garage sale.
	"Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a
	network TV Special for only fifty
	cents!"

A glum moment.

Andy fills water glasses.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	How long is left on my Taxi
	contract?

		GEORGE
	You signed for five years --
		(awkward)
	So four years, seven months.

		ANDY
		(he looks up)
	Okay... I'll go back.  But just let
	them know, first they ain't gettin'
	Latka.  They're gettin' Tony!

a gigantic presence to these people.

Andy smiles and bows.

	Thank you.  It's great to be here.
	We're going to have a very nice

Andy reacts, perturbed.  He struggles to stay composed.

	Uh, we'll play with puppets --

Andy scowls.  Then -- he loses it.

		ANDY

Zmuda is with the congas and props.  Andy runs up.

		ANDY
	Give me the book.

		ZMUDA

	No!  Andy, don't do it --

		ANDY
	They're asking for it.

Andy fiercely GRABS a small book from Zmuda.  Zmuda cringes.

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

Andy strides back out.  He gazes at the crowd.

		ANDY
	Since you're such a special
	audience... I'm going to reveal, for
	the first time ever, the real me.
		(he goes into a
		CLIPPED BRITISH
		ACCENT)
	I'm actually British.  I was raised
	in London and educated at Oxford.
	And though I dabble in clowning, I
	do find it so boorish.  So...
	American.
		(beat)
	I prefer the fine arts.  Henceforth,
	tonight,  I'd like to grace you with
	a reading of the greatest novel ever
	written!

	"The Great Gatsby", by F. Scott
	Fitzgerald!!

Heh?  The crowd isn't quite clear if this is good or bad.  A
confused murmur.

		book)
	Chapter One.
		(he starts READING)
	"In my younger and more vulnerable
	years, my father gave me some advice
	that I've been turning over in my
	mind ever since.  'Whenever you feel
	like criticizing anyone,' he told
	me, 'just remember that all the
	people in this world haven't had the
	advantages you've had.'"

There's a little NERVOUS LAUGHTER.  Is he really gonna read
this?

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	"He didn't say any more, but we've
	always been unusually communicative
	in a reserved way, and I understood
	that he meant a great deal more than
	that..."

Suddenly, somebody from the audience screams:

		FRAT BOY IN AUDIENCE
	LATKA!!!

The audience ROARS approvingly.  Andy stops reading and
looks at the student.  He smiles.

		ANDY (AS LATKA)
	Tank you veddy much!!!!

The audience APPLAUDS enthusiastically.  Andy waits until
the applause dies and goes back to the book.

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	"When I came back from the East last
	autumn, I felt that I wanted the
	world to be in uniform and at a sort
	of moral attention forever; I wanted
	no more riotous excursions with
	privileged glimpses into the human
	heart..."

People start BOOING.  Andy looks up.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	Please, let's keep it down.  We have
	a long way to go.
		(he resumes reading)
	"Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
	name to this book, was exempt from
	my reaction - Gatsby, who
	represented everything for which I
	have an unaffected scorn..."

The crowd is incredulous.

The clock says 11:30.  The PROMOTER glares at Zmuda.

		PROMOTER
	Is he ever going to stop?

		ZMUDA
		(dour)
	Sure.  When he reaches "The End."

INT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

People are streaming out.  Maybe fifty are left.  Andy
realizes this -- but is committed.  He must continue.

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	"Tom was evidently perturbed at
	Daisy's running around alone, for on
	the following Saturday night he came
	with her to Gatsby's party.  Perhaps
	his presence gave the evening its
	peculiar quality of
	oppressiveness..."

A weak VOICE feebly shouts:

		WEAK VOICE
	Do Latka.

Andy looks up, shocked.  Insulted, he "blows his temper."

		ANDY (BRITISH)
	Look!  I don't have to tolerate this
	impoliteness!  Forget it -- I'm
	gonna stop the show.  GOODBYE!

He slams the book shut.  People CHEER.  Andy starts to storm
off -- then turns.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	No, no, I'm only fooling.

The audience GROANS.

		ANDY (BRITISH) (cont'd)
	I'll tell you what.  Would you
	rather have me continue reading or
	would you like to hear the
	phonograph record?

The audience ROARS for the record.  Andy smiles, puts the
needle on and to everyone's horror more "Gatsby" comes out.
		ANDY (BRITISH-FROM THE RECORD)
	"His presence gave the evening its
	peculiar quality of oppressiveness -
	it stands out in my memory from

Andy somberly shuts the book.

A moment of quiet personal euphoria.  Andy looks enraptured,
the man who has just climbed Everest.

A pause -- but no applause.  It's dead silence.  Andy looks
out... and realizes the few audience members are asleep.

Andy shrugs, then shuffles off-stage.

In the wings, Zmuda snores loudly in a folding chair.

EXT. COLLEGE AUDITORIUM - DAWN

Andy and Zmuda walk out, Zmuda squinting groggily.  They
drag the suitcase containing the props.  They walk slowly

	There were three-hundred walkouts!
	The promoter wants a refund!

Andy mumbles in a pipsqueak whimper.

		ANDY
	I'm sorry, George...

		GEORGE
	You're DAMN RIGHT you're sorry!

	And you -- you're the road manager!

	first time with a prostitute.

		MADAM
		(mocking)
	What're you talking about?  Andy
	comes here almost every weekend.

Zmuda's jaw drops, stupefied.

		ZMUDA
	You're talking about... Andy?

		MADAM
	Oh, he doesn't always call himself
	that.  Sometimes he's Tony, and
	wears a tux.

Disbelief -- then Zmuda LAUGHS sharply.  He's been conned.

INT. MUSTANG RANCH, BEDROOM - DAY

Andy and the two hookers are WRESTLING.  They grapple and
roll around, all three of them in their underwear.

Suddenly Andy flips the girls over and pins them with his
arms.

Breathing hard, he stares down.

		ANDY
	You let me win.

		HOOKER
		(she giggles sexily)
	What if we did...?!

Andy grins and leans down...

		ANDY
	Hey.  If I give you three-hundred
	dollars, will you come to LA and
	help me destroy a TV show?

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET, REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

The Taxi cast sits irritably around a big table, holding
scripts.  Ed Weinberger enters.

		TONY DANZA
	Where is he?

		ED
	He just arrived.

		CAROL KANE
	He's an hour late.

		ED
	Look, I'm told this Clifton guy is a
	little eccentric.  You're all just
	gonna have to roll with the punches
	this week.

Suddenly -- the door SLAMS open.  Tony bounds in, filthy
drunk, clutching a bottle in a brown bag.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Taxi!  Laxy!  Just the factsy,
	Maxie!  Them's all the words that
	rhyme with taxi!... Right, girls?

Little Wendy and the Hooker sashay in, dressed as tarts.
Tony feels them up, and they SQUEAL.  The cast stares in
horror.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Eh, why the blue faces?  You musta
	read the script!
		(he chuckles)
	Well, don't worry!  Your pal Tony
	stayed up all night, writin' some
	fixes on it.
		(he pulls out some
		SCRIBBLED PAGES)
	I added me a musical number, cut out
	Judd Hirsch, and changed the
	location to Mardi Gras!

Ed's expression goes ashen.

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

An attempted rehearsal.  Tony is tap-dancing on top of a car
hood.  He does a "fancy" move, and his booze bottle suddenly
flies away and CRASHES against the wall.

The cast watches, pissed and bored.

		TONY CLIFTON
	And now, the new theme song!
		(he starts SINGING)
	"Oh yes, we drive a taxi,
	 And we're havin' fun.
	 Yeah, we work together,
	 And we get the freakin' job done."

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY

Beleaguered Ed sits with George.

		ED
	George, we've lost two days.
	Filming is on Friday.  We HAVE to
	let him go!

		GEORGE
		(worried)
	I'm not sure how Andy's gonna take
	this...

		ED
	So we'll go downstairs and tell him!

He points at Tony, swaggering around on the set.  George
shakes his head.

		GEORGE
	But that's Tony down there.  That's
	not Andy.  Trust me, it's like
	"Sybil" -- Andy's nowhere on the
	premises!

Ed glares.

		ED
	Well whoever the fuck that is, I'm
	firing him!

		GEORGE
		(he sighs)
	Okay.  But we'll have to warn Andy
	first.  I think he's up in San
	Francisco, doing a concert.

Heh?  Ed raises his eyebrows.

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - SECONDS LATER

George is on the phone.  Ed hovers.

		GEORGE (INTO PHONE)
	Hi, Diane, this is George.  I'm
	trying to reach Andy up in San
	Francisco.
		(a stilted pause)
	Yeah, I'll wait.

Ed glances down at the stage... and suddenly Tony is no
longer there.  He's magically vanished.

Beat.

George turns on the SPEAKERPHONE, then CLICK!  Andy's happy
voice pops on the line.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Hi, George!  Good to hear from you!

		GEORGE
	Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up
	there?

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always
	foggy!

Ed looks totally off-balance.  George winks at him.

		GEORGE
	I'm here with Ed over at Taxi.
	There's been some trouble with Tony.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Oh no!  Did he get hurt?

		ED
	No, no, Andy, nothing like that.
		(nervous beat)
	But... Tony's not fitting in.  His
	style of performance is too...
	burlesque.

					INTERCUT:

INT. TAXI SET, ANDY'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Tony is on the phone.  Little Wendy is busily refilling his
whiskey bottle with canned ice tea.  He looks up, insulted.

		TONY CLIFTON (AS ANDY)
	"Burlesque"?

					 BACK TO:

INT. TAXI SET, TECH BOOTH - DAY

		ED
	Andy, I'm calling you up like this
	because I have the utmost respect
	for your artistry.  But -- I need
	your permission to fire him.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Oh dear!
		(upset)
	George, this is gonna kill Tony.
	He's waited his whole life for this
	break.

		GEORGE
	There'll be other shots.

		ED
	Andy, I have to do it.  He's a
	terrible actor.

Andy thinks about this.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	I guess I understand.  But Ed --
	please... let him down gentle.

		ED
	Yes, Andy, I will.

Andy hangs up.  A relieved Ed turns to George.

		ED (cont'd)
	Thank you.

					  CUT TO:

INT. TAXI SET - LATER THAT DAY

Tony SCREAMS insanely.

		TONY CLIFTON
	FUCK YOU!  I AIN'T GOIN'!!

WIDE

Ed is stupefied.  The cast stands nervously behind him.

		ED
	We had a deal!!

		TONY CLIFTON
	I don't know what yer talkin' about.
	You musta talked to someone else --

		ED
	Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!

		TONY CLIFTON
	I don't know nothin' about no
	Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my
	coattails, smearing my reputation.
	Been usin' my good name, to get
	places.

Ed is livid.  He gazes harshly at Tony -- Tony's burning
eyes piercing through the rubber features.

		ED
	Get off my stage!  You're fired!

		TONY CLIFTON
	I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take
	you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!

Suddenly -- FLASH!  Ed looks over.  A REPORTER has a camera.

		ED
	Who're YOU?!

		REPORTER
	I'm from the LA Times.  We're doing
	a little puff piece on Mr. Clifton.
		(beat)
	Mr. Kaufman arranged it.

UP IN THE BLEACHERS - George enters.  He looks down at the
growing debacle, and winces.  Uh-oh.

ONSTAGE - Enraged, Ed blows up.

		ED
	Security!  Escort this man off the
	lot!!

ONSTAGE - Studio SECURITY GUARDS run over.  They GRAB Tony.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Stop!  GETCHER HANDS OFF ME!

Tony scuffles.  The camera FLASHES.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	LEMME GO!  I'M A BIG STAR!

IN THE BLEACHERS - George stares at this mess... and starts
giggling.

ONSTAGE - Two guards drag Tony to the door.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	You'll be SORRY!  One day I'm gonna
	OWN this town!!

Tony SCREAMS and gets removed.  Dead silence.  Then --

		ED
	I don't want those pictures getting
	out.

		SECURITY GUARD
		(to the reporter)
	This is a closed set.  You'll have
	to give me the film in that camera.

The Guard reaches for the camera.  An uncertain moment...
until Zmuda authoritatively cuts in, from out of nowhere.

		ZMUDA
	I'll take care of this.

Zmuda takes the camera.  He casually starts to make his way
for the exit... when Ed suddenly HOLLERS.

		ED
	Wait -- he's one of THEM!

Zmuda gasps.  Two guards go running for him.

Zmuda barrels away, trying to escape.  The guards chase.
Zmuda races by George, and suddenly palms off the camera
into George's arms.  The guards whip by, oblivious.

George grimaces, unclear about his loyalties.  He sweatily
peers at the timebomb in his hands.

And then -- George thrusts it under his jacket.  He bolts
for the door and feverishly scampers out.

EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY

George runs for his life.  He knocks aside a rack of
costumes and serpentines between people.

At the gate, Tony's being dragged, kicking and screaming.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Stop!  HELP!  You wouldn't do this
	to Wayne Newton --

The guards toss Tony out the gate.  He lands in a heap.

In the b.g., George crazily flies by.  He gets out the exit.

EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT, OUTSIDE THE GATES - DAY

George doubles over, trying to catch his breath.  He glances
down... and Tony is lying next to him.  Little Wendy and
Zmuda run up, out of breath.

They all look at each other.  There's a moment of
understanding.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Hey.  Good hustlin'.

George slowly smiles.

INT. TAXI OFFICES - SAME TIME

Ed storms in, insanely angry.

		ED
	That asshole!  That FUCKING
	BASTARD!!
		(he SLAMS the door
		behind him)
	We had a fuckin' deal, and THAT
	COCKSUCKER SHAFTED ME!!

Ed is seething.  His SECRETARY timidly speaks.

		SECRETARY
	Um, Ed... you have a phone call --

		ED
	I'M NOT IN!

		SECRETARY
	Well, um... it's Andy Kaufman...

Heh??!  Shaking with fury, Ed stares at the telephone...
then slowly picks it up.

		ED
	Yeah???

A long pause... then Andy's voice calmly speaks.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	You were brilliant.

A flabbergasted beat.

		ED
	Huh?

		ANDY (V.O.)
	You were in the moment.  You became
	a producer losing his mind.
		(sincerely joyful)
	It was the best improv I've ever
	seen.

TIGHT - ED

He thinks intently about this.  And then... amazingly, a
magnificent smiles comes over his face.

		ED
	Well -- thank you.

Pause.

		ANDY (V.O.)
	Okay.  See you next week.

Andy hangs up.  Ed just sits there, astounded.

					  CUT TO:

INT. LA HEALTH FOOD RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Andy, Zmuda, George and Little Wendy are squeezed in a
booth, laughing and celebrating.  They eagerly read the LA
Times.

INSERT - The headline says "WHO IS TONY CLIFTON?"  Below is
a PHOTO of Tony being thrown off the Taxi set.

They all HOWL.

		ANDY
	This is great!  It makes Tony REAL -
	- three-dimensional!  It's very good
	for his career.

Zmuda reads one paragraph.

		ZMUDA
	"Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman?
	And if it was Andy Kaufman, is Andy
	Kaufman crazy?"

		ANDY
		(he chortles)
	Boy, they totally fell for it!  I'm
	only acting crazy!

Hmm.  A few awkward glances.

Then -- Andy grins at his meal.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Boy, this is tasty.

		WAITER)
	Hey, can I please have some more
	seaweed?!

INT. BOOKER'S OFFICE - DAY

A slick BOOKER, sitting in a crowded office full of head
shots.  He's on the phone.  He's reading the LA Times story.

		BOOKER
	Mr. Shapiro, this is Gene Knight, up
	at Harrah's Tahoe.  We'd like to
	book Andy Kaufman for our showroom.

					INTERCUT:

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

George on the phone.

		GEORGE
	Ehh -- Andy doesn't really like
	playing casinos.  The audiences
	don't work well for him.

		BOOKER (O.S.)
	Oh.

Disappointed beat.  The booker thinks.

		BOOKER (O.S.) (cont'd)
	What about Tony Clifton?

		GEORGE
		(startled)
	Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to
	headline Harrah's Tahoe??

		BOOKER (O.S.)
		(being tricky)
	Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand
	our audience base -- and I know the
	college kids really love Andy
	Kaufman.

George winces.

		GEORGE
	Look -- I gotta be clear with you.
	Tony Clifton is NOT Andy Kaufman.

		BOOKER (O.S.)
	Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!
		(he LAUGHS merrily)
	Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!

		GEORGE
		(frustrated)
	No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony,
	do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.

		BOOKER (O.S.)
		(LAUGHING harder)
	I'll take my chances!!

George rolls his eyes in annoyance.  Finally, he shrugs.

		GEORGE
	Fine, be my guest!  Book him.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

George is driving in his convertible.  Suddenly, something
catches his eye -- and in shock he HITS the brakes.  Three
cars behind him SCREECH crazily, trying not to hit each
other.

George is oblivious.  He's staring up at a BILLBOARD.
The BILLBOARD: It says "HARRAH'S TAHOE PRESENTS, ANDY
KAUFMAN & TONY CLIFTON!  TOGETHER ON STAGE!  ONE NIGHT
ONLY!"

George is flabbergasted.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD, PHONEBOOTH - DAY

George is shouting into a payphone.

		GEORGE
	Gene, you misunderstood!!  You're
	not getting BOTH of them!
		(upset)
	It's physically impossible!

		BOOKER (O.S.)
	Why's that?  You said over and over
	and over, Tony Clifton is not Andy
	Kaufman --

		GEORGE
	Yeah, I KNOW what I said!  But --
	trust me, it's not gonna happen!

		BOOKER (O.S.)
	Sure it is.  Tony called me himself.
	He yelled at me, insisting that his
	dressing room be bigger than Andy's.
	They're both going on tonight,
	believe me!

George is stupefied.  He looks at his watch.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. LAKE TAHOE - DUSK

Magnificent HARRAH'S dominates the skyline.  The marquee
blares "TONY CLIFTON AND ANDY KAUFMAN!"  George screeches up
in a rental car.  He jumps out and runs inside.

INT. HARRAH'S SHOWROOM - NIGHT

The showroom is packed.  It hums with curiosity.  WAITERS
clean off the dinner tables.  George rushes in and is seated
in a far booth, with some STRANGERS.  He overhears a heated
conversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE.

		PUSHY MAN
	You're not listenin'!  It's a VERY
	simple concept.

		WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
	You're making no sense.  How can
	they be the same person --?

		PUSHY MAN
	Trust me!  You'll never see them on
	stage at the same time!

The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare.  LIGHTS DIM.  Sharp
SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage.  Suddenly -- Tony
swaggers out, hands over his head in a gesture of triumph.

Thunderous APPLAUSE.  Tony beams.  The music stops.

George leans in, curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of
this.

Tony bows theatrically, turns back to face the orchestra,
and waits.  The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not
entirely.  Tony waits, and waits, and waits... until
suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS
FURIOUSLY.

		TONY CLIFTON
	SHUT UP!!!!!!

Everybody looks up, alarmed.  The general murmur almost
dies.  Tony stands there, eyes flashing with anger at all
the unruly people.  As they quiet down... Tony turns back to
the orchestra and raises his arms.  The MUSICIANS lift their
instruments.  Silence is total -- except for the clank of
china.

Waiters are serving coffee.

Tony spins back around, livid.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	THAT APPLIES TO YOU, TOO,
	PENGUINS!!!

People signal "shh"!  The waiters realize Tony's addressing
them, and they stare back in disbelief!  This is their job!

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Yeah!  Yeah!  YOU!  I'm talkin' to
	YOU!!  And you better freeze, or
	I'll get your asses fired!!!

Tony's outburst is so commanding that they all freeze.  The
waiters stand there like statues, staring in terror.

Satisfied, Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his
arms.  Again, the musicians lift their instruments.  In
anticipation of loud music, the waiters start moving about.
Audience members start whispering.  Tony hears this -- and
drops his arms and head in despair.

The musicians lower their instruments.  Tony waits for
absolute silence.  Only then does he signal the musicians to
get ready again.  They do.  And then at that precise moment
-- somebody DROPS a spoon.
Tony jolts, as if hit by a current.  He drops his hands
again, turns, and gives the perpetrator a murderous look.
Then he turns again, lowers his head, and waits.  And waits.
And waits.

The man at George's table WHISPERS to his wife.

		PUSHY MAN
	He's never gonna start!  Kaufman
	thinks this is funny!
		(beat)
	We've paid forty bucks for a show
	that's never gonna start!

George grins stupidly.  The silence is now deafening.
Slowly, very slowly, Tony raises his arms.  Slowly... the
musicians get their instruments ready.  Tony stands there,
and stands, and stands, waiting for something... anything...
to disturb the silence.  In vain.  Somebody COUGHS.  The
whole scene repeats itself.

Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence.
Then, (only a moment before the length of this scene would
become unbearable), he begins to move.  Tony pivots around,
looks at the audience...

And the entire room looks like Tussaud's Wax Museum.  Tony
starts LAUGHING hysterically.  The audience's reaction is
mixed:

Some people LAUGH.  Some BOO.  Some ask perplexed questions.
Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES.  Some even APPLAUD.

Tony is very happy.  He turns to the orchestra, raises his
baton -- and commences the downbeat!  The MUSIC BEGINS.

A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings... and then ANDY STRIDES OUT.

George's jaw drops.

		WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
	You see!  I told you!  They're not
	the same person!

The whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE.  Life is back to
normal.  Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a
prepared row of congas.  He starts to play.

Tony Clifton grabs the microphone.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Thank you!  Thank you!  I wrote this
	tune for my friend Frank Sinatra.
	He had a nice little success with
	it... but forgot to thank me on the
	album.

He starts to BELT "I Gotta Be Me".

George squints his eyes, trying to figure out who this is.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"Whether I'm right
	 Or whether I'm wrong
	 Whether I find a place in this
	world
	 Or never belong!
	 I gotta be me!  I gotta be me!
	 What else can I be, but what I am?"

Tony's singing is awful.  Andy happily accompanies on
congas.  The audience doesn't know what to think.

Tony's SINGING reaches the end... aggressive and off-key.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Let's bring it on home --
		(he hits his
		screeching CLIMAX)
	"I GOTTA BE MEEEEEE!"

The BAND ends with a brassy punch.  The crowd responds with
LOUD BOOING.

					  CUT TO:

INT. HARRAH'S, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

George wanders the corridor, looking for the dressing rooms.
He turns and finds a door marked "KAUFMAN".  Next to it is a
door marked "CLIFTON".

George stares.  He thinks, then opens the "KAUFMAN" door.

Andy is inside alone, gathering his things.  He's pleasantly
surprised to see George.

George doesn't enter.  He goes to the "CLIFTON" door.  Andy
follows.  George opens the mystery door...

INT. HARRAH'S, CLIFTON'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

and inside, taking off the rubber Tony makeup, is Zmuda.

George starts hyperventilating.  Shaking, he tries to sit
himself down.  Andy enters, beaming.  George is amazed.

		GEORGE
	You're so proud.  You're like some
	retarded kid comin' home from
	school: "Look, Dad, I got an F!"

		ANDY
	But wasn't it funny?

		GEORGE
	"Funny"?  I dunno.  But
	"intriguing"... "mindboggling"...
	perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.
		(softening)
	Like, that moment, when you both
	came onstage...

Andy excitedly jumps up and down.

		ANDY
	Uh-huh!  See, with all these
	articles, people think they're
	insiders.  They see Tony Clifton,
	and they say, "Ah, that's really
	Andy Kaufman."  But that spoils it.
	So NOW, Tony denying being me is the
	truth!  Tony's not me!  But maybe he
	is!  The audience will never know...
		(giddy)
	They'll think they're laughin' at me
	-- but actually I'll be laughin' at
	them, because they're wrong and I'm
	right!

George is dazed.

		GEORGE
	So you've got this big elaborate
	joke, which is really only funny to
	two people in the universe.
		(dry)
	You... and you.

		ZMUDA
	Sure!  But WE think it's kickass!
	Now I get to be Tony.  I get to dump
	the glass of water on someone else's
	head!

		GEORGE
		(he turns serious)
	But what's the POINT?  How will any
	of this make you the biggest star in
	the world?

Hmm.  Andy contemplates this.

		ANDY
	George... I'm at a stage where the
	audience expects me to constantly
	shock them.  But short of faking my
	death, or setting the theater on
	fire, I don't know what else to do.
		(thoughtful)
	'Cause I've always got to be one
	step ahead of them.

		GEORGE
	But I feel you're extending this
	philosophy to real life.  It's
	obsessive.  Nothing's ever on the
	level anymore.

A perplexed beat.

		ANDY
	George, it never was.
		(pause)
	Didn't you know that?

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Arnold Schwarzenegger, in his glory days as a body-builder,
on the cover of a magazine.  Magazines are everywhere.  Body-
building.  Women's.  Wrestling.

ANDY is sifting through them.  Zmuda watches, worried.

		ANDY
	Look at this!  An evil Russian!
	Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes
	to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil
	Japanese guy!

		ZMUDA
	What is this, World War Two...?

		ANDY
	You know, I always wanted to be a
	bad-guy wrestler...

		ZMUDA
	No offense, pal, but I just don't
	think you're built for it.  These he-
	men'll kick your ass!!  They're
	huge!

Andy's face drops.  He realizes Zmuda's right.

Beat -- then Andy notices an issue of Sumo Magazine, with a
picture of a wrestler and his cute little fiancйe on the
cover.  He slowly lifts it up, intrigued.

		ANDY
	Maybe I'll pick on someone smaller
	than me...!

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - DAY

CLOSE UP on Andy and Merv Griffin.  Andy wears a goofy
wrestling outfit that resembles thermal underwear.  He is
shouting like a wrestler.

		ANDY
	... And I vow to continue wrestling
	until I am BEA TEN, in a three-
	minute match, with my shoulders
	pinned to the mat!!

		MERV
		(nonplussed)
	By a woman.

		ANDY
	Yes!  BY A WOMAN!
		(emphatic)
	I'm doing this because I feel that a
	woman cannot beat a man in
	wrestling.  Even if they train with
	weights... it requires a certain
	mental ability --
		(a clumsy pause)
	And, uh -- I just don't feel they
	have that...

The audience MURMURS uncomfortably.  Andy laughs and
backpedals.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	No no!  Women are superior in many
	ways.  When it comes to cooking and
	cleaning, washing the potatoes,
	scrubbing the carrots, raising the
	babies, mopping the floors, they
	have it all over men.  I believe
	that!

An appalled silence.

Merv winces.  Some people start BOOING.  We can tell Andy is
pleased.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	But when it comes to wrestling,
	forget it!  If there's a woman that
	can prove me wrong, come up here.
	I'll shut my mouth and pay her 500
	dollars.

Merv baitingly turns to the crowd.

		MERV
	Any... volunteers...?

All the WOMEN'S hands angrily shoot up!

We move through the crowd, finally picking out... a feisty
woman, LYNNE.  She mutters, half hateful, half laughing --

		LYNNE
	I wanna kill that jerk.

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW - MINUTES LATER

Andy and Lynne stand in the ring.  She scornfully watches
him preen about.  Zmuda is in a referee's uniform.

		ZMUDA (AS REFEREE)
	Will you please shake hands, go to
	your corners, and come out
	wrestling.

Lynne extends her hand.  Andy fakes a shake -- then snidely
refuses and struts away.  The crowd HISSES.

DING!  It's the bell.  The match begins.  Lynne barrels at
him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this
experience.  Andy immediately grabs her by the legs and
flips her over.

WHUMP!  She's down.  Andy has trained for this.

Zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official.
Lynne struggles and slithers away.

She grabs Andy's arm and forces him down.  People CHEER.
His torso hits the mat.  LOUDER CHEERS.  But suddenly he
rolls over and pulls her hair!  Her head snaps back.  The
crowd is INCENSED.  Zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a
stern warning.

Andy nods, and they separate.  They do a little dance around
the ring, Lynne looking for a hole.  Suddenly, Andy spins
her into a Half-Nelson.  Her arms are pinned.  They
struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach.  One!
Two!  Three!

And DING!  It's OVER.  Andy jumps up and sneers at the
crowd.

		ANDY
	I'm the winner!  I've got the
	BRAINS!

	Now baby, don't fight nature!  Get

Lynne glares.

Out of the blue, and old RECORDING OF BOUNCY PIANO MUSIC
starts playing.  A chicken CLUCKS to the music, and Andy lip-
syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the
ring.

INT. MERV GRIFFIN SHOW, BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY

Lynne is escorted by a GUEST COORDINATOR.  Lynne is dazed.
The Coordinator hands her a bunch of crap.

		GUEST COORDINATOR
	Here's your complimentary photo with
	Merv.  Here's your Turtle Wax --

		LYNNE
	I don't need Turtle Wax.

		GUEST COORDINATOR
	Every guest of Merv gets it.  And
	here's your dinner-for-two voucher
	at Red Lobster.

Lynne takes her junk and hobbles off.  She passes Andy, who
sees her and grins.

		ANDY
	Gosh, you scored!  Look at all those
	goodies!

		LYNNE
	Buzz off.  Go patronize somebody
	else.

Lynne coldly hurries away.  Andy chases after her.

		ANDY
	Hey, I hope you didn't take that
	stuff I said seriously.  It was just
	part of the show!
		(eager to impress)
	It's like the old days, when a
	carnival barker would try to rile up
	the crowd.

		LYNNE
	Oh.  So you were just pretending to
	be an asshole.

Andy nods, pleased.

		ANDY
	It's what I'm good at!

Lynne stares -- then begrudgingly cracks a smile.

INT. GOLD'S GYM - DAY

Jumbo-sized BEEFY MEN work out, sweating and groaning.  In a
corner, Andy lifts huge barbells.  George stares, pained.

		GEORGE
	Merv Griffin has received 2000
	pieces of hate mail.  Andy, Merv
	Griffin doesn't GET hate mail.


		ANDY
	That means it was a success.  I woke
	up the audience -- like punk rock!
		(he hands him a
		BARBELL)
	Here, take this.

		GEORGE
	No, I'm not gonna take it.  If I
	take it I'll break my back.

He crosses his arms.  Andy frowns and lowers the weight.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Buddyboy, they detest you!  Next
	time you make an appearance, women
	are gonna picket.

		ANDY
	They're having a laugh...

		GEORGE
	WRONG!  You haven't given them any
	clues that it's a parody!

		ANDY
	That's because they've only seen it
	once.  But I'll do it again, and
	again, and AGAIN...
		(a maniacal grin)
	They'll catch on!

MONTAGE OF WRESTLING MATCHES:

MATCH 1 - Andy throws a FAT WOMAN to the ground.

MATCH 2 - Andy squeezes a SMALL WOMAN in a headlock.

MATCH 3 to MATCH 20 - Andy throws an ITALIAN LADY from the
ring.  He then proudly waves a phony plastic belt over his
head.

The crowd BOOS in disgust.

Two tickets jump out of the machine.

ANDY is standing in front, waiting.  A CAB stops and out
steps -- Lynne.

		ANDY
	Hi...

		LYNNE
	Hi... am I late?

		ANDY
	No, I'm sure we'll be fine.

Andy gives Lynne her ticket.  They enter the theater.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Andy hurries up to the candy counter.

		ANDY
	Popcorn?

		LYNNE
	No thanks.

		ANDY
	I really want one.
		(at the counter)
	One large tub of popcorn, please,
	extra butter.

The CANDY GIRL makes Andy his popcorn.  He pays... then
heads to the exit.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Okay.  Let's go.

Lynne is baffled.

		LYNNE
	Andy, the theater's that way!

		ANDY
	Hey, I love movie theater popcorn...
	but that doesn't mean I have to sit
	through "On Golden Pond."

Lynne stands in place.  Andy smiles.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	C'mon.  We'll go for a walk.

		LYNNE
		(beat; then she

	Fine.

She throws down her ticket and runs after him.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER, STREET - DAY

They leave the theater and walk down the sidewalk.

	You were impressed with something.
	It's pretty odd when a man sports a

	television.

Andy is shocked.

		ANDY
	Oh!  Uh, I hope I didn't offend you.

		LYNNE
	I'm here, ain't I?

A charged moment.  Andy's eyes widen.  His speech gets
faster.

		ANDY
	Do you wanna to go to Memphis and
	get married?

		LYNNE
		(incredulous)
	Do I wanna go to Memphis and get
	married?

		ANDY
	Yes.

Beat.

		LYNNE
	Why Memphis?

		ANDY
		(he SPEAKS VERY
		FAST)
	Because Memphis is the wrestling
	capital of the world!  I'll go in
	the ring, and I'll announce that I
	will shave my head and marry any
	woman who beats me!  Then you'll
	come up, we'll wrestle and I'll let
	you win!  Then you'll scalp me, and
	we'll get married on Letterman, like
	Tiny Tim did on Carson... right
	there on the show!  What do you
	say???

Whoa.  Lynne stares into his eyes.

	And all this will be for real?

	If you want...

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, MEMPHIS - NIGHT

The arena is filled with furious BOOING SOUTHERN WRESTLING
FANS.  Ladies in hair nets.  Men clutching beer cans.  This
is a rougher crowd than we've seen before.

Andy stands in the ring, unshaven in a torn green robe.
He's screaming at them.

		ANDY
		(screaming)
	SHUT UP!
		(more BOOS)
	SHUT UP!  Show some respect!  I want
	SILENCE when I speak!

People BOOO louder and throw debris.  Andy is pleased.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	If any woman can defeat me, I will
	pay her 1000 dollars!  Then I'll
	shave my head bald!  And then as a
	bonus -- that lucky lady will get to
	marry me!!

Screeching JEERS and CATCALLS.  Down front... Lynne jumps
up.

		LYNNE
	Look here, Andy Kaufman!  I'll take
	you on -- SISSY!

The mob LAUGHS harshly.

		ANDY
	Ooo, the little lady's upset.  Well
	I say -- get back in the kitchen!

		LYNNE
		("outraged")
	No!  YOU get in the kitchen.  I'm
	gonna make you dry my dishes!

The crowd APPLAUDS.  Lynne grins and starts to climb in the
ring.  Andy's eyes are ablaze.  But suddenly -- an oversized
Southern MAN jumps in and snatches the mike away.

		MAN
	STOP IT!  This woman's a FAKE!
	She's nothing but Kaufman's
	girlfriend!

Andy and Lynne are startled.

		ANDY
	T-that's not true --

		MAN
	It's a set-up!  And I won't allow
	our great sport to be degraded by a
	fix!!

The crowd angrily starts to HISS.  Lynne whispers to Andy.

		LYNNE
	Andy... who is that...?

		LAWLER
	I'm Jerry Lawler, the KING of
	Memphis wrestling!!
		(this gets HUGE
		CHEERS)
	So if Kaufman wants to tangle, I've
	brought a real wrestler!  She's
	trained and she's READY!!  Kaufman,
	do you think you can handle... FOXY
	JACKSON???!!!

At that, a striking, muscular black woman stands -- FOXY.

The coliseum SCREAMS with excitement.  People POUND their
seats.  The roar is deafening.  Lawler gleams cockily.
Lynne looks worriedly at Andy -- he's concerned.

					  CUT TO:

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - LATER THAT NIGHT

DING!  The bell rings.  Foxy comes out, ready to brawl.  But
Andy remains in his corner, running down the clock.  He
nonchalantly peels off his robe.  Foxy dances around
impatiently.  Andy casually removes a towel from his neck.
People BOO.  Still stalling, Andy then takes off his watch.

People SCREAM so furiously they're red-faced.  Andy is
tormenting them.  A TATTOOED GUY jumps up.

		TATTOOED GUY
	Are you scared???

Andy sneers.  He cracks his knuckles, finally walks over...
and commences a WINDMILL.  Absurdly, he spins his arms
around and around, daring Foxy to get near him.

She rolls her eyes and waits.  The REF jumps out of the way.
A minute has counted down.  Finally, Andy stops -- and the
real wrestling begins.  Foxy lunges at him and immediately
goes for a choke-hold.  The crowd CHEERS, relieved.  Lawler
motions signals.  Foxy yanks -- but Andy jerks away.

Andy is intrigued.  She's coming to play!  Andy gestures to
the Ref and points UP.  The Ref looks away -- and Andy SLAPS
Foxy.

The crowd furiously JEERS.  The Ref spins around, and Andy
shrugs innocence.  He then runs at Foxy and theatrically
pushes her into the ropes.  She bounces off, stumbles back -
- and Andy drops to his knees.  She trips over him and hits
the mat.

Andy aggressively jumps onto Foxy's shoulders and pins her.
The Ref counts:  One!  Two!  Three!  DING!!

It's over.  But Andy stays on her, shaking his ass, leering
rudely.  Jerry Lawler yells from the corner.

		LAWLER
	Alright, you won.  GET OFF HER!

Andy remains, flapping his arms like a chicken.

THE BOOING grows.  Louder.  More emotional.

		ANGRY VOICES
	Jerry, help her!  Get in there!  Do
	something!

Lawler hesitates -- then suddenly climbs in the ring and
lifts Andy off!  Lawler angrily PUSHES Andy down.

Andy is flabbergasted.

		ANDY
	W-what are you DOING?  I don't fight
	men!

Lawler snickers and walks away.  Completely overreacting,
Andy grabs the mike.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'm gonna SUE YOU!
		(he starts RANTING
		berserkly)
	Let me tell you something, Lawler!
	I am not a hick -- I'm a national TV
	star!  And I DON'T like a dumb
	cracker pushing me around in the
	ring!  I never agreed to wrestle
	you!  So you know what I'm gonna
	do???
		(seething)
	I'm gonna hire a lawyer to sue you
	for every cent you've got!  This was
	assault and battery!  In a court of
	law, I'm gonna kick your Southern-
	fried rump!!!

Lawler snatches the mike and bellows.

		LAWLER
	YEAH?!  Well I got news for you,
	Andy Kaufman!  Wrestling is a
	serious sport to me!  I don't like
	anyone makin' fun of it, and I hate
	anyone insultin' the South!  So we
	can settle this two ways: We can go
	to court... or you can get in the
	ring with a man, and wrestle for
	REAL!

Andy watches, fuming.  He is INFURIATED.

		ANDY
	He -- can't get away with this.
		(to Lawler)
	YOU!  You think I'm CHICKEN?!

Andy grabs back the mike.  He sticks his face in shocked
Lawler's.

		ANDY (cont'd)
		(sarcastic SOUTHERN
		ACCENT)
	You wanna "wraaastle" me?!  You
	wanna "WRAAASTLE" me???  Okay,
	Lawler -- let's rumble!  Yeah, I've
	only wrestled women, but they were
	bigger than you!  In fact, they're
	probably smarter than you, 'cause
	you're from "Maaamphis, Taaanassee!"
		(back to his regular
		voice, he points at
		his head)
	I'm from Hollywood.  I have the
	brains.  That's how I win.  And Mr.
	Lawler, I'm gonna make you cry
	"Mama!"

Andy bears his teeth.  Enraged, Lawler tries to take a swing
at him.  HANDLERS run in and separate the angry men.

EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, TUNNEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

We hear NOISE from the main event above.  Andy and Lynne
hurry along.  She is disgruntled.  He swaggers arrogantly,
still in his fighting outfit.

		LYNNE
	Is this an act -- or are you
	addicted to causing trouble??

		ANDY
		(he jokingly
		impersonates a
		drunk)
	I can shtop whenever I want...

She's unamused.

		LYNNE
	Then stop treating me like a fucking
	prop.

		ANDY
		(he drops the act)
	I-I'm sorry.  I got caught up in the
	action...!

She shoots him a stern look.

		LYNNE
	I'm warning you, Kaufman:  One
	morning you're gonna wake up... and
	your head's gonna be shaved.

Andy laughs.

eating a big piece of chocolate cake.

	Andy, do you realize you don't do

	guy who used to do
		(he SINGS Mighty
		Mouse)
	"Here I come to save the day!"?
		(long beat)
	Please, enough with the wrestling!
	You've lost touch with reality!

		ANDY
		(ingenuous)
	What, you don't think I can beat
	him?

		GEORGE
	He is the Southern Heavyweight
	Champion.  He'll kill you.
		(very disapproving)
	First, you piss-off women.  Then you
	piss-off the South.  Then you get
	killed!
		(dry)
	And I did the bookings.

Andy shrugs, lacking a response.  He eats more cake.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	Andy, look... there's a job I want
	you to take -- guest-hosting the TV
	show "Fridays."  It's not so hot...
	but this is a great opportunity for
	you.  The show's live, they'll give
	you carte blanche, and you can get
	back to the business of making
	people laugh.

Andy gets a strange gleam.  He only heard one thing.

		ANDY
	You said -- live?

INT. FRIDAYS SET, BACKSTAGE - DAY

The FRIDAYS CAST prepares.  In a corner, ANDY is arguing
with director JACK BURNS.

	Andy, it'll be fine!  It's what

The girl smiles excitedly.

The SKETCH is on a French restaurant set.  ANDY sits at a
table with actor RICHARDS and actress MELANIE.  Another
actress, MARY, tiptoes back over, GIGGLING stupidly, playing
stoned.

		MARY
	"Gee, restaurants are amazing,
	aren't they?  All these strangers
	sitting around... stuffing dead
	animals in their faces!  It's just
	incredible!"

She GIGGLES more.  The other three play baffled.

Andy awkwardly sits.  He has a strange hesitancy.

		ANDY
	"Gee, that bathroom is so colorf--"

Suddenly he STOPS.  The actors glance up.

Andy purses his lips, fretting.  An endless pause.

Uh-oh.  Andy won't finish the line.  The cast looks around
worriedly.  Live TV is beaming out... Finally, Melanie
covers.

		MELANIE
	You okay, honey?  Something wrong,

	I can't play stoned.  I feel really
	stupid.

More silence.  The actors are trapped and upset.

		MELANIE
	You feel stupid?  What about us?!

The tension is awful.

Unsure beat -- then fed-up Richards jumps up and storms off
the set.  A CAMERAMAN hesitantly pans, confused what to do.

Mary is lost.  She continues giggling, "stoned."

Richards returns... with the CUE CARDS.  Irked, he dumps
them over Andy's head.

The crowd CHEERS stupidly.

		ANDY
	You didn't have to do that!

Andy gets enraged, grabs his prop water glass and THROWS it
in Richard's face.

Melanie slaps her prop butter in Andy's hair.

BURLY CREWMEN run in.  The crowd WHOOOOOS.

Andy and Jack are socking each other.  A FLOOR DIRECTOR

	WE'VE GONE TO COMMERCIAL!!

Andy turns.  He notices the red lights are off -- and...
instantly stops fighting.  Just like that.  Jack instantly
stops too.  They glance at each other -- hold a beat -- then
break into GUFFAWS.  They laugh and joyously kid each other.

In the audience, Michael is STUNNED.

		MELANIE
	Oh my God --!

All the commotion stops.  The audience doesn't know whether
to laugh or boo.  The actors are flabbergasted -- then
furious.

Suddenly Maynard runs out of the booth, beaming.  People
watch curiously.

Andy seems discombobulated.  Maynard shouts out to EVERYBODY
assembled.

	to make!  You've all just
	participated in a "happening."  To

in disbelief.  One laughs hysterically.  Most are pissed.

	But we don't want to upset the folks

	to apologize and explain that it was
	all a prank.  Right, Andy?

	Right...

serious.

	It's a lie!  A cover-up!

Maynard is suddenly very confused.  The crowd laughs
nervously.

	Now for sure they're gonna fire me,

The THEME FROM "MIGHTY MOUSE" begins playing.  Then, ANDY
strides in, a sneer on his grungy face.  The crowd SCREAMS
and BOOS pure pile.  Andy is euphoric, loving the hatred.

Down in the front row sit Stanley, Janice, Zmuda, and Lynne.
Several PHOTOGRAPHERS take pictures of the parents.  They
squint, unused to all this.

Andy prances into the ring.  He takes the mike.

		ANDY
	Before we begin this event, I just
	wanna say a few things to you foul
	people.
		(beat)
	This city is filthy!  You
	Southerners live like pigs!  So I'm
	going to teach you some lessons in
	hygiene... bring you out of your
	squalor.

Holy cow.  The crowd is flabbergasted.  Women in K-mart
dresses gape.  Ruddy men in trucker caps glare.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Are you listening?
		(audience BOOS)
	OKAY!!!

Lynne snickers.  But Stanley and Janice are ashen-faced.

		JANICE
	Why is he saying these things?!

		STANLEY
	They're gonna lynch him!

		ZMUDA
		(he shakes his head)
	Nah.  He's just engaging a passive
	audience.

Andy reaches in his pocket and removes... a bar of SOAP.

		ANDY
	People, this is a bar of soap.  Does
	it look familiar to you?  If you wet
	it, it'll clean your hands.

Stanley's eyes bulge.

The crowd is enraged -- rumblings of imminent violence.

Andy smiles helpfully.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	And now, for your next lesson: This
	-- is toilet paper.

Andy holds up a ROLL OF TISSUE.

That's it.  The crowd goes NUTS.  Jerry Lawler races over
and snatches the mike, trying to maintain his dignity.

		LAWLER
	Kaufman, we've had enough!!  Let's
	you and me do what we came here for
	-- WRESTLING!

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - SECONDS LATER

And DING!  That's the bell!  Andy strikes a threatening
pose.  Lawler takes a step forward -- and Andy instantly,
cowardly, runs for the ropes and jumps out of the ring.

BOOOOO!!!  Andy grins at the crowd and points at his brain:
I'm smarter.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And Kaufman's left the ring!
	Lawler's waiting for him to return.

		LYNNE
		(to Zmuda)
	Is this a strategy?

Lawler disparagingly frowns.  The REF checks his watch.
Andy crosses to the opposite end of the ring, gauging his
rival... then slowly climbs in --

Until the second Lawler moves.  Then Andy leaps back out!

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	And Kaufman's left the ring again!
	He doesn't seem interested in
	actually making contact with his
	opponent.

Andy struts around the floor, pointing to his brain.  He
smirks at various spectators... until he finds himself face-
to-face with -- his parents.

An unexpected moment.  Andy's finger frozen on his brain.
Janice shakes her head despairingly.

		JANICE
	Andy, please.  Let's go home!

Cameras FLASH.  The paparazzi love these moments.

		ANDY
	Don't worry, Mom.  I'll make you
	proud...!

Beat -- then Andy gets HIT in the head with a cup.

People HOOT.  Disoriented, Andy returns to the ringside.
Lawler is losing his patience.

		LAWLER
	Hey!  Did you come down here to
	wrestle, or to act like an ass?

Andy paces around, unsure of his next move.

		LAWLER (cont'd)
	Look... if you get in here, I'll
	give you a free headlock.

Lawler leans down and offers his neck.

Andy peers skeptically.  People JEER.  Andy looks at waiting
Lawler... then tentatively climbs in.

As promised, Lawler doesn't move.  So Andy crosses over and
grabs Lawler's head!  Andy grins triumphantly.  He squeezes
his arms tight, muscles flexing, riding high on this moment.

Until -- Lawler stands and flips him over.  Andy SLAMS DOWN
on his back.  CRUNCH!

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	It's a side suplex!!

Andy lies on the mat, unmoving.  Lawler doesn't care.  He
picks up Andy's prone body and grips it upside-down.  Janice
covers her eyes.  Stanley is worried.

		REFEREE
		(frantically
		gesturing)
	NO!  NO!

Lawler disregards the Ref and slams Andy's head in a pile-
driver!!

A horrible THUD.

DING!  The BELL immediately RINGS.

JANICE opens her eyes and SCREAMS.

		JANICE
	JESUS CHRIST!!!!!

		STANLEY
	Why isn't he MOVING??

Andy's parents' reaction is a fiesta for photographers.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Lawler has committed a PILEDRIVER,
	which is an AUTOMATIC
	DISQUALIFICATION!  Match goes to
	Kaufman by disqualification, after
	two minutes, twelve seconds!
Andy is splayed unconscious.

Raging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his
head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on.

Lynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help.

		LYNNE
	ANDY!!!
		(frantic)
	Somebody get a DOCTOR!

		ZMUDA
		(yelling)
	WE NEED A STRETCHER!!

Stanley, totally numbed, holds Janice.  They're on the verge
of collapsing.  Tons of commotion.  Cameras FLASH
BLINDINGLY.  A stretcher is lifted into the ring.  Andy is
loaded on.  MUSIC fights the deafening NOISE.

BEDLAM.  Andy is carried through the crowd, followed by his
entourage.  A soft object HITS Stanley on the head.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Andy is being carried by the Coliseum EMPLOYEES into the
dressing room.  The entourage follows.  Zmuda pushes out the
crowd of REPORTERS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, and ONLOOKERS.  He slams
the door and locks it.

INT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM, DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Janice runs to Andy's side.  She's crying.

		JANICE
	Andy!!  Are you okay?!?

Andy opens his eyes.

		ANDY
	I'm fine, Mom, you can calm down.

A confused beat.

		STANLEY
	B-but... we saw... your neck...

		ANDY
	Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked
	the whole thing.
		(beat)
	It didn't hurt at all.  It was just
	a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.

Deadpan, Andy sits up.

Total silence.  Stanley stares... then a FURY comes over
him.

		STANLEY
	Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we
	knew, you were DYING!  Look at your
	mother -- she's still shaking!

Andy is splayed unconscious.

Raging Lawler promenades around the ring, arms over his
head.  The crowd SHOUTS CRAZILY, rooting him on.

Lynne runs to the ropes, SCREAMING for help.

		LYNNE
	ANDY!!!

	Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we

	mother -- she's still shaking!

		ANDY
	But that's it.  I needed you to
	believe!  Our family will be in the
	newspapers.  People will look, and
	they'll be touched.  Because your
	emotions were honest!

Stanley has a blank expression.  But Janice starts to cry.

		JANICE
	Andy, I love you!  I love you,
	whatever you do...!

She hugs Andy tightly.

Andy is genuinely shocked.  He looks at his quivering
mother... and then his voice softens, truly remorseful.

		ANDY
	Geez, I'm sorry.  Maybe I shouldn't
	have put you through all that...
		(quiet)
	Well, from now on, you'll always
	know the rule of thumb: Anything
	that happens to me... IS NOT REAL.

EXT. MID-SOUTH COLISEUM - NIGHT

A crowd of reporters parts.  They make way for Andy, who is
carried out on the stretcher and loaded into a waiting
AMBULANCE.  He is "unconscious."

Cameras CLICK and FLASH.  The ambulance speeds away, siren
WAILING.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Andy sits watching an OLD DOCTOR examining a number of x-
rays clipped to light panels.

		OLD DOCTOR
	I don't see any injury to your neck,
	Mr. Kaufman.

		ANDY
	Are you sure?

		OLD DOCTOR
	Positive.

		ANDY
	But my neck hurts... and I have a
	slight cough...

		OLD DOCTOR
	It's probably just a strained
	muscle.

		ANDY
		(intent)
	Doctor, I think I need a neck brace.

The Doctor gives up.

		OLD DOCTOR
	If it makes you happy...

MONTAGE OF NEWSPAPER PHOTOS:

Andy in the ring, Andy outside the ring, on the floor, with
his frightened parents, in a neck brace, on the stretcher,

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

George, Zmuda and Andy are looking through hundreds of
clippings from the newspapers.

		ZMUDA
		(reading aloud)
	"... has been rushed to a nearby
	hospital, where doctors are checking
	him for possible paralysis.  His
	parents are at his bedside.  Fans
	will best remember Kaufman as
	lovable Latka on television's
	Taxi"...

		ANDY
	It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my
	death, they'll really miss me.

		ZMUDA
	It's working for Elvis.

		GEORGE
		(sarcastic)
	Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin'
	for his comeback.
		(he sees an article
		and winces)
	God, listen to this!  "It was
	morally wrong to take advantage of
	such an unstable individual..."

		ZMUDA
	Wow, you can't BUY this kind of
	publicity!

George rolls his eyes.

		ANDY
	George, let's not drop the ball on
	this.  I've made some kind of cosmic
	career move.

Somebody KNOCKS outside.  Andy jumps up, puts on his neck
brace, and transforms himself into a shuffling invalid.  A
DELIVERY BOY drags in an enormous basket of flowers and
goodies.  Andy takes the card.  It reads "Andy, we're all
praying for you.  Your friends at Taxi."

Andy chuckles.

EXT. ROCKEFELLER CENTER - DAY

George is eating with the Saturday Night Live Producer,
Lorne Michaels.  They're eating lunch in an outdoor cafe.

		GEORGE
	Thanks for seeing me on such short
	notice.
		(he takes a careful
		beat)
	I... I wanted to talk to you about
	booking Andy on "Saturday Night
	Live."

Lorne Michaels squirms uncomfortably.  He chooses his words.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	George -- I don't know if Andy works
	for our show anymore.  That
	wrestling stuff... is such a
	turnoff.

		GEORGE
	We agree completely.
		(tactfully begging)
	Andy has to reconnect with his core
	audience.  So I got him on Letterman
	tonight.  He's gonna apologize to
	Jerry Lawler, then repent for all
	his bad guy shenanigans.

Lorne Michaels mulls this over.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	That's smart.

		GEORGE
	He's very sincere.
		(quietly emphatic)
	And he needs your show...

Beat.  Lorne Michaels nods.

		LORNE MICHAELS
	Okay.  It'd be good to have the old
	Andy back.

					  CUT TO:

INT. DAVID LETTERMAN SHOW - NIGHT

Andy and Jerry Lawler are on DAVID LETTERMAN'S show.  Andy
is pallid, hair shaggy, in a neckbrace and tweed jacket.
Husky Lawler wears loud red pants and gold chains.

Andy speaks timidly, seeming a bit dazed and regretful.

		ANDY
	I apologize for all the wrestling
	I've ever done.  I'm sorry for all
	the abuse I've ever given...
		(soft)
	I was just playing bad guy wrestler.
	That's not me... it's just a role.
	But Jerry took it personally.

Lawler and Letterman are unimpressed.

		LETTERMAN
	You said some pretty inflammatory
	things.

		LAWLER
	He thinks everything's a joke -- but
	it's not.
		(to Andy)
	Did you laugh when you were layin'
	in the hospital??

The crowd WHOOOOS.

Angst flickers on Andy's sweaty face.  He stammers.

		ANDY
	T-there wasn't a reason to purposely
	hurt me --

		LAWLER
	You're a wimp.

		ANDY
		(upset)
	My father said I should've gotten a
	lawyer --!

		LAWLER
	Then your father's a wimp.

		ANDY
		(losing it)
	And you're just poor white trash!

Lawler's had enough.  Enraged, he wildly stands and SLAPS
Andy.

BAM!

Andy crashes over and falls from his chair.

THUD.  He's on the floor.

Dead silence.  Everyone is astonished.

They're all slack-jawed.  Even PAUL SHAFFER.  Trying to
cover, Paul hurriedly kicks in with a ROCKABILLY TUNE.

Andy jumps up, crazed.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THIS SHIT!

Lawler freezes in his seat.  Letterman hides behind his
desk.

Andy storms over, out-of-control.  From a safe distance, he
starts SCREAMING at Lawler.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	YOU ARE FULL OF SHIT, Lawler!  I
	WILL SUE YOUR ASS!  YOU'RE A FUCKING
	ASSHOLE!
		(he POUNDS the desk)
	FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU
	FOR THIS!!!

Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out.

		LETTERMAN
	You said some pretty inflammatory
	things.

		LAWLER
	He thinks everything's a joke -- but
	it's not.
		(to Andy)
	Did you laugh when you were layin'

	FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU!  I WILL GET YOU

Freaked, Andy leaps up and storms out.

The crowd CHEERS rowdily.

An unsure moment.  Dave glances at Lawler.

Until, Andy stumbles back in.  He tries to calm himself.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I am sorry.  I am sorry to use those
	words on television.  I apologize!
	I'm sorry!
		(demented)
	But YOU -- you're a MOTHERFUCKING
	ASSHOLE!!!!

Andy slams Dave's desk.  Dave jerks nervously.

Crazed, Andy looks down at Dave's coffee cup.  Uh-oh.
Suddenly, Andy grabs the coffee and DUMPS it on Lawler!

Lawler jumps, burned.  A SECURITY GUARD runs in.

Andy screams and hurtles away.  He slams open the stage door
and barrels out of sight.

INT. SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE - ONE WEEK LATER

A SMUG COMIC stands on stage, speaking into camera.  The
show's going out live.

		SMUG COMIC
	Hi.  Um, we were supposed to have
	Andy Kaufman on our show this week -
	- but now our producers aren't sure
	if it's such a good idea.
		(beat)
	Some of us at Saturday Night Live
	think Kaufman's a comic genius.  But
	others disagree... they say he's
	just not funny anymore.
		(beat)
	So we're putting the decision up to
	you.  Please call up and vote.  To
	keep Andy, call 1-900-244-7618.  To
	DUMP him, call...

INT. SHAPIRO/WEST - DAY

Tight on Andy, staring at the LA Times.  A small headline
says "JOKESTER ANDY KAUFMAN VOTED OFF 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE'"

He is bothered.

		ANDY
	This is bad... I only got 28
	percent!  I'm like McGovern in
	'72...

George sighs.

		GEORGE
	And this wasn't "Merv."  This was
	the hippest audience on television.
		(grim)
	They've turned on you.

At that... we reveal that SOMEONE ELSE is sitting next to
Andy.  But only the back of his head is visible.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	It's like you two guys wanted to
	destroy Andy's career!  Upsetting
	all those people... putting out that
	toxic venom...
		(helpless)
	What did you THINK would happen?!

		ANDY
		(guilty)
	We were just trying to push the
	envelope --

		GEORGE
	You're BLIND!  There is no envelope
	anymore!!
		(beat)
	It hurts me to say this... but
	there's only one solution --
		(pained)
	I don't want you two to ever work
	together again.

We WIDEN...

And the other person is JERRY LAWLER.  He feels bad.

		JERRY LAWLER
	I'm sorry.  We thought it was
	funny...

		ANDY
	Jer', it's not your fault.  You were
	terrific.
		(sad)
	But maybe George is right...

		JERRY LAWLER
	That's fine.  But I wouldn't have
	traded it for anything...
		(poignant)
	Because for one brief, shining
	moment... the world thought that
	wrestling was real.
Andy gulps emotionally.

		ANDY
	We'll stay in touch.  Next time I'm
	in Memphis, I'll stop by the house,
	and Noreen can make me her double
	chocolate cake.

		JERRY LAWLER
	Alright, buddy...
		(choked up)
	Stay good.

Andy and Jerry hug.

A touching beat... until Andy gets a Quixotic gleam.

		ANDY
	Maybe I can turn it into a bit.  I
	can go back on the show, and say it
	was rigged.  Demand a recount...

		GEORGE
	Andy!  You don't get it!
		(somber)
	They don't want you back.

Andy's face drops.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

The Yogi slowly walks down the corridor, deep in thought.  A
few DISCIPLES IN TURBANS mill around.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CLASSROOM - DAY

NINE STUDENTS, sitting in the Lotus position, are listening
to a teacher.  The teacher is Andy.

		ANDY
	Open your eyes... close your eyes...
	open your eyes... close your eyes...
	open your eyes... close your eyes...

Andy is repeating this faster and faster; the students are
blinking their eyes faster and faster.

The door opens.  The Yogi sticks his head in.

		YOGI
	Excuse me, Andy...

		ANDY
	Yes, your Holiness?

The Yogi signals Andy to step out of the room.

INT. MEDITATION INSTITUTE UNIVERSITY, CORRIDOR - DAY

Andy steps out.

		YOGI
	This is very difficult for me to
	say... but -- perhaps it would be
	best if you didn't attend the
	retreat.

		ANDY
		(surprised)
	Why??  I... I attend every year.

		YOGI
	Yes -- we do not doubt your devotion
	to TM.  But we feel that perhaps...
	you and the program have grown apart
	philosophically.

Andy is stunned.

		ANDY
	"Philosophically"?

		YOGI
		(he sighs)
	The wrestling... the sexist
	remarks... the foul language...
	these things are not becoming of an
	enlightened individual.
		(beat)
	It seems you have no respect for
	anything.

Andy is stupefied.  He doesn't know how to respond.

		ANDY
	Of course I do...

The Yogi shakes his head.  Andy can't believe it.  He looks
around -- men in turbans staring at him.

Andy cracks.

		ANDY
	Please!  You've GOT to let me take
	the classes!  It's how I keep myself
	BALANCED!!

		YOGI
	It is apparently not working.

		ANDY
	So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is
	MEDITATE!!

		YOGI
		(pained)
	Andy, don't raise your voice.  We
	don't wish your presence here.

Andy is broken.

He fights to bottle his rage -- then notices Little Wendy
down the corridor, peering helplessly.  Beaten, Andy waves
goodbye to her.

Little Wendy gulps, then waves goodbye too.

INT. ANDY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Middle of the afternoon, Andy lies in bed.  Covers pulled up
to his face, expression glum, he's like a tragic still-life.

Suddenly DING-DONG!  It's the doorbell.

Andy ignores this.  Beat.  Another DING-DONG!  Then
KNOCKING.

		ANDY
	Go away.

		LYNNE (O.S.)
	It's me.

		ANDY
	Oh, it's open.

The door opens.  Lynne enters, holding a carton of ice
cream.

		LYNNE
	I brought you Haagen Dazs.
	Chocolate.

		ANDY
		(mournful)
	I don't deserve Haagen Daz.  I'm a
	horrible person.

		LYNNE
	Andy, you're not horrible.  You're
	just... complicated.

		ANDY
	You don't know the real me.

		LYNNE
	Andy... there is no real you.

TIGHT - ANDY

An astonished silence.

And then... he slowly smiles.

		ANDY
	You're probably right.

They both giggle.

Andy studies her... looking at Lynne's face, body, eyes.
Pause.

		ANDY
	Do you wanna move in together?

Lynne smiles slyly.  She leans down and kisses him.

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

A moving van outside a funky 60's house.  MOVERS carry boxes
in.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Andy sits disoriented in the living room.  Movers bustle
around him.  Mirrors get leaned against opposing walls --
and he finds himself looking into multiple reflections of
himself.

In the b.g., Lynne arranges some vases, then hurries out.
Andy opens a box and pulls out his old Howdy Doody doll.  He
smiles, then places Howdy on the shelf next to the vases.

Suddenly a phone on the floor RINGS.  He grins.

		ANDY
	Hey!  Our first phone call!
		(he scrambles for
		the phone)
	Hello?

		GEORGE (V.O.)
	Andy... it's me.  I've got some
	crummy news.
		(long beat)
	Taxi's been canceled.

Silence.

Andy has no response.

		GEORGE (V.O.) (cont'd)
	Do you want me to come over?  Talk
	about it?

		ANDY
	Um... no.  Uh, I'm sorta busy right
	now.  Thanks.  We'll get together
	next week.

Andy hangs up.  He just sits there... confused... unsure how
to react.

Andy scratches his head -- then feels something odd.  He
goes over to the mirror.  On the back of his neck... is an
inflamed red pimple.  Andy grimaces.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Yuck!

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATE NIGHT

Very late -- a clock says 1:15.  A YOUNG COMIC is onstage,
performing to the DOZEN audience members left.

In back walks... Andy.  Unshaven, morose, he quietly
approaches paternal owner BUDD FRIEDMAN.  Budd sees him,
grins, and gives him a hearty hug.  Andy points at the stage
and asks for something -- Budd eagerly nods.

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Budd is onstage.

		BUDD
	And now we have a treat for you late-
	night diehards.  The star of Taxi --
	here in person, Andy Kaufman!

The sparse crowd APPLAUDS.  Budd leaves, and Andy shuffles
up.

		ANDY
	Actually, Budd, you're wrong.  I
	found out today that Taxi's been
	canceled.

The crowd AWWWWS sadly.  Andy blinks.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Yeah, that's how I felt too...
	though I don't know why.  'Cause for
	years, all I wanted to do was get
	off that show.
		(quiet, very
		confessional)
	But now that nobody will hire me,
	and nobody thinks I'm funny... I
	guess it was probably a pretty good
	job.

One guy LAUGHS sharply.

Andy gives him a look -- thinks -- then continues.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	Not to mention that my wife has left
	me.  And she took the kids.
		(he sighs)
	I don't know what I'm gonna do with
	myself.  My options are sorta
	limited...
		(beat)
	This morning, I noticed I've got a
	cyst, or some kind of boil, on the
	back of my neck.  It's really
	disgusting.  Look.

Andy turns.  The red lump is bigger, grosser.  The crowd
GROANS, revolted.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	So I was thinking, since I'm sort of
	a quasi-celebrity, that I could

		(candid)
	Does anybody want to pay a buck to
	touch my cyst?

A couple stoners GIGGLE and CLAP.  Andy COUGHS, then frowns.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	I'm serious.

A pause... then a few curious people walk up to the stage.
The first taker is a GOOFY BLONDE WOMAN.  She starts to
reach for the cyst -- when Andy stops her.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	No, no, you gotta pay first.

She nods, discomforted, and reaches for her purse...

INT. LA IMPROV, BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

A BUSBOY sweeps up.  Budd counts money in the cash register.
Andy shuffles out of the showroom.  He waves some bills.

		ANDY
	I made six bucks.  That's good
	money.

Budd stares sadly.

		BUDD
	This is a comedy club -- not a
	medical sideshow.
		(trying to be kind)
	If you wanna perform here, take a
	shower, get some sleep, and pull
	yourself together.  Come back and do
	the material that people love: Do
	the Mighty Mouse, the Foreign guy!
	Andy, you gotta snap out of this
	funk!  If you can -- I'll give you
	the headline spot tomorrow.

Andy thinks.  The wheels are spinning.

EXT. MELROSE - DAY

George is driving down Melrose, listening to the radio.  He
glances at the passing marquee -- then does a doubletake.

It says "ANDY KAUFMAN - 9 P.M."

INT. LA IMPROV, LOBBY - THAT NIGHT

Puzzled George hurries inside.  COMICS greet him: "Hey
George!"  "George, you got a second?!"  George distractedly
waves and moves through.  At the showroom door, he finds
Budd.

		GEORGE
	Hey, what's going on here?

		BUDD
	George, you won't believe it... I
	got Andy to do all the old material!
		(grinning)
	And he's killin' them!

Inside, there's HUGE LAUGHTER.  George's eyes widen.
Piqued, he goes in...

INT. LA IMPROV, SHOWROOM - NIGHT

And it's packed!  Andy is onstage, playing struggling,
lovable Foreign Man.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	... but one ting I do not like is
	too much traffic.  Tonight I had to
	come on de freeway, and it was so
	much traffic...
		(giggling)
	It took me an hour and a half to get
	here!

Foreign Man chuckles pathetically.

The crowd HOWLS.  Andy's rockin'.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	But talking about the terrible
	things: My wife.  Take my --

		INTERRUPTING JERK
	"Take my wife, please take her."

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	T-take my wife, please take her...

The rhythm is thrown.  A couple laughs.

A flustered pause.  Andy glances down, then continues.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	No really, I am only foolink.  I
	love my wife very much.  But she
	don't know how to cook --

		INTERRUPTING JERK
	"Her cooking is so bad, is
	terrible."

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)
	H-her cooking...
		(Andy stumbles
		uncomfortably)
	Uh, cooking is so bad, is terrible.

The laughs are weaker.  The act is getting wrecked.

IN BACK - George grimaces.  Who the hell's doing this??

Angry, George hurries down front, looking for the loud jerk.
He scans the tables... and it's Zmuda.

		ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN) (cont'd)
	But right now --

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	"But right now I would like to do
	for you some imitations.  First, the
	Archie Bunker."

Andy freezes up.

The audience is embarrassed.

A frazzled confusion, then Andy drops the accent.  He glares
at Zmuda.

		ANDY
	Sir, do you have a problem?

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	Yeah, my problem is you're tired.

Andy winces.

		ANDY
	I, I was asked to do this material -
	-

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	Sure, because your new stuff's a
	bunch of crap.  Kaufman, people are
	sick of you.  The wrestling... the
	hoaxes...

		ANDY
		(defensive)
	Hey -- that stuff gets written-up in
	the papers --

		ZMUDA (AS JERK)
	Who gives a shit?!  It's not funny!

GEORGE - is dumbfounded.

		GEORGE
		(to himself)
	Why...?  Andy, why...?

ON ANDY AND ZMUDA

		ZMUDA
	I used to think you were original.

		ANDY
	I was very original!

		ZMUDA
	Yeah, exactly -- "was"!  But now,
	you're creatively bankrupt.
		(he gleams cruelly)
	In fact, Ladies and Gentlemen,
	Kaufman's so desperate, he PAID me
	to do this tonight!!  I'm a plant.
	It's just a fresh coat of paint on
	an old broken-down routine.
		(back to Andy)
	Isn't that true???

Andy shudders.

The audience averts their eyes.

A painful silence.

"Andy Kaufman" has been destroyed.

EXT. LA IMPROV - LATER THAT NIGHT

Andy and George walk sadly down the street.  There is a
horrible gloom over them.

		ANDY
	The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks.
	So I was just giving 'em what they
	want...

		GEORGE
		(sadly)
	Andy, they don't think you suck.
	They've just... lost a reason to
	love you.

The guys stop walking.  George gently speaks.

		GEORGE (cont'd)
	You've gotta make the public embrace
	you again.  You have to win back
	their sympathy...

ON ANDY

He nods.

		ANDY
	I'll come up with something.

INT. LAUREL CANYON, BEDROOM - NIGHT

The telephone wakes up Lynne in the new bedroom.  She looks
over -- Andy's not there.  She looks at the clock and it's
4:30 am.  She picks up the phone.

		LYNNE
	Andy!!... Where are you?  I've been
	worried sick... NOW??... Where do
	you want to meet?... Okay, I'll call
	them...

Lynne's baffled.

INT. DENNY'S - DAWN

Late-night Hollywood weirdos mill about.  Andy sits with
bleary Lynne, Zmuda, and George.  Zmuda admires the menu.

		ZMUDA
	Look at that Grand Slam!  Two eggs,
	two bacon, two sausage, two pancakes
	-- $2.99!  How do they do it?

		LYNNE
	They get you on the coffee.

		GEORGE
		(irritable)
	Excuse me -- but could Andy tell us
	why we're here???

All heads turn.  A long pause.

Then -- Andy stiffly speaks.

		ANDY
	I have cancer.

Beat.  Zmuda nods.

		ZMUDA
	Hey, that's good!  We can make that
	play.
		(spitballing)
	And we'll really drag it out.  You
	get better, you get worse... you
	die...

		GEORGE
	FORGET IT.  It's in terrible taste!
	I want nothing to do with this.

Pause.  Lynne is puzzled.

		LYNNE
	Andy, are you serious?

		ZMUDA
		(grinning)
	Serious like a heart attack!  Hey,
	maybe I can push you around in some
	goofy wheelchair!

Andy softly shakes his head.

		ANDY
	No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.

		GEORGE
	That's ridiculous.  You don't even
	smoke.

		ANDY
		(emphatic)
	I -- I got some freaky rare kind.
	It's called large-celled carcinoma.

Lynne's eyes tear up.  She hugs onto Andy.

		LYNNE
	Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?

		ANDY
	They don't know... they've gotta run
	more tests.

		LYNNE
		(starting to cry)
	Have you told your family?

		ANDY
	No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad --
	I've jerked 'em around so many
	times.

George and Zmuda glance skeptically at each other.  Hmm...
Confused, George leans in to Andy.

		GEORGE
	Andy... you look me in the eye, and
	tell me this is true.

Andy gulps.

		ANDY
	George -- it's true.

INT. DENNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

George confronts Zmuda.

		GEORGE
	If I find out you're behind this,
	I'll kill you.

		ZMUDA
	What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was
	the one saying I didn't believe it!


		GEORGE
	Exactly.  That's the sort of thing
	you guys would work out to fuck me
	up.

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY

Andy is doing laundry.  He empties the clean clothes, puts
them in a basket, and carries them to the rug.  Then he sits
down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly
symmetrical patterns.  Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly
orders the socks like the world depended on it.

Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked.  She stares in
frustration at Andy's behavior.

		LYNNE
	How can you be so casual??!

		ANDY
		(he shrugs)
	Even if I'm dying -- I still need
	clean socks.

		LYNNE
	You're NOT DYING!

		ANDY
	Okay.  You're probably right.

He keeps working.  Lynne loses it.

		LYNNE
	God, you're so detached!!

Lynne storms out.

Andy finishes his socks.  Satisfied... he turns on the TV.

ON THE TV: It's "Lassie."  Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed,
with a broken leg.  Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book.
Lassie places the book on his lap.  The boy smiles
gratefully.

		TIMMY (ON TV)
	Thank you, girl.  You're my best
	friend.

Timmy warmly embraces the dog.

ANDY - is terribly touched.  Tears start rolling down his
face.

Genuine sobbing.  Terrible grief, until he wipes his cheeks.
Andy collects himself, then reaches for a phone.  He dials a
long number.

		ANDY

	Dad...?

INT. CEDARS SINAI, RADIATION ROOM - DAY
ANDY lies under the machine.  It bombards his body with
powerful radiation.

INT. CEDARS SINAI, DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The whole Kaufman family is gathered.  Stanley, Janice,
Michael and Carol listen to a BLAND DOCTOR in a white coat.

		DOCTOR
	The cancer started in Andy's left
	arm and spread to his lungs.  We've
	initiated an aggressive radiation
	program... see if we can eradicate
	the affected cells.
		(his BEEPER goes
		off)
	Excuse me.  I'll be right back.

The doctor leaves.  A somber silence -- and then Janice
bursts into tears.  Stanley hugs her tightly.

Carol watches the doctor with great hostility.  His old
tennis shoes are grabbing her attention.  He leaves, and she
frowns.

		CAROL
	What a crock.

		STANLEY
		(angered)
	How dare you make light of this!

		CAROL
	Dad, I cried when he broke his neck.
	He's not gettin' me again --

		STANLEY
		(impassioned)
	Jesus!  He's got lung cancer!

A standoff moment.  Carol loses it.

		CAROL
	See, that's exactly it!  He picked
	lung cancer, because he doesn't
	smoke.  That makes it weird!  If
	he'd picked leukemia, it'd be
	totally believable, and we'd all be
	going, "Poor Andy, he's really
	sick."  So he chose lung cancer,
	because he WANTS us to be scratching
	our heads, saying, "Is this real?"

		JANICE
		(trying to convince
		herself)
	Of course it's real.  We're in a
	hospital...

		MICHAEL
	Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a
	showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio
	friends probably run this place!

		CAROL
	He plans these things out.  He takes
	over, hires actors...
		(beat)
	Personally, I didn't think that
	"doctor" was very convincing.

		MICHAEL
	Did you notice his costume had the
	wrong shoes?

		CAROL
		(excited)
	Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes!

A moment of total silence.  All four of them look at each
other.  Is there... a glimmer of hope?

		MICHAEL
	We all know he's talked about faking
	his own death...

		STANLEY
	Sure -- but what if he isn't?

	My son could be dying... and we're

Shh!

INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

The house is dark.  Lynne leads George into the shrouded
living room... and Andy is sitting in a Lotus position,
concentrating.  In front is a WILD-HAIRED MAN in a purple
robe.

		WILD-HAIRED MAN
	I want you to visualize.  Visualize
	big, healthy white cells in your
	body.  Now visualize little cancer
	cells.  Now those big white cells

skepticism.

The drapes are open.  Sunlight streams in.  Andy hugs the
teacher goodbye, and the man leaves.

George has been waiting in back.

		GEORGE
	What was that all about?

		ANDY
	It's visualization therapy.  He's
	helping me turn inward and fight the
	disease.

Long beat.

		GEORGE
	He's an actor.  I remember him in
	"The In-Laws."

Ah.  Andy's eyes widen.  His wheels are spinning fast.

		ANDY
	Uh, yes... that's true.  But he's
	also ordained in holistic medicine.

ON GEORGE - He glares, stewing.  George is fed up.

ON ANDY - An unspoken tension.  Then suddenly, he breaks
down.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	George, what am I supposed to do?!
	I'm sick, and I'm tryin' to get
	better... but everyone's lookin' at
	me funny!  Even you come to my home
	and act like I'm puttin' on a skit!

		GEORGE
	You must take a little pleasure in
	it.

		ANDY
	Of course!
		(beat)
	But that doesn't mean I don't need
	everyone's support!  I can't be
	surrounded by negative energy.

George shakes his head.

		GEORGE
	Andy, you're surrounded by what you
	create.  You are the KING of
	negative energy.

		ANDY
		(thrown)
	Y-yeah?  Well, then it has to stop!
	Because if these bad vibes get
	out... then everyone will be talkin'
	about how sick I am, and it becomes
	a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then
	-- I'm dead.

Andy struggles to remain composed.  George sighs.

		GEORGE
	So how can I help you...?

		ANDY
	I wanna go back to work and put on a
	happy show.

	The best show anybody's ever seen!

	This is great.  The crowd's gonna
	love this!

	Hey... do you still think any of
	those cowgirls are still alive?

	Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get

	I want the evening to build and

	No!  NO NO NO!  None of that!  I

Andy smiles.

	I don't care about the money.  I

	So who's gonna pay for it?

	Tony Clifton.

	You know Tony doesn't have that kind

	Then he'll borrow it.  I know Tony

Eleanor starts to protest -- but Andy hands her the HOBBY

starts conducting.  They begin to PLAY "JINGLE JANGLE
JINGLE."  Eleanor awkwardly starts dancing in circles.

Andy gets excited and conducts FASTER.  Eleanor is sweating.
She dances faster.

Andy impatiently SPEEDS UP the MUSIC MORE.  Eleanor
desperately skips in circles, trying to keep up... when
suddenly she grabs her heart.

Eleanor stops -- and collapses.  She's down.

A horrified GASP from the crowd.  The band stops playing.
CREW MEMBERS run on from backstage.  One checks her heart.
She's not moving.  Zmuda runs out, horrified.

	Is there a doctor in the house??!

The crowd is stunned silent.  Pause -- then one man stands.

It's Michael.

Straight-faced, he hurries out of his seat, sprints down the
aisle, and goes on stage.  Michael checks her pulse and
loosens her blouse.  He presses Eleanor's chest, trying to
restart her heart.  But then -- he shakes his head sadly.
She's dead.

The crowd MOANS sadly.  Michael covers Eleanor with a
jacket.

Tony's wig, peach tux, and sunglasses are there... but Andy
is barely strong enough to bark out the attitude.

	How 'bout me and you dolls go get
	some REAL food:  French fries and a

Tony picks up a CHAIR and starts lifting it:  Up, down, up,

chair.

	Stop it!  C'mon, put that down.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Yeah, you're right.  We better get
	movin'.  We don't wanna miss Happy
	Hour at Kelbos -- all the Mai Tai's
	you can drink for $4.99.

Tony jauntily turns to exit.  He gestures to the ladies.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	Let's go!
		(he starts SINGING
		"New York, New
		York")
	"These vagabond blues,
	 Are washin' away.
	 I'll make a brand new start of
	it..."

Tony reaches the doorway -- and collapses.

He clutches himself in pain.

		LYNNE AND LITTLE WENDY
	Andy!!

Shocked, they run over.

Tony lies huddled on the ground.  He mutters sadly,
defeatedly.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Dammit...

					  CUT TO:

EXT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DUSK

The sun is setting, purple and orange over the hills.  Andy
and George lie on chaise lounges, serenely staring out.
Andy has a blank look on his face, and has lost more weight.
He is a shadow of himself.

		ANDY
	I can't move my arm.

		GEORGE
		(awkwardly)
	You've got good days and bad days.

Andy softly sighs.

		ANDY
	My hair is coming out.

		GEORGE
		(whispers)
	Yeah...

George silently pats Andy.  Andy's energy is sapped, but he
forces himself to be upbeat.

		ANDY
	I've got an idea for a new TV show
	for me to star in.  It's called
	"Uncle Andy's Fun House" -- it'll be
	a Saturday morning thing where I can
	goof off with the kids.  You know,
	puppets, magic tricks...

George is choked up.  He goes along with it.

		GEORGE
		(long pause)
	I think we can sell that.

Silence.

George struggles not to shatter Andy's enthusiasm.

Andy smiles gratefully.

		ANDY
	Hey... thanks for always backin' me.

George clenches Andy's hand.

		GEORGE
	Did your -- doctor say it's okay for
	you to go back to work?

		ANDY
	Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he
	had his way, I'd be stuck in the
	hospital, running tests all day.
		(beat)
	And anyway, I've found a new guy
	who's gonna be able to instantly
	remove the cancer.

		GEORGE
		(startled)
	Really?

		ANDY
	Yeah!  He's a psychic surgeon in the
	Philippines, and he's amazing!  He
	rubs you and sucks the disease right
	out!

Andy beams.  George stares sadly.

		GEORGE
	The Philippines?  I dunno... Andy...
	he sounds like one of your
	characters.

TIGHT - ANDY

His voice gets hushed.

		ANDY
	No... this guy's special.
		(very sincere)
	He performs miracles.

George doesn't know how to respond.

Andy looks up pleadingly.

		ANDY (cont'd)
	He's my last chance.

					  CUT TO:

EXT. BAGUIO CITY, PHILIPPINES - DAY

Baguio, a tiny scratched-in-the-dirt Philippine city.

Suddenly, a rattletrap COMMUTER PLANE lurches out of the
sky.  It hits a dirt runway.  Dust flies.  Chickens squawk
and run.

INT. BEAT UP TAXI, PHILIPPINES - DAY

Andy, Lynne, and Zmuda ride through the impoverished city.

Andy stares in amazement.

EXT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY

They reach a brick building.  A sign says "CLINIC," with an
eye over a triangle.

INT. CLINIC, PHILIPPINES - DAY

A NURSE hurriedly helps weakened Andy sign a bunch of forms.
Money is handed over.

Andy's clothes are stripped off.  They're thrown in a
locker.

INT. CLINIC OPERATION ROOM, PHILIPPINES - DAY

A large white tiled room.  Lynne and Zmuda roll in pallid
Andy, his limp body unmoving.

Andy looks up... and there's a LONG LINE OF SICKLY PEOPLE.
Primarily Japanese, emaciated, all stripped to their
underwear and barely able to stand.

They have a look of desperation and reverence.

At the head of the line is JUN ROXAS at his work station: A
bench, a sink, and ATTENDANTS with clean towels.

A SICKLY WOMAN crawls onto the bench.  Jun impassively
presses his hand into the fatty flesh of her stomach,
kneading, searching.  Pause, then he removes some BLOODY
GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The woman cries out.

Andy gasps.

The woman is helped away.

Jun turns to wash his hands.  An attendant gives him a towel
to dry with.  Then a SICKLY MAN crawls up...

Andy rolls closer.  He stares at all this with fear.
Nervousness.  Hope.

Jun impassively presses his hand against the man's head.  He
concentrates, searching... then pulls out some BLOODY GUTS.

He flings them into a bucket.

The man shakes.  He is helped away.

Andy is wide-eyed.  He gets closer... closer...

More patients.  More bloody guts.  More sobbing.

Andy's excitement builds.

Then -- he reaches the front.

A moment.

Lynne and Zmuda stare into Andy's eyes, drawn in by his
total belief.  They are overcome.  It feels like they're
saying goodbye.  Lynne gives Andy a tender kiss.  Zmuda
starts to shake his hand -- and instead hugs him tightly.

Andy smiles, then the attendants lift him from the
wheelchair.  They help him up to the bench.

Andy lies down.  Fluorescent lights buzz overhead.

He looks over, and Jun Roxas is washing his hands from the
previous patient.

Andy shivers, anticipating the miracle.

Jun turns.  An attendant gives him a towel to dry off.

Andy relaxes, readying for it all...

He glances at Jun's hands.  Jun hands back the towel -- and
under it the attendant quickly slips Jun a sack of animal
intestines.

Jun discreetly palms it.  He's a fake.

CLOSEUP - ANDY

A moment of stunned disbelief.

He is shocked.  Outraged.  Disappointed.  Flabbergasted.

The faith is meaningless.  The joke is cosmic.  The con man
has been conned.

Andy's overpowering emotions coalesce... and he starts to
LAUGH.

It's sidesplittingly funny.  Andy LAUGHS, and LAUGHS, and
LAUGHS, like a crazy man with no salvation, the joy
releasing him, the tears rolling down his cheeks.

His face flushes with color.  Life sparkles in his eyes.
Andy laughs and guffaws until he's hoarse.  This is the best
gag of them all.

				 SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Andy lies in peace in a casket.  He has died.

His expression is pleasantly bland.  Almost Latka-like.  But
his face is caked with so much funeral-home makeup, it
almost looks like a mask.

We slowly widen.  The casket is surrounded by beautiful
flowers.  We TILT UP... and high above... is a MOVIE SCREEN.

On the SCREEN is a projection of Andy, silently staring at
us.  There's a gentle smile on his face.  It's the image
from the opening of this film.

ANDY'S POV: The chapel is filled with GRIEVING MOURNERS.
All are in black.  Everyone's quiet, in a state of shock.

Andy's family is huddled.

Lynne sits alone in a pew, crying.

George gives Zmuda a hug.  Little Wendy comes over... and
they comfort each other.

Everyone who ever knew Andy is there: Taxi cast, Fridays
cast, TM followers, hookers, Jerry Lawler, Ed Weinberger,
Maynard Smith, Budd Friedman, it goes on and on...

And -- they all have odd discombobulated expressions.  They
stare up at the PROJECTED ANDY.

		ANDY (ON FILM)
	Well... My show is over.  I did my
	best, and I just want to say, until
	we meet again... please remember:
		(he begins to SING)
	"In this friendly, friendly world...
	 With each day so full of joy.
	 Why should any heart be lonely."

Some gathered people tentatively join in the SINGING.

		ANDY (ON FILM) (cont'd)
	So everybody!  Put your arm around
	the person next to you, even if you
	don't like that person.  Come on!
		(he resumes SINGING)
	"The world is such a wonderful
	place,
	To wander through,
	When you've got someone to love,
	To wander along with you.
	With the sky so full of stars,
	And the river so full of songs,
	Every heart should be so thankful,
	Thankful for this friendly, friendly
	world..."

The curtain behind the coffin OPENS and the casket with
Andy's body slowly slides into the DARKNESS.

The curtain closes.  The FILM ENDS.

And all goes silent.

Some people cry.  Some begin to leave.  Most of them are
just staying, numbed.

George and Zmuda whisper.

		GEORGE
	It's a perfect Kaufman audience.

		ZMUDA
	Yeah.  They don't know whether to be
	sad, or angry.

The Taxi cast are flustered.

		CAROL KANE
	Why are people leaving?  The
	curtain's gonna open.  Andy's gonna
	come out... I know it!

		TONY DANZA
	Sure, the body was just made of
	wax...!
		(a very long beat)
	Wasn't it......?

Silence.  They look to the front.

The closed curtain wafts... then settles motionless.

					FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. SUNSET BLVD./COMEDY STORE - NIGHT

A SUPER slowly appears:  "EXACTLY ONE YEAR LATER"

On Sunset, TWO DUDES come riding along on skateboards.
Suddenly they reach -- INSANITY.  Traffic on Sunset is
jammed.  HONKING limousines jockey to squeeze by.

Confused, one Dude squints into the distance -- and his eyes
pop.

		DUDE #2
	Oh my GOD.
		(stupefied)
	That's the freakiest thing I've ever
	seen!!  Look!

He points.  His friend turns -- and gasps.

AT THE COMEDY STORE - The marquee says "TONY CLIFTON: LIVE!"

		DUDE #1
	Man, we were right!  He's not dead!

		DUDE #2
	He's just been lyin' low for a year!
	WE GOTTA GO!

Hysterical, the guys race up to the club.  But outside,
there's a CRAZED, PULSING MOB.  People are screaming.
Police have barricades.  Everybody cries to get in.

INT. COMEDY STORE - SAME TIME

It's packed.  Every square inch is filled with glittery
Hollywood VIPs.  People make chit-chat... but there is a
squeamish excitement in the air.  A brooding unease.  Nobody
knows what to expect.

Suddenly -- the lights go black.  A BOOMING ANNOUNCER.

		ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
	Ladies and Gentlemen!  Please put
	your hands together for... Tony
	Clifton!

The THEME FROM 2001 starts playing.  "DAAAAA, DAAAAA,
DAAAAA!  DA-DAAAAA"!

A small SPOT appears -- on a peach tuxedo.  The light grows
bigger, bigger... the tension magnifying... people
gasping... our view widening... until Tony Clifton is
revealed onstage!

It's an extraordinary theatrical moment -- without response.
The crowd has no idea what to do.

Tony smirks.

		TONY CLIFTON
	How ya doin'?

Dead silence.

Tony struts downstage.  He waves to the crowd.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	How you doin' back there?!
		(to the front rows)
	How you doin' up here?!

Still no response.  Until -- a lone reckless VOICE.

		VOICE
	Andy!

Whoa.  The crowd rustles nervously.

Tony grimaces.

		TONY CLIFTON
	Don't know nothin' about no Andy.
	Just some dead guy tryin' to ride my
	coattails.
		(to the BAND)
	Let's HIT IT, boys!  One, two, anda
	one two three four!

The BAND kicks in with disco anthem "I WILL SURVIVE."  Tony
starts SINGING the schmaltzy opening:

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"First I was afraid
	 I was petrified.
	 Kept thinkin' I could never live
	 Without you at my side."
		(he wipes away a
		pretend tear)
	"Were you the one that tried to
	 Hurt me with goodbye?
	 Did you think I'd crumble?
	 Did you think I'd lay down and
	 Die...?"

We PAN the room full of enthralled spectators.  At a front
table are George and Lynne.

Tony attacks the chorus.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"Oh no not I!
	 I WILL SURVIVE!
	 As long as I know how to love,
	 I know I'll simply stay alive!"

In the crowd, we pass face after face -- smiling...
frowning... intrigued... confused... until we settle on a
man in the very last row.

Bob Zmuda.

Enjoying the show more than anyone.

		TONY CLIFTON (cont'd)
	"I've got all my life to live
	 I've got all my life to give.
	 I will survive..."
		(he hits his big
		finish)
	"I -- WILL -- SURVIVE!!!"

The music CRESCENDOS, and the song ENDS.

Zmuda grins and APPLAUDS proudly.

					FADE OUT.
THE END
The Man Who Wasn't There

 

                                "THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE"

                                            BY

                                  Ethan Coen & Joel Coen

                

               Black.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But 
                         I never considered myself a barber...

               We track back from a barber's pole.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I stumbled into it--well, married 
                         into it more precisely...

               We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening 
               door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head 
               of a customer entering in slow motion.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I wasn't my establishment. Like 
                         the fella says, I only work here...

               We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, 
               aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The dump was 200 feet square, 
                         with five chairs, or stations as we 
                         call 'em, even though there were 
                         only two of us working...

               We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across 
               a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one 
               hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, 
                         was the principal barber. And man, 
                         could he talk...

               Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers 
               across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now maybe if you're eleven or 
                         twelve years old, Frank's got an 
                         interesting point of view, but 
                         sometimes it got on my nerves. Not 
                         that I'd complain, mind you. Like I 
                         said, he was the principal barber.  
                         Frank's father August--they called 
                         him Guzzi--had worked the heads up 
                         in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years 
                         until his ticker stopped in the middle 
                         of a Junior Flat Top. He left the 
                         shop to Frankie free and clear. And 
                         that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's 
                         ambitions: cutting the hair and 
                         chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk 
                         much...

               He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into 
               a tray.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I just cut the hair...

               LATE IN THE DAY

               The barbershop is empty of customers. Late sun slants in 
               through the front window. The two barbers--the narrator and 
               his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly 
               reading magazines.

                                     FRANK
                         Says here that the Russians exploded 
                         n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing 
                         we can do about it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         How d'ya like them apples?

               Beat.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed?

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     FRANK
                         Russians exploded an A-bomb.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus...

                         Now, being a barber is a lot like 
                         being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's 
                         not much to it once you've learned 
                         the basic moves. For the kids there's 
                         the Butch, or the Heinie...

               We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:

                         the Vanguard, the Junior Contour 
                         and, occasionally, the Executive 
                         Contour. Adults get variations on 
                         the same, along with the Duck Butt, 
                         the Timberline...

               Ed trims the fringe around a balding head.

                         ...and something we call the Alpine 
                         Rope Toss.

               He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes 
               it across a bald pate.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I lived in a little bungalow on 
                         Napa Street. The place was OK, I 
                         guess; it had an electric ice box, 
                         gas hearth, and a garbage grinder 
                         build into the sink. You might say I 
                         had it made.

               We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as 
               a black coupe pulls into the driveway.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Oh yeah. There was one other 
                         thing...

               We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting 
               on a girdle.

                         store on Main Street. Unlike me, 
                         Doris liked the work, accounting; 
                         she liked knowing where everything 
                         stood. And she got a ten per cent 
                         employee discount on whatever she 
                         wanted--nylon stockings...

               Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to 
               the garter.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...make-up, and perfume...

               Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia 
               by Tuvache.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She wore a lot of perfume.

               Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee 
               table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster, 
                         was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the 
                         department store heiress. Tonight 
                         they were coming over for dinner--as 
                         Doris said, we were 'entertaining'...

               Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable 
               suit, smoking.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Me, I don't like entertaining.

               The doorbell rings.

               THE DOOR

               Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure, 
               bird-like wife.

                                     DAVE
                         How ya doin', Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK. Take your coat, Ann?

               DINNER TABLE

               The two couples are in the middle of the meal.

                                     DAVE
                         Japs had us pinned down in Buna for 
                         something like six weeks. Well, I 
                         gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it 
                         tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. 
                         *They* were eating grubs, nuts, 
                         thistles. When we finally up and 
                         bust off the beach we found Arnie 
                         Bragg, kid missing on recon; the 
                         Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if 
                         you'll pardon the, uh... And this 
                         was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' 
                         to write home about. I mean, I never 
                         would've, ya know, so what do I say, 
                         honey? When I don't like dinner, 
                         what do I say?

               Ann smiles wanly.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg--
                         *again*?!

               He roars with laughter.

               Ed gives an acknowledging smile.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!

               He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Were you in the service, Ed?

                                     ED
                         No, Dave, I wasn't.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed was 4F on account of his fallen 
                         arches.

                                     DAVE
                         Mm, that's tough.

               FRONT PORCH

               Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down. 
               Crickets chirp. From inside the house we hear laughter and 
               clattering dishes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all 
                         that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had 
                         the feeling that she and Big Dave 
                         were a lot closer than they let on...

               He turns and looks through the screen door into the house.

               Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly 
               lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the 
               counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter 
               while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing 
               dishes across.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The signs were all there plain 
                         enough--not that I was gonna prance 
                         about it, mind you. It's a free 
                         country.

               Footsteps approach the front porch.

               With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges.

                                     DAVE
                         Holding down the porch area?

               Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes, 
               forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front 
               lawn.

                                     DAVE
                         ...That's quite a wife you got there.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         She's a rare one.

                                     ED
                         How's business, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Couldn't be better. These're boom 
                         times in retailing. We're opening 
                         another store, Big Dave's Annex, 
                         there on Garson. This is strictly 
                         haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, 
                         ladies' foundations and undergarments. 
                         Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making 
                         Doris the comptroller. How're things 
                         at the, uh, the barbershop?

                                     ED
                         All right, I guess.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want 
                         to drop by the Annex when we open, 
                         update your suit--'course, you're in 
                         the smock all day.

               He chuckles.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Say, where do you get those things 
                         anyway?

                                     ED
                         Specialty store down in Sacramento.

                                     DAVE
                         Uh-huh.

               There is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big 
               Dave clears his throat.

               CHURCH

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I went to church once a 
                         week...

               We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting 
               the resurrection of Christ.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Usually Tuesday night...

               Faintly, we hear an amplified voice:

                                     CALLER
                         I... seven...

               Ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit 
               cigarette in his mouth.

                                     CALLER
                         ...Bee... Four...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris wasn't big on divine worship...

               Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of 
               her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and I doubt if she believed in 
                         life everlasting; she'd most likely 
                         tell you that our reward is on this 
                         earth and bingo is probably the extent 
                         of it...

               Still focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed:

                                     DORIS
                         Watch your card, honey.

                                     CALLER
                         I... sixteen...

               Ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from 
               his cigarette.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I wasn't crazy about the game, but, 
                         I don't know, it made her happy, and 
                         I found the setting peaceful.

                                     CALLER
                         Gee... nine...

               Doris sucks in her breath.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus, bingo--BINGO!

               BARBERSHOP

               Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. 
               Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, 
               a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the 
               vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I 
                         mean, if you're really serious. You 
                         tie your own flies, you do a--I know 
                         it's matickless, I know, people say, 
                         hey, you can buy flies at the store--
                         but you can buy your fish at the 
                         store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         The point is there's a certain art 
                         to the process. The point is not 
                         merely to provide, and let me point 
                         out, these fish are not as dumb as 
                         you might think.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Sportsmanship! That's my point. June 
                         fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? 
                         Well, what fish do you seek?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Sure, go to the store. Go there, 
                         describe to the man where you will 
                         be fishing, and for what, and the 
                         weather conditions, sun, no sun, 
                         whatnot, and so forth, and then you 
                         might as well have the man go ahead 
                         and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...

               We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows 
               at the far end of the shop. He is almost blown out by the 
               late-day sunlight hitting the window.

                                     FRANK
                         ...My point is, this is a man who 
                         knows nothing no matter how much you 
                         tell him, so sell him the goddamn 
                         FISH, Ed.

               The bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle-
               aged man walks in. He is well dressed--perhaps a little too 
               snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil 
               mustache.

                                     MAN
                         OK, boys, which of you gets the 
                         privilege?

                                     FRANK
                         We're just closing, friend.

                                     MAN
                         Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing 
                         well enough to turn away business! 
                         More power to ya, brother! The public 
                         be damned!

                                     FRANK
                         Hey, what's your problem, friend? 
                         This is a business establishment 
                         with posted hours--

               Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head.

                                     ED
                         I'll take care of him, go ahead, 
                         Frank. Have a seat, mister.

               Frank looks sourly at the stranger.

                                     FRANK
                         ...You sure, Eddie?

                                     ED
                         Yeah, yeah--go home.

               As Frank leaves:

                                     FRANK
                         In your ear, mister.

               The stranger chuckles.

                                     STRANGER
                         Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! 
                         Not so fast there, brother--

               Ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him 
               back; he lifts off a toupee.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the 
                         experts. 100 percent human hair, 
                         handcrafted by Jacques of San 
                         Francisco, and I'd hate to have to 
                         tell you what I paid for it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     STRANGER
                         Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for 
                         it down on the installment plan...

               Ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...A lot of folks live with the pate 
                         exposed. They say the dames think 
                         it's sexy. But for my money it's 
                         just not good grooming--and grooming, 
                         my friend, is probably the most 
                         important thing in business--after 
                         personality, of course...

               He twists around to offer his hand.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to 
                         know ya.

                                     ED
                         Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa 
                         Rosa?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         A goose, friend. I was chasing a 
                         wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard 
                         of venture capital?

                                     ED
                         Uh--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, it's the wildest goose there 
                         is. Risk money. Very speculative. 
                         Except, Ed, in certain situations, 
                         it's not, see? I thought I had a 
                         prospect here. Well, I make the haul 
                         up and this lousy so-and-so tells me 
                         his situation has changed--all his 
                         capital's gonna be tied up in 
                         expansion plans of his own. Thank 
                         you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! 
                         It's only the biggest business 
                         opportunity since Henry Ford and I 
                         can't seem to interest a soul!

                                     ED
                         That right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         It's called dry cleaning. You heard 
                         me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'--
                         wash without water, no suds, no 
                         tumble, no stress on the clothes. 
                         It's all done with chemicals, friend, 
                         and your garments end up crisp and 
                         fresh. And here's the capper: no 
                         shrinkage.

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         That's right! Dry cleaning--remember 
                         the name. It's going to revolutionize 
                         the laundry industry, and those that 
                         get in early are gonna bear the fruit 
                         away. All I need is $10,000 to open 
                         my first store, then I use its cash 
                         flow to finance another, and so on--
                         leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole 
                         chain. Well, me and a partner. 
                         Cleanliness, friend. There's money 
                         in it. There's a future. There's 
                         room to grow... Say, that's looking 
                         pretty good. Let's see it with the 
                         hairpiece on...

               BATHROOM DOORWAY

               It is evening. Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb 
               contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a 
               cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Dry cleaning...

               The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Was I crazy to be thinking about 
                         it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity, 
                         the real McCoy?

               Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...My first instinct was, no, no, 
                         the whole idea was nuts. But maybe 
                         that was the instinct that kept me 
                         locked up in the barbershop, nose 
                         against the exit, afraid to try 
                         turning the knob. What if I could 
                         get the money?

                                     DORIS
                         Honey?

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.

                                     DORIS
                         Shave my legs, will ya?

               Ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette 
               back in his mouth to free his hands. He picks up a bar of 
               soap and starts soaping the leg.

               He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor.

               The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark 
               bits of hair flecking the white foam.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was clean. No water. Chemicals.

               He shakes the razor in the tub. Shavings float away across 
               the soap-slicked water.

                                     DORIS
                              (absently, as she 
                              reads)
                         Gimme a drag.

               Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, 
               uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris 
               as she sucks.

               He brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to 
               his own mouth. She murmurs:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Love ya, honey.

               A DOOR

               We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into 
               laughter.

               A hand enters to knock.

                                     VOICE
                         Yeah, come in.

               The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves 
               sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. A tray of room-
               service dishes sits near him.

               He is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (into the phone)
                         OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

               He hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Oh, I thought you were the 
                         porter... Can I help you?

               Ed stands awkwardly by the door.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm, uh, Ed.

               The stranger's look does not show recognition.

                                     ED
                         ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at 
                         a disadvantage.

                                     ED
                         I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Jesus! The barber! I'll be a 
                         sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 
                         'Course--the barber.

               Ed nods, his smile faint and forced.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...I didn't recognize you without 
                         the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave 
                         something at the shop?

                                     ED
                         No. I might be interested in that, 
                         uh, business proposition--

               Creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and 
               arranges it on his head.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         You got the dough?!

                                     ED
                         I can get it, yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Come in, come in, siddown over there. 
                         Coffee?

                                     ED
                         No. I--tell me--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sure.

                                     ED
                         What's involved, aside from putting 
                         up the money? What're you looking 
                         for the partner to do?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want 
                         to keep tabs on your investment, of 
                         course, but I'm looking for a silent 
                         partner. I've done the research, 
                         I've contacted the vendors, the deal 
                         is set. I'm just looking for venture 
                         capital, friend. Disappear if you 
                         want, check in whenever you like--I 
                         want the dough; I don't take 
                         attendance.

                                     ED
                         And how do we share--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. 
                         You and me. Finance and expertise. 
                         So--you've got the dough then, do 
                         ya?

                                     ED
                         I'll have it in a week.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, I'll be damned. The barber! 
                         And I thought this trip was a bust. 
                         Well...

               He reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand 
               and hands Ed a glass.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...it just goes to show, when one 
                         door slams shut, another one opens. 
                         Here's to ya, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

               They both knock back the whiskey. Creighton leans back and 
               gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, 
               his hairpiece slightly askew.

               Ed stares back.

               After a beat, without taking his eyes of Ed, Creighton reaches 
               up and loosens his tie. An almost imperceptible wink.

               Ed stares.

                                     ED
                         ...Was that a pass?

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (hoarsely)
                         Maybe.

                                     ED
                         You're out of line, mister.

               Creighton throws up his hands apologetically.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         No problem!

                                     ED
                         Way out of line.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Right! Strictly business.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

               CLOSE ON TYPEWRITTEN NOTE

               It says:

               I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DORIS CRANE.  COOPERATE OR ED CRANE 
               WILL KNOW.  YOUR WIFE WILL KNOW. EVERYONE WILL KNOW. GATHER 
               $10,000 AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.

               A hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I sent it to Dave the next morning. 
                         And I waited.

               BARBERSHOP

               We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-old's crew 
               cut as clippers buzz its perimeter.

               Frank reads a magazine. The youngster reads a comic as Ed 
               works his head.

                                     ED
                         Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         Huh?

                                     ED
                         This hair.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah.

                                     ED
                         ...You ever wonder about it?

                                     FRANK
                         Whuddya mean?

                                     ED
                         I don't know... How it keeps on 
                         coming. It just keeps growing.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?

                                     ED
                         No, I mean it's growing, it's part 
                         of us. And we cut it off. And throw 
                         it away.

                                     FRANK
                         Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare 
                         the kid.

               Ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap.

                                     ED
                         OK, bud, you're through.

               The kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out 
               the door. Ed gives Frank a considering stare.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw 
                         it out in the dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the--

                                     ED
                         I'm gonna mingle it with common house 
                         dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the hell are you talking about?

               Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers.

                                     ED
                         I don't know. Skip it.

               EXT. ED'S HOUSE

               It is twilight. Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and, 
               cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk.

               Music filters out from the house.

               INT. ED'S HOUSE

               Ed walks though the living room, hands in his pockets. The 
               music emanates from a radio in the bedroom.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed?

               A track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her 
               hair. Her dress is half zipped at the back.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Gimme a zip.

               Ed walks over behind her.

                                     ED
                         Where you going?

                                     DORIS
                         Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I 
                         told you last week, for the Christmas 
                         Push.

                                     ED
                         Yeah, right.

               We are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, 
               the lowers it slightly. Her back blooms through the dark 
               fabric of the dress.

               He slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume 
               atomizer.

                                     DORIS
                         Come on, get ready. It's important.

                                     ED
                         Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.

                                     DORIS
                         Oh, don't be a grump.

               SALES FLOOR

               It is festooned with streamers.

               Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the 
               other bringing a cigarette to his lips.

               Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the 
               dance floor. Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms 
               over their knees.

               A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching, 
               his Adam's apple bobbing.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Wild, man!

               He goes out onto the dance floor. Ed, left by himself, gazes 
               across the floor.

               His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly 
               talking to Doris.

               Doris reacts angrily.

               Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris. He 
               glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation. 
               He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.

                                     VOICE
                         You in ladies' wear?

               The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at 
               the floor, snapping his fingers.

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Haven't I seen you up in ladies' 
                         wear?

                                     ED
                         I don't work here. My wife does.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Check out the rack on that broad in 
                         the angora.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               A hand is laid on Ed's shoulder. It is Big Dave; he leans in 
               to murmur:

                                     DAVE
                         Ed. Can I talk to you?

               BIG DAVE'S OFFICE

               Music from the party drifts in only faintly. The office is 
               built into a corner of the sales floor. It is dominated by a 
               large desk. A large window on the far side affords a partial 
               view of the floor.

                                     DAVE
                         Siddown. Siddown...

               Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. Dave fumbles 
               nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. He trims the end 
               of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel 
               grip.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Souveniered it off a Jap in New 
                         Guinea.

               He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags 
               up a chair to face Ed's.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I guess you're wondering what 
                         Doris was so hot about.

               The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the 
               window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave. Ed leans 
               forward for Dave to light his cigar.

                                     DAVE
                         ...These're Havanas. Romeo and 
                         Juliets. Private stock.

               Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Ed, I...

                                     ED
                         What is it, Dave?

               Dave breaks down, weeping. He buries his face in his hands, 
               the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his 
               hair.

                                     DAVE
                         Ed, I've been weak...

               His shoulders heave.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.

               Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been 
                         carrying on with a married woman. 
                         Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--
                         what is it they say?--the--the--the 
                         chickens are coming home to roost.

               Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, 
                         uh, that's not the worst of it. I 
                         got a note. A blackmail note. You 
                         know, come across or everybody knows.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, you know what that would do to 
                         me.

                                     ED
                         I guess it would be pretty awkward.

                                     DAVE
                         Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my 
                         keister! Hell, it's her family's 
                         store--*her* store. I serve at the 
                         indulgence of the goddamn ownership, 
                         Ed.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         I only work here! And the lady's 
                         husband would know... Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         How much to they want, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         $10,000! I don't know what to do, 
                         Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. 
                         Even though I know who the sonofabitch 
                         is.

                                     ED
                         ...You know... who *who* is?

                                     DAVE
                         The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. 
                         It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's 
                         a businessman from Sacramento. A 
                         goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope 
                         me into some crackpot scheme; I heard 
                         him out and then told him to go to 
                         hell. And the very next day, the 
                         very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed 
                         for the same amount.

                                     ED
                         Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, I guess he don't care that 
                         it's obvious.

                                     ED
                         Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--

                                     DAVE
                         He's staying at the hotel I've gone 
                         to with, uh, with the lady in 
                         question. Must've seen us.

               Big Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Thanks...

               He exhales with a long sigh.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         That's my capitalization on the Annex! 
                         *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. 
                         That's what I was just talking to 
                         Doris about, a way of getting the 
                         money from the store that we could 
                         hide from Ann.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn 
                         wife!

               He give a tearful chuckle.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Doris, she was pretty hot about 
                         that. God bless her. She doesn't 
                         know I'm telling you this--she's mad 
                         enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're 
                         the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm 
                         sorry I... I better get back to the 
                         party.

               He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his 
               face.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I look all right?

               PULLING ED

               He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room 
               lit only by spill from the party. It is the music department; 
               pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I 
                         knew the ten grand was going to pinch 
                         him where it hurt...

               Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. He takes 
               out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But Doris was two-timing me and I 
                         guess, somewhere, that pinched a 
                         little too.

               His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone 
               is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room.

               The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three-
               quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of 
               haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play.

               Ed listens. The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby.

               The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and 
               Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his 
               face.

               The piece ends.

                                     ED
                         That was pretty.

               The player turns, surprised. It is a young woman.

                                     ED
                         ...Did you make that up?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig 
                         van Beethoven.

               Ed nods recognition of the name.

                                     ED
                         That was quite something.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.

                                     ED
                         That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I know who you are, Mr Crane.

               His look shows surprise.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...My father used to take me with 
                         him when he got his hair cut. Walter 
                         Abundas?

               Ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls 
                         me Birdy.

                                     ED
                         Sorry, I just didn't remember.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, that's all right. You can't be 
                         expected to remember every skinny 
                         girl who comes in with her dad.

               Ed give a wry smile.

                                     ED
                         ...You don't like the music out there?

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. 
                         I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

               A woman calls sharply from offscreen:

                                     VOICE
                         Ed.

               He looks.

               Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat 
               over her arm, purse in hand.

               ED'S CAR

               Doris and Ed are driving home.

               Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at 
               the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     DORIS
                         Dave.

                                     ED
                         How's that?

                                     DORIS
                         Ahh...

               She waves angrily.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Money problems. He's thinking 
                         about canceling the Annex.

                                     ED
                         So?

                                     DORIS
                         *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               They ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

               STREET

               As the car roars past and into the distance.

               ANOTHER STREET

               It is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a 
               hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a 
               Packard and drives off.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Big Dave did it, though...

               Ed, sitting in his car, is watching.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sent a note telling him where 
                         to drop the money...

               HOTEL HALLWAY

               Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray 
               by the elevator.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and he did. He came across.

               Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and 
               pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag.

               He goes back to the stairwell.

               ANOTHER FLOOR

               Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks.

               The door swings open.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...

               Ed follows him into the room.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...You bring a check?

                                     ED
                         Cash.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Cash?!

               He gives Ed a look.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Usually we do this kind of thing 
                         with a bank draft. But cash--that's 
                         fine--it's all the same in the end--
                         dough's dough, huh?

                                     ED
                         Sure.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         I got the paperwork here. Partnership 
                         papers here, they reflect our 
                         agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I 
                         supply professional services, you 
                         supply the capital. I'll give you a 
                         receipt on the dough there, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Pretty straightforward, but I don't 
                         know if you wanna show this stuff to 
                         a lawyer--

                                     ED
                         It's OK.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to 
                         tangle it up and then you pay 'em to 
                         untangle it, what's the point?

               He perspires as he counts the money.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Just a second here, I'll give you 
                         a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, 
                         Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't 
                         talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm 
                         gonna call the place Tolliver's, 
                         after me, you know, I didn't think 
                         you were much interested in, uh--

                                     ED
                         That'll be fine.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...

               He wipes his brow, finishes counting.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Yeah, that's it. As per our 
                         discussion.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, there it is. Writ large in 
                         legal escriture, next step is--

                                     ED
                         Look, uh... Creighton...

               He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the 
               cigarette planted in his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...You're not gonna screw me on this?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a 
                         lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* 
                         cleaning, this is not some fly-by-
                         night thing here! I must say, I've 
                         been an entrepreneur for thirteen 
                         years and I've never--

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         And I've never been asked--Look, you 
                         want the dough back? You know who I 
                         am! You--

                                     ED
                         OK.

               Creighton mops his brow again.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?

               CAR

               Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth. Doris sits 
               next to him. Rural scenery slips by in the background.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The next day was Saturday. We were 
                         going to a reception for Doris' cousin 
                         Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner 
                         out near Modesto. Doris didn't much 
                         feel like going, and I didn't either, 
                         but, like she said, we had a 
                         Commitment.

               Doris gazes stonily out at the road. At length:

                                     DORIS
                         ...I hate wops.

               Ed gives her a brief glance. Doris glares at him.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What's so damn strange about that?

                                     ED
                         I didn't say a word.

               She looks back out at the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...*You* didn't have to grow up with 
                         'em.

               This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Family. Boy.

               BY A BARN

               Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled 
               with food.

               A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and 
               screams:

                                     CHILD
                         He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's 
                         ridin' Garibaldi!

               Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung 
               over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig. He slaps 
               at the pig's ass with a large straw hat.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         That was when she started drinking.

               Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine 
               from a water glass. Ed stands nearby.

               A large woman hugs Doris.

                                     WOMAN
                         How you doin', Doris, you been OK?

                                     DORIS
                         How're you, Constanza?

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And 
                         how you been, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Ed. How's a business?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Doris)
                         He's a barber, right? It's a good 
                         trade. So how come you got no kids?

               PICNIC TABLE

               A group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a 
               picnic table set out with pies in a row.

                                     VOICES
                         Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for 
                         Frankie!

                                     FRANK
                         No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!

                                     VOICES
                         No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!

               An old man stands by with a stopwatch.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Ready...

               He clicks the timer.

                                     OLD MAN
                         ...Go!

               Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the 
               line of blueberry pies.

               The other picnickers cheer them on.

               ELSEWHERE

               Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple 
               accepting congratulations.

               Doris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk:

                                     DORIS
                         'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn 
                         wonderful.

                                     ED
                         Congratulations, Gina.

                                     DORIS
                         Life is so goddamn wonderful, you 
                         almost won't believe it.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

                                     DORIS
                         It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, 
                         I'm sure.

               Ed tries to lead her away.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

               Doris calls back over her shoulder:

                                     DORIS
                         Congratulations on your goddamn 
                         cherries!

               As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Leggo my goddamn elbow.

               ELSEWHERE

               In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering 
               slowly, painfully, toward a tree. In his right hand he 
               clutches a trophy.

               When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against 
               it, leans forward, and vomits.

               CAR

               Late afternoon, driving home.

               Ed drives. Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring 
               lightly. Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to 
               his chest, eyes closed, murmuring:

                                     FRANK
                         I never wanna see another blueberry 
                         pie...

               Silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...I never even wanna hear those 
                         words.

               Doris moans.

               More silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Don't says those words, Ed.

               EXT. BUNGALOW

               It is twilight. Ed's coupe is parked in the driveway. He is 
               just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side 
               door. He pulls Doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris, 
               who has one arm draped around his neck. He helps her into 
               the bedroom and eases her onto the bed.

               He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her.

               Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face. She 
               is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with 
               perspiration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I'd met Doris blind on a double-date 
                         with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who 
                         was seeing a friend of hers from 
                         work. We went to a movie; Doris had 
                         a flask; we killed it. She could put 
                         it away. At the end of the night she 
                         said she liked it I didn't talk much. 
                         A couple weeks later she suggested--

               A harsh jangle from the telephone. Doris moans but does not 
               wake; Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the 
               phone.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE
                         Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to 
                         you.

                                     ED
                         What--now?

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

                                     ED
                         But it's...

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

               Ed sighs.

                                     ED
                         Your place?

                                     DAVE
                         I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself 
                         in.

                                     ED
                         OK.

               He hangs up.

               He nudges Doris.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She murmurs.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She rolls away and burrows into a pillow.

               Ed opens her purse and pokes through it.

               NIRDLINGER'S

               We are looking over Ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings 
               open a door.

               It reveals Big Dave's office, quiet and rather dark.

               A down-facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates Big Dave's 
               hands on the desktop.

                                     ED
                         ...Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Come on in.

               Ed enters, sits.

               An awkward silence.

                                     ED
                         ...What's the problem, Big Dave?

               Another silence.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm ruined.

               His hands writhe on the desktop.

                                     DAVE
                         ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. 
                         I'm all shot to hell.

                                     ED
                         So you paid the guy?

               Big Dave stares without speaking.

               After a long beat:

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     DAVE
                         What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave--

                                     DAVE
                         I'd understand if you'd walked in 
                         here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. 
                         I deserved it.

                                     ED
                         I, uh...

                                     DAVE
                         I'm not proud of what I did. But 
                         *you*.

               No one talks.

               Big Dave sighs.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. 
                         And then I went and found the pansy.

               He looks at Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, 
                         well, you already know the story. I 
                         didn't, I hadda beat it out of the 
                         pansy. *Your* money.

               No response.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave rises.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Well.

               He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly:

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm all shot to hell.

               Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him. 
               Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall.

               Ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave. Big 
               Dave wallops him in the stomach. Ed doubles over.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face 
               against the desktop. Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the 
               desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. He slams 
               him face-first into the window between the office and the 
               dark sales floor.

               Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against 
               the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat.

               Big Dave sweats and strains.

               A crack shoots up the pane of glass.

               Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's 
               neck.

               Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up to 
               his throat.

               Ed watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer.

               Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his 
               head twisted away.

               He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face-
               down onto the floor.

               Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees 
               but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knees 
               awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something 
               across the floor with his nose.

               He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself 
               in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through 
               the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him.

               Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. His 
               whole body shakes as he goes into shock.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into the 
               corner, face-down. He is still.

               The room is very quiet.

               Ed looks down at his hands.

               He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks 
               across the darkened sales floor.

               EXT. STORE

               Ed walks to his car. He does not look about, is not 
               particularly furtive. He gets into the car. He starts the 
               ignition.

               EXT. HOUSE

               He pulls up, sits motionless for a beat. Gradually, something 
               draws his attention; he cocks his head and looks up through 
               the windshield.

               A branch creaks and sways in the breeze.

               INT. HOUSE

               Ed gets into bed next to Doris. He stares at the ceiling. 
               Wind rustles outside.

               The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the 
               wind.

               He looks at Doris.

               Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth 
               is closed now, her breathing more peaceful. The leafy shadows 
               play over her face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was only a couple of weeks 
                         after we met that Doris suggested 
                         getting married. I said, Don't you 
                         wanna get to know me more? She said, 
                         Why, does it get better? She looked 
                         at me like I was a dope, which I've 
                         never really minded from her. And 
                         she had a point, I guess. We knew 
                         each other as well then as now...

               He is gazing at her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, well enough.

               Sound and image face.

               BARBERSHOP

               The next day.

               Ed cuts hair, a cigarette between his lips.

                                     FRANK
                         Holy-moly, do I got a headache.

               Frank is giving a haircut as well.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How you today, Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     FRANK
                         You don't got a headache?

                                     ED
                         ...Nah.

                                     FRANK
                         Damn, I got a headache to beat the 
                         band.

               LATER

               Ed sits in his chair, hands folded in his lap, head tilted 
               back, eyes closed.

               We hold on Ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and Frank talking 
               to someone in his chair.

                                     FRANK
                         Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it? 
                         That'll just flood it.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold 
                         it down. *That'll* flood it.

                                     FRANK
                         You crazy? You pumped it?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Well, ya can't hold it down.

               There is the jingle of the door bell. Ed opens his eyes.

               Two men in fedoras are entering.

               Ed starts to rise.

                                     MAN 1
                         Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Right.

                                     MAN 1
                         Come on outside.

                                     ED
                         Sure.

               OUTSIDE

               The two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant 
               to speak. One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker:

                                     MAN 2
                         ...So you're a barber, huh?

                                     ED
                         That's right.

                                     MAN 1
                         I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.

               Ed nods toward their car:

                                     ED
                         ...We goin'?

                                     KREBS
                         Huh? No.

               Beat.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Cigarette?

               Ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette.

                                     PERSKY
                         Right. Uh... Pete's got some news 
                         for you.

               His partner gives Persky a dirty look.

                                     KREBS
                         ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, 
                         but, uh... well damnit, your wife's 
                         been pinched.

                                     PERSKY
                         They sent us to tell ya.

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         They sent us to tell ya. We pulled 
                         the detail.

                                     ED
                         My *wife*?

                                     PERSKY
                         Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county 
                         jail, uh...

                                     KREBS
                         Homicide.

                                     PERSKY
                         Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A 
                         guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... 
                         He's the decedent.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     KREBS
                         He's the dead guy.

               Ed stares at him.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Yeah, it's a tough break.

                                     KREBS
                         Visiting ends at five. Too late today. 
                         You can see her tomorrow.

                                     PERSKY
                         Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.

               He shakes his head.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Crap detail.

               RESIDENTIAL STREET

               It is evening. Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined 
               street similar to his own. He gets out of his car and goes 
               up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a 
               hand of greeting.

                                     MAN
                         'Lo, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Walter.

               He steps up on the porch.

               The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks 
               as the swing moves. His skin glistens with drinker's sweat, 
               and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's 
               put at least a couple away.

                                     WALTER
                         Have a seat.

               Ed glances around but the swing is the only seat. He sits 
               next to Walter.

                                     ED
                         Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at 
                         home.

                                     WALTER
                         Oh, hell. Drink?

                                     ED
                         No thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Sure you don't need one?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine.

                                     WALTER
                         OK. Boy. Jesus!

                                     ED
                         Yeah. What do I, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of 
                         my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, 
                         probate, real estate, title search, 
                         uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, 
                         something like this. Absolutely 
                         worthless.

               He belches.

                                     WALTER
                         'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. 
                         Frankly, Doris'd be better off with 
                         the county defender.

                                     ED
                         He a good man?

                                     WALTER
                         Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I 
                         won't kid you though, Ed, nobody 
                         around here has any experience with 
                         this kind of, er... And I hear they're 
                         bringing a prosecutor up from 
                         Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking 
                         it seriously... Hmm...

                                     ED
                         So--

                                     WALTER
                         Taking it seriously.

                                     ED
                         So, who should I--

               The front door opens and someone speaks through the screen:

                                     VOICE
                         You want any coffee, Dad?

               Ed looks around at the voice.

                                     VOICE
                         Oh, hello, Mr Crane.

               She steps out: it is Birdy Abundas.

               Ed rises, and they awkwardly shake hands.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Rachel.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

                                     ED
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Coffee, Ed?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         No thanks, honey.

                                     BIRDY
                         OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.

               They watch her go back in.

                                     WALTER
                         Damnit! She's a good kid.

               Ed nods.

               A beat.

                                     ED
                         ...So, uh, who should I--

                                     WALTER
                         Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San 
                         Francisco. Probity--you know, no one 
                         ever said anything iffy about Lloyd 
                         Garroway. Conservative. Jury might 
                         like that. Might like that here.

               He takes a sip of his drink.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Probity.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, 
                         uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, the best, the money-is-no-object 
                         best, for a criminal case, any lawyer 
                         would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. 
                         Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't 
                         know how you're fixed for money.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. He's the, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Yeah, the best.

               He sniffs.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I 
                         could tell you more. Hell, I wish I 
                         could handle it myself. But I'd be 
                         absolutely worthless for this kind 
                         of thing.

               He takes a musing sip.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Criminal matter? Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider.

               He thinks.

                                     WALTER
                         ...No question about it.

               ED AT A TABLE

               It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides, 
               one side for prisoners, the other for visitors. The room is 
               empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across 
               from a younger woman at the far end of the table. The younger 
               woman, in a prison smock, is wailing. The elderly woman is 
               holding her hand.

               Ed sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed 
               toiletries kit. There are echoing voices suggesting large 
               spaces outside the room.

               He sits and waits.

               Approaching footsteps.

               The door opens. A large prison matron steps aside to let 
               Doris enter.

               Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big 
               for her. Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled. Not only is 
               she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on 
               her lip.

               As Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around.

                                     ED
                         Honey... I brought your make-up.

               She looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Honey.

                                     ED
                         How are you?

               She shrugs.

                                     DORIS
                         I don't know what's going on. I--

                                     ED
                         What happened to you?

               She shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...I don't know what happened to Big 
                         Dave. I know some of it. 
                         Irregularities in my books, they 
                         said. Can I explain it.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to--

                                     DORIS
                         I helped him cook the books, Ed. I 
                         did do that.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell them anything. 
                         We're getting you a lawyer.

               Doris doesn't seem to be listening. She sighs:

                                     DORIS
                         I know all about that. But I don't 
                         know how much to tell them.

                                     ED
                         Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting 
                         you Freddy Riedenschneider.

               Doris finally looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Should I... should I tell you why?

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell me anything.

               Her gaze drifts away again. She notices the sobbing woman.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus Christ.

               Doris looks around and laughs.

                                     DORIS
                         ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone 
                         could open them up, make sense of 
                         the whole goddamn store.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

                                     DORIS
                         I knew we'd pay for it.

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock. Frank 
               paces in front of him. He smacks a fist into his palm.

                                     FRANK
                         This is what family is for, Ed! This 
                         is when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons 
                         of bitches!

                                     ED
                         Frank, uh, you know I'll try to 
                         contribute, but, uh--Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider--

                                     FRANK
                         I don't care what it costs! This is 
                         when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         That's very generous.

                                     FRANK
                         The hell with it, Eddie!

               BANK

               Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby. 
               Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit. As they 
               wait, he looks nervously about.

               In a hushed voice:

                                     FRANK
                         They're just people like you and me, 
                         Ed. Remember that.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Just people. They gotta put up the 
                         big front so that people will trust 
                         them with their money. This is why 
                         the big lobby, Ed. But they put their 
                         pants on one leg at a time. Just 
                         like you and me.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite 
                         of appearances. And their money will 
                         be secured by the barbershop. A rock. 
                         A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, 
                         how long has *this* place been here?

               A door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle 
               age emerges.

                                     MAN
                         Mr Raffo?

               Frank hops to his feet.

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Could you come with me please?

                                     FRANK
                         Sure. Can Ed come too?

               The man looks dubiously at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         Mr...?

                                     ED
                         Crane. Ed Crane.

                                     MAN
                         You also have an interest in the 
                         securing property?

                                     FRANK
                         He's a barber.

                                     MAN
                         Ah.

                                     FRANK
                         Second chair.

                                     MAN
                         Not an owner.

                                     FRANK
                         No, he's family, he's my brother-in-
                         law.

                                     MAN
                         Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited 
                         here.

               He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank 
               trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, and 
               we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the 
               words lost.

               Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of 
               business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped 
               to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes 
               successive documents across his desk with a word of 
               explanation for each as Frank signs.

               Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The barbershop. Doris and Frank's 
                         father had worked thirty years to 
                         own it free and clear. Now it got 
                         signed over to the bank, and the 
                         bank signed some money over to Frank, 
                         and Frank signed the money over...

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               It is midday. We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a 
               long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb. A couple of 
               kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is 
               no doubt the fanciest in town.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who 
                         got into town two days later...

               Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a 
               restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that 
               obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spells 
               out "DaVinci's".

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and told me to meet him at 
                         DaVinci's for lunch.

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               Inside the restaurant. We are tracking toward a table whose 
               lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu 
               as he orders from a facing waitress:

                                     MAN
                         ...not fried, poached. Three of 'em 
                         for two minutes. A strip steak medium 
                         rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato 
                         juice, and plenty of hot coffee.

               He flips the menu over.

                                     MAN
                         ...Do you have prairie oysters?

                                     WAITRESS
                         No, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Then bring me a fruit cocktail while 
                         I wait.

               He looks up at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         ...You're Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Yeah--

                                     MAN
                         Barber, right? I'm Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell 
                         me the chow's OK here. I made some 
                         inquiries.

                                     ED
                         No thanks, I--

               The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of 
               Riedenschneider.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Look, I don't wanna waste your time 
                         so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind?  
                         *You* don't mind. So while I'm in 
                         town I'll be staying at the Hotel 
                         Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, 
                         it's goofy, the suites're named after 
                         operas; room's OK though, I poked 
                         around. I'm having 'em hold it for 
                         me on account of I'll be back and 
                         forth. In addition to my retainer, 
                         you're paying hotel, living expenses, 
                         secretarial, private eye if we need 
                         to make inquiries, headshrinker should 
                         we go that way. We'll talk about 
                         appeals if, as and when. For right 
                         now, has she confessed?

                                     ED
                         No. Of course not. She didn't do it.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! That helps. Not that she didn't 
                         do it, that she didn't confess. Of 
                         course, there's ways to deal with a 
                         confession, but that's good!--one 
                         less thing to think about. Now. 
                         Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. 
                         You should be there. Three o'clock. 
                         One more thing: you keep your mouth 
                         shut. I get the lay of the land, I 
                         tell *you* what to say. No talking 
                         out of school. What's out of school? 
                         Everything's out of school. I do the 
                         talking; you keep your trap shut. 
                         I'm an attorney, you're a barber; 
                         you don't know anything. Understood?

                                     ED
                         ...OK.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! Any questions give me a ring--
                         Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a 
                         message. You sure you don't want 
                         anything? No?

               He points a finger at Ed.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's 
                         OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.

               The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And the flapjacks, honey.

               DRIVING POINT OF VIEW

               We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the 
               windshield of a moving car.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         All going about their business. It 
                         seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger 
                         one even then what had really happened 
                         to Big Dave, something none of them 
                         knew...

               On Ed, driving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Like I had made it to the outside, 
                         somehow, and they were all still 
                         struggling, way down below.

               ED IN BED

               Arms folded behind his head, staring at the ceiling.

               On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb.

               A distant, muffled knock.

               Ed turns his head.

               FRONT DOOR

               Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe.

               The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black: a 
               black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her 
               bird-like frame.

               Wind rustles in the trees behind her.

               She stares at Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann.

               For the first time, we hear her speak, in a low, tremulous 
               voice:

                                     ANN
                         Hello, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann. Will you come in?

               She shakes her head.

                                     ANN
                         ...No, No, it's very late.

               Ed nods.

               After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues to 
               stare:

                                     ED
                         ...I'm so sorry about your loss.

                                     ANN
                         Yes. Thank you.

                                     ED
                         Of course, you know, Doris had nothing 
                         to do with it. Nothing at all.

               She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm.

                                     ANN
                         Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came 
                         to tell you...

                                     ED
                         Yes, Ann?

                                     ANN
                         And you should tell Doris...

               She falls silent. The trees behind her rustle.

               She gives a wary look back. Then, confidingly, to Ed:

                                     ANN
                         ...You know how Big Dave loved 
                         camping. And the out-of-doors.

               Ed is puzzled:

                                     ED
                         Yes?

                                     ANN
                         We went camping last summer. In 
                         Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, 
                         Ed.

               She gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he 
               will find this significant.

                                     ED
                         ...Yes?

                         At night, there were lights--we both 
                         saw them. We never told anyone, 
                         outside of our official report.

                                     ED
                         Ann--

                         A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. 
                         They led Big Dave onto the craft. He 
                         never told anyone what they did, 
                         outside of his report. Of course he 
                         told *me*. No one else.

                                     ED
                         Ann--

                         The government knows. I cannot repeat 
                         it to you. But this thing goes deep, 
                         Ed. This was not your wife. I goes 
                         deep, and involves the government. 
                         There is a great deal of fear. You 
                         know how certain circles would find 
                         it--the knowledge--a threat. They 
                         try to limit it, and--

                                     ED
                         Ann, will you come in, sit down, 
                         maybe have a drink?

                                     ANN
                         Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. 
                         After this happened, things changed. 
                         Big Dave... he never touched me again.

               Ed says nothing.

               She touches his arm.

                                     ANN
                         ...Tell Doris not to worry. I know 
                         it wasn't her. Perhaps this will 
                         bring it out, finally. Perhaps now 
                         it will all come out.

               She turns and heads down the walk.

               Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk, 
               then are lost in the rustle of leaves.

               Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller.

               PRISON MEETING ROOM

               It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs. 
               One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight.

               Ed and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands 
               to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into 
               his pockets.

               All three are motionless for a long beat. Finally:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It stinks.

                                     DORIS
                         But it's true.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't care it's true, it's not 
                         true; it stinks. You say he was being 
                         blackmailed; by who? You don't know. 
                         For having an affair; with who? You 
                         don't know. Did anyone else know 
                         about it? Probably not; you don't 
                         know.

                                     ED
                         I knew about it. Big Dave told me 
                         about it, and the spot he was putting 
                         himself in by getting the money.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Terrific. Your husband backs you up. 
                         That's terrific.

               He starts pacing.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...You've gotta give me something to 
                         work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is 
                         good, but he's not a magician. He 
                         can't just wave his little wand in 
                         the air and make a plausible defense 
                         materialize. Look. Look at what the 
                         other side is gonna run at us. They 
                         got the company books, prepared by

                         They got a murder scene *you* had 
                         access to. That's Opportunity. They 
                         got that little trimmer thing he was 
                         stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* 
                         weapon--

                         It was Big Dave's.

                         --don't interrupt me--that's Means. 
                         They got a fine upstanding pillar of 
                         the business community as a victim, 
                         and then they got *you*, a disgruntled 
                         number-juggling underling who on the 
                         day in question was drunk as a skunk 
                         and whose alibi for the time in

               Riedenschneider gives him a hard look.

                         ...Like I say, it stinks.

               Another long pause.

                                     ED
                         ...I killed him.

               Riedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* 
                         killed him. How come?

                                     ED
                         He and Doris... were having an affair.

               Doris eyes him. His manner does not reveal anything.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         OK, how did you know?

                                     ED
                         I don't know. I don't think so.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         How did you get into the store?

                         I took Doris's keys.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone say they saw you there? 
                         On your way there? In there? On your 
                         was back?

                                     ED
                         ...I don't think so.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone corroborate and goddamn 
                         part of your story at all?

               Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare. Riedenschneider resumes 
               pacing.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Come on, people. You can't help 
                         each other like that. Let's be

               A nod of the head indicates Doris:

                         ...I cannot present Story B. I could 
                         plead you for a nutcase but you look 
                         too composed. I could offer a guilty 
                         plea and in return they don't give 
                         you the juice, but I don't think you 
                         want to spend the rest of your life 
                         in Chino and I know you didn't hire 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your 
                         hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell, 
                         you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway 
                         for that. No, we're not giving up 
                         yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, 
                         it means you're *not* throwing in 
                         the towel. I litigate, I don't 
                         capitulate. All right, no options, 
                         we gotta think. All right, we go 
                         back to the blackmail thing. It 
                         titillates, it's open ended...

               His pacing becomes more animated.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And it makes *him* the bad guy--
                         ya dig around, ya never know, 
                         something unsavory from his past, he 
                         approaches you to help with the money, 
                         it's too late, his past comes back 
                         to haunt him, who's to say...

               He is heading for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous 
                         husband thing, that's silly; we're 
                         going with the blackmail. I'll be in 
                         touch.

               The door slams.

               HOTEL LOBBY

               The camera drifts in toward the reception desk. Ed talks to 
               the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we 
               hear only Ed's narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Of course, there was *one* person 
                         who could confirm Doris's story, or 
                         plenty of it: the dry-cleaning 
                         pansy...

               The desk clerk is shaking his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But he'd left the hotel, skipped 
                         out on his bill...

               HALLWAY

               It is a rooming-house hallway. A stern middle-aged woman is 
               on the hall telephone. This too plays silently under the 
               narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He'd also disappeared from the 
                         residence he gave me...

               ED'S LIVING ROOM

               We are drifting in toward Ed, who nods at the telephone and 
               then cradles it. He stares down at the business card he holds.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...owing two month's rent. How could 
                         I have been so stupid. Handing over 
                         $10,000. For a piece of paper. And 
                         the man gone... like a ghost...

               PULLING BACK FROM ED

               In a different living room. He sits on a sofa, hands clasped 
               behind his head, listening. For the first time, as the voice-
               over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano 
               music.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...disappeared into thin air, 
                         vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki. 
                         Gone now. All gone. The money gone. 
                         Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could 
                         I have been so stupid?

               The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby 
               chair, also listening as Birdy plays.

               Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids 
               droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion 
               his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, 
               and he starts lightly to snore.

               BARBERSHOP

               The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at 
               the cut. Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs, 
               administering haircuts.

               The customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do 
               not hide rolls of fat. He has a hot towel over his face that 
               does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some 
               extent:

                                     CUSTOMER
                         She makes this stuff, she calls it 
                         gatto, it's got egg in there, it's 
                         got sugar, it's got--it's cake, 
                         basically, except she calls it gatto. 
                         Like if you don't call it cake maybe 
                         you won't put on any weight, like I 
                         need to eat gatto, you know what I'm 
                         saying? This stuff, if I've had a 
                         square meal, I've had my steak and 
                         potatoes, I can just have another 
                         cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask 
                         for the desert if it's not there...

               His voice turns into a drone under the narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Sooner or later everyone needs a

                         We were working for the bank now. We 
                         kept cutting the hair, trying to 
                         stay afloat, make the payments, tread 
                         water, day by day, day by day...

               CRANE DOWN

               Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, 
               the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff 
               reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy 
               Riedenschneider.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Most people think someone's accused 
                         of a crime, they haul 'em in and 
                         bring 'em to trial, but it's not 
                         like that, it's not that fast. The 
                         wheels of justice turn slow...

                                     BAILIFF
                         ...did willfully and with malice 
                         aforethought take the life of one 
                         David Allen Brewster, a human being...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         They have an arraignment, and then 
                         the indictment, and they entertain 
                         motions to dismiss, and postpone, 
                         and change the venue, and alter this 
                         and that and the other. They empanel 
                         a jury, which brings more motions, 
                         and they set a trial date and then 
                         change the date, and then often as 
                         not they'll change it again.

                                     BAILIFF
                         What say you to these charges?

               Our boom down has ended close on Doris. We hear Freddy 
               Riedenschneider, off:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         We plead not guilty, your honor.

               BARBERSHOP

               Booming down toward the fat man.

                         And through all of it we cut the 
                         hair.

               OPERA SINGERS

               We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in 
               character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, 
               dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths 
               of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. We 
               pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, 
               floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a 
               mask over his eyes, slumbers.

               RESTAURANT

               Tracking in toward Freddy Riedenschneider, who sits twirling 
               spaghetti with a fork against a spoon.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and shoveled it in at DaVinci's.

               LATERAL TRACK

               From inside a car. Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. Among 
               them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to 
               the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He'd brought in a private investigator 
                         from Sacramento...

               LATERAL TRACK

               Moving the opposite way. A different day, but again a crowd 
               moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man 
               scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his 
               hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring 
               his face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...to nose around into Big Dave's 
                         past.

               PUSHING IN TO ED

               In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy 
               at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I found myself more and more going 
                         over to the Abundas's. It was a 
                         routine we fell into, most every 
                         evening. I even went when Walter was 
                         away on his research trips. He was a 
                         genealogist, had traced back his 
                         side of the family seven generations, 
                         his late wife's, eight. It seemed 
                         like a screwy hobby. But then maybe 
                         all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found 
                         something there, in the old county 
                         courthouses, hospital file rooms, 
                         city archives, property rolls, 
                         registries, something maybe like 
                         what I found listening to Birdy play. 
                         Some kind of escape. Some kind of 
                         peace...

               The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but 
               then is snapped by a sharp clang.

               PRISON DOOR SWINGS OPEN

               We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room. 
               None of its three occupants is moving.

               The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table; the 
               private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped 
               back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his 
               fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between 
               his teeth; and Freddy Riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped 
               behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the 
               shaft of light that slants through the high window.

               A warder shuts the door behind Ed.

               Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance; 
               Riedenschneider does not.

               Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris, clasps his hands on 
               top of hers.

                                     ED
                         'Lo, honey.

               She looks at his hands on top of hers.

               A long beat.

               Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy 
               Riedenschneider announces:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...They got this guy, in Germany. 
                         Fritz something-or-other. Or is it. 
                         Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got 
                         this theory, you wanna test something, 
                         you know, scientifically--how the 
                         planets  go round the sun, what 
                         sunspots are made of, why the water 
                         comes out of the tap--well, you gotta 
                         look at it. But sometimes, you look 
                         at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya 
                         can't know the reality of what 
                         happened, or what *would've* happened 
                         if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn 
                         schnozz. So there *is* no 'what 
                         happened.' Not in any sense that we 
                         can grasp with our puny minds. Because 
                         our minds... out minds get in the 
                         way. Looking at something changes 
                         it. They call it the 'Uncertainty 
                         Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, 
                         but even Einstein says the guy's on 
                         to something.

               His gaze up at the window breaks. He strolls around the room, 
               still smiling.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Science. Perception. Reality. 
                         Doubt...

               He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin', 
                         sometimes, the more you look, the 
                         less you really know. It's a fact. A 
                         proved fact. In a way, it's the only 
                         fact there is. This heinie even wrote 
                         it out in numbers.

               He looks up at the private detective.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Burns?

               With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that its 
               front legs slap down onto the floor. He fishes a small 
               notebook from an inside pocket.

               His boredom is profound; his only concession to performance 
               is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the 
               other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.

                                     BURNS

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Yeah, yeah, couple of fistfights. Go 
                         to his service record.

               Burns looks at him sourly. He flips a couple of pages.

                                     BURNS
                         ...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned

                         capacity in US naval shipyards in

                         he's been clean.

               Riedenschneider nods, smiling.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Thank you, Burns, get lost.

               Burns pockets his notebook, adjusts his hat, jams his hands 
               into his pockets, and ambles out of the room.

               The slam of the door leaves quiet.

               At length:

                                     ED
                         ...So?

               Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         So? *So?!* This could be your dolly's 
                         ticket out of the deathhouse, so!

               Ed and Doris look at each other.

                                     ED
                         ...I don't get it.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Look, chum, this is a guy, from what 
                         I understand, told everybody he was 
                         a war hero, right? Island hopping, 
                         practically liberated the Pacific 
                         all by himself with a knife in one 
                         hand and a gun in the other and twenty 
                         yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         And now it turns out this dope spent 
                         the war sitting on his ass in some 
                         boatyard in San Diego. You asked for 
                         blackmail, let me give you blackmail: 
                         Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to 
                         open his own business here, has been 
                         lying to everybody in this town for 
                         the last four years, probably 
                         including half the people sitting on 
                         that jury. Well, it finally caught 
                         up with him--these dopes, it always 
                         does; someone threatened to spill 
                         it. Somebody knew his dirty little 
                         secret, just like your wife says. 
                         They called, they demanded money...

               He is looking at Doris.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Did Big Dave mention that it was 
                         something about his war service? I 
                         don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* 
                         have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, 
                         maybe he didn't; I'm not putting 
                         words in your mouth; the point is 
                         that this liar, this cynical 
                         manipulator, this man who through 
                         his lies sneered and belittled the 
                         sacrifice and heroism of all our 
                         boys who *did* serve and bleed and 
                         puke and die on foreign shores, and 
                         who made a fool out of this entire 
                         town, turns to *you* to help him out 
                         of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!

                                     ED
                         So... who... who actually--

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But 
                         the point is that if Mr Prosecutor 
                         over there had devoted half the time 
                         he's spent persecuting *this* woman 
                         to even the most cursory investigation 
                         of this schmoe's past, then we might 
                         *know* who! But we can't *know* what 
                         really happened! Because of Fritz, 
                         or Werner, or whatever the hell his 
                         name is! And because Me Prosecutor 
                         is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch 
                         who decided it's easier to victimize 
                         your wife! Because it's easier *not* 
                         to look! Because the more you look, 
                         the less you know! But the beauty of 
                         it is, we don't *gotta* know! We 
                         just gotta show that, goddamnit, 
                         *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. 
                         Science. The atom. *You* explain it 
                         to me. Go ahead. Try.

               He chuckles as he heads for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees 
                         daylight. We got a real shot at this, 
                         folks. Let's not get cocky.

               The door shuts behind him.

               Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.

               A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her 
               mouth.

                                     ED
                         Honey...?

               The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. 
               Ed frowns.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey?

               Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides 
               and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes 
               her head:

                                     DORIS
                         What a dope.

               ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM

               Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, 
               her eyes on the sheet music:

                                     BIRDY
                         He was deaf when he wrote this.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     BIRDY
                         Beethoven. He created it, and yet he 
                         never actually heard it. I suppose 
                         he heard it all in his head, somehow.

               Over her continued playing:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         So maybe Riedenschneider could get 
                         Doris off. Maybe it would all work 
                         out. And I thought--I hoped--that 
                         maybe there was a way out for me as 
                         well...

               A SIGN

               The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL / 
               PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949, 
               8:00 P.M.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The girl had talent, anyone could 
                         see that. And *she* wasn't some fly-
                         by-nighter, she was just a good clean 
                         kid...

               SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

               A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift 
               stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the 
               baby grand that has been set out center stage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...If she was going to have a career 
                         she'd need a responsible adult looking 
                         out for her...

               We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set 
               out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, 
               many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest 
               on Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...some kind of... manager. She'd 
                         have contracts to look at, be going 
                         on tours, playing on the radio maybe. 
                         I could help her sort through all of 
                         that, without charging her an arm 
                         and a leg, just enough to get by...

               Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience.

               EXT. SCHOOL

               Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm 
               summer night. He looks around the parking lot.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I could afford to charge less 
                         than the usual manager, not having 
                         to put up a big front like a lot of 
                         these phonies. And I could be with 
                         her, enough to keep myself feeling 
                         OK...

               A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, 
               laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another 
               student--a boy.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Why couldn't that work?... Why 
                         not?...

               Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's 
               drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hi, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy. I thought that was 
                         very good.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, in there? I messed up a little 
                         bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody 
                         noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is 
                         Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr 
                         Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Tony.

                                     TONY
                         Hello, sir.

               Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the 
               conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears 
               his throat.

                                     ED
                         ...Well, congratulations. I guess 
                         I'll be getting home.

                                     TONY
                         Nice to meet you, sir.

               TURANDOT SUITE

               It is morning. We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the 
               bathroom, where we hear water running.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking 
                         about in the days leading up to the 
                         trial. It seemed like once that was 
                         over, I'd be ready for a new start. 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider was very 
                         optimistic. He was busy preparing...

               We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider 
               hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water. 
               He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some 
               tonic in his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And finally it came... the first 
                         day of the trial...

               Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...What Riedenschneider called the 
                         Big Show.

               He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist.

               COURTROOM

               We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair. 
               He is sitting at the defense table.

               There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to 
               order.

                                     FRANK
                         Where's the judge? How come there's 
                         no judge?

               Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row 
               directly behind Riedenschneider.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Where's the judge, Ed?

               Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How come the judge doesn't come 
                         out?

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         The judge comes in last. He'll come 
                         in when Doris gets here.

                                     FRANK
                         So where's Doris? I thought we started 
                         at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's 
                         Doris?

               Riedenschneider is curt:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         She's late.

                                     FRANK
                         Late? How can she be late?

               Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* 
                         are in prison, and yet we're not 
                         late. We're on time, Ed. How can 
                         Doris be late? What, they don't have 
                         wake-up calls?

               The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's 
               bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters.

               The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down 
               and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his 
               desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider 
               and the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Counselors.

               Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his 
               counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leaning 
               forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible 
               from the gallery.

               The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones. 
               Frank leans in toward Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         What's going on, Ed? I thought there 
                         would be arguments. The bailiff, and 
                         so forth...

               Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly 
               stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider 
               looks back over his shoulder at Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed, what is this? Is this 
                         procedure?

               The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their 
               respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man 
               standing to one side.

                                     JUDGE
                         Bailiff.

               As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks 
               down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various 
               papers.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't understand... We had a real 
                         shot at it... We could have won this 
                         thing...

               The Bailiff Announces:

                                     BAILIFF
                         In the matter of the State of 
                         California versus Doris Crane, Case 
                         Number 87249 assigned to this Superior 
                         Court...

               As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It doesn't make any sense...

               BARBERSHOP

               Late afternoon sun slants in.

               The shop, not open for business, is very still. Ed, in his 
               courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line 
               the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees.

               Frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber 
               chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She'd hanged herself. I'd brought 
                         her a dress to wear to court and 
                         she'd used the belt. I didn't 
                         understand it either. At first I 
                         thought maybe it had something to do 
                         with me, that she'd figured out 
                         somehow how I fit into it and couldn't 
                         stand it, couldn't stand knowing...

               BEDROOM

               Night. Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That wasn't it, I would find out 
                         later. For now, everything just seemed 
                         ruined...

               METROPOLE LOBBY

               Riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind 
               him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back 
                         to Sacramento still shaking his head, 
                         saying it was the biggest 
                         disappointment of his professional 
                         career...

               FRANK'S HOUSE

               Day. Frank's kitchen.

               Frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown 
               over his pyjamas, unshaven.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect 
                         he was drinking; anyway, he stopped 
                         coming to work...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed, in his smock, works on a customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That left me to keep the place 
                         going, or the bank would've taken 
                         it.

               As he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between 
               his lips. He squints against the smoke drifting past his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...*I* was the principal barber now. 
                         I hired a new man for the second 
                         chair...

               Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a 
               gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I'd hired the guy who did the 
                         least gabbing when he came in for an 
                         interview. But I guess the new man 
                         had only kept quiet because he was 
                         nervous; once he had the job, he 
                         talked from the minute I opened the 
                         shop in the morning...

               EXT. BARBERSHOP

               It is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him 
               on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating 
               to illustrate his store.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until I locked up at night. For 
                         all I know, he talked to himself on 
                         the way home.

               STREET

               Ed walks along the sidewalk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...When *I* walked home, it seemed 
                         like everyone avoided looking at 
                         me...

               Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; their 
               averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...as if I'd caught some disease. 
                         This thing with Doris, nobody wanted 
                         to talk about it; it was like I was 
                         a ghost walking down the street...

               HOUSE

               As Ed lets himself in.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And when I got home now, the place 
                         felt empty.

               He sits on the couch and, after a beat, takes a cigarette 
               pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sat in the house, but there was 
                         nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't 
                         see anyone; no one saw me...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed is in his smock again, operating the clippers.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was the barber.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               The drone of the clippers has continued over the black. A 
               voice fades up:

                                     VOICE 1
                         So two blocks later I look at the 
                         change she gave me and, golly, I'm 
                         two bits short.

                                     VOICE 2
                         Two bits short.

                                     VOICE 1
                         So I walk back over to Linton's, 
                         find this gal--big argument; she 
                         doesn't even recall the transaction.

                                     VOICE 2
                         No recollection.

                                     VOICE 1
                         Doesn't recall the transaction, no 
                         recollection, so I said, Look, dear...

               FADE IN

               We are looking at a magazine story. Its headline, over an 
               illustration of a cresting wave, is: WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

               Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment 
               and racks of clothing on motorized tracks. Subheadlines read: 
               NEXT TO GODLINESS - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The 
               Thoroughly Modern Way To Clean.

               Ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs, staring at Life magazine. 
               The offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on 
               a customer.

                                     NEW MAN
                         ...go ahead, look at the menu, if 
                         you're in before six o'clock it's 
                         the, whatchamacallit, the--

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Early Bird Special.

                                     NEW MAN
                         What? Yeah, the Early Riser...

               Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph 
               of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in 
               the sky. The caption underneath: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.

                                     VOICE
                         Crane?

               Ed looks up.

               A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question 
               at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentarily 
               slackjawed.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm Crane.

                                     MAN
                         My name is Diedrickson. County medical 
                         examiner.

                                     ED
                         Yeah?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Just came for an informal chat...

               Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Why don't I buy you a drink?

               Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock, 
               addresses the new man, who still gapes.

                                     ED
                         Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?

                                     DWIGHT
                         Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your 
                         time.

               BAR

               It is late afternoon, dusty and empty.

               Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking 
               his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position.

               As the bartender approaches:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Rye.

                                     ED
                         Just coffee.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         You sure you don't want something 
                         stiffer?

               Ed shrugs and shakes his head.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Coffee it is.

               He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop 
               and stares at them. After a beat:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...County M. E. does an autopsy on 
                         anyone who dies in custody. I don't 
                         know if you knew that. It's routine.

               Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at 
               his hands, plows on:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Doesn't become a matter of public 
                         record unless there's foul play. 
                         However. I don't believe I'm 
                         *prohibited* from telling you this. 
                         I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, 
                         either. I don't exactly know.  But 
                         if *I* were the man, I'd want to be 
                         told.

                                     ED
                         Told what?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         I, uh... thanks.

               The bartender has set down the drinks.

               Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his 
               glass. Finally:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry to add to your burden, 
                         Crane, but I'd want to know it it 
                         was me. Your wife was pregnant. First 
                         trimester.

               A pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Well, there it is.

               Another pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry.

               He mutters to himself:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Hell, I hope I've done the right 
                         thing.

                                     ED
                         My wife and I had not... performed 
                         the sex act in many years.

               Diedrickson stiffens.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                              (murmuring)
                         ...Jesus.
                              (aloud)
                         ...Well, that's not really my 
                         business.

               He is hastily digging for money.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.

               He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he 
               leaves:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Good luck, Crane.

               His retreating footsteps echo down the bar.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the 
               middle background, knocking on a door.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I had never really talked 
                         much. I don't think that's a bad 
                         thing, necessarily. But it was funny: 
                         now I wanted to talk--now, with 
                         everyone gone. I was alone, with 
                         secrets I didn't want and no one to 
                         tell them to anyway.

               The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.

               APARTMENT

               We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It 
               is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests 
               too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas 
               are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the 
               one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its 
               feeble light.

               Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across 
               from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of 
               the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration 
               as she mumbles.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I visited a woman who was supposed 
                         to have powers in communicating with 
                         those who had passed across, as she 
                         called it. She said that people who 
                         passed across were picky about who 
                         they'd communicate with, not like 
                         most people you run into on this 
                         side...

               The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Giff me your hant.

               Ed places his hand in the center of the table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so you needed a guide who they 
                         didn't mind talking to, someone with 
                         a gift for talking to souls...

               Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it 
               rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, first she told me that my 
                         wife was in a peaceful place, that 
                         our souls were still connected by 
                         some spiritual bond, that she had 
                         never stopped loving me even though 
                         she'd done some things she wasn't 
                         proud of...

               Ed looks up at the old woman.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She was reading me like a book.

               She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then she started talking about 
                         'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that 
                         and was there anything I wanted to 
                         tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just 
                         be telling it to the old bat. And 
                         even if somehow Doris could hear, it 
                         wouldn't be on account of this so-
                         called medium.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               Ed is leaving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She was a phony. Just another gabber.

               EXT. TENEMENT

               Ed emerges from the building.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, 
                         Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my 
                         back on the old lady, on the veils, 
                         on the ghosts, on the dead, before 
                         they all sucked me in...

               Ed disappears into the night.

               ABUNDAS HOUSE

               It is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter 
               Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the 
               side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is 
               murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, 
               glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand.

               Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets 
               the phone down and comes to the door.

                                     WALTER
                         Ed, how're you holding up?

                                     ED
                         I'm OK, Walter, thanks.

               Walter opens the door to him.

                                     WALTER
                         I'm so damn sorry about your loss. 
                         Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     WALTER
                         Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long 
                         distance here.

                                     ED
                         Sure, Walter. Thanks.

               PARLOR

               Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: 
               homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hello, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy.

                                     BIRDY
                         We haven't seen you since... I'm 
                         terribly sorry.

               Ed sits across from her.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     BIRDY
                         We've certainly missed you.

                                     ED
                         Birdy, I've been doing a lot of 
                         thinking. There are a lot of things 
                         that haven't worked out for me. Life 
                         has dealt me some bum cards...

               He is loading a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...or maybe I just haven't played 
                         'em right, I don't know. But you're--

                                     BIRDY
                         Pop doesn't like people smoking in 
                         here.

               Ed stares. This takes a moment to register.

                                     ED
                         Oh. Sorry.

               Birdy lowers her voice:

                                     BIRDY
                         Sometimes I have a cigarette in here 
                         when he's away. Never when he's in 
                         the house. He can smell it a mile 
                         off.

               Ed is pocketing the cigarette.

                                     ED
                         Sure... Sure, it's his house.

                                     BIRDY
                         That's what he keeps telling me.

               Ed smiles thinly.

                                     ED
                         Anyway, uh... my point is you're 
                         young. A kid really, your whole life 
                         ahead of you. But it's not too soon 
                         to start thinking... to start making 
                         opportunities for yourself. Before 
                         it all washes away.

                                     BIRDY
                         Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so 
                         too. I work pretty hard at school.

                                     ED
                         That's swell. However, the music, if 
                         you want to pursue it, well, the 
                         lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only 
                         take you so far. There's this guy in 
                         San Francisco, I've made inquiries, 
                         everybody says he's the best. Trained 
                         lots of people who've gone on to 
                         have big concert careers, symphony 
                         orchestras, the works. His name is 
                         Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure 
                         I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, 
                         he's a Frenchman.

                                     BIRDY
                         Boy.

                                     ED
                         You've got talent, anyone could see 
                         that. And he's the best. If he thinks 
                         a student has talent, he'll take 'em 
                         on for next to nothing. You're a 
                         cinch to be accepted, I could cover 
                         the cost of the lessons, like I said, 
                         it's pretty modest--

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, Mr Crane--

                                     ED
                         I have to do it. I can't stand by 
                         and watch more things go down the 
                         drain. You're young, you don't 
                         understand.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't 
                         really thought about a career or 
                         stuff.

                                     ED
                         I know you haven't. Look, just go 
                         meet him as a favor to me. I talked 
                         to this guy. Hope I pronounced his 
                         name right. He sounded very busy, 
                         but he's not a bad egg; he loosened 
                         up a little when I told him how 
                         talented you are. He agreed to see 
                         you this Saturday. He said maybe you 
                         were a diamond in the rough. His 
                         words.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Just see him, as a favor to me.

               STUDIO WAITING ROOM

               It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set 
               against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads 
               to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a 
               fast and difficult piece of music.

               Ed sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters 
               of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons.

               Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow 
               tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a 
               Junior Contour.

               Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch.

               The piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices. 
               Dull footsteps.

               The studio door swings open.

               A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette 
               ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a 
               knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and 
               settle on Ed.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...You are ze fahzer?

                                     ED
                         No. Uh... family friend.

                                     MAN
                         I am Carcanogues.

               He smiles at Birdy.

                                     MAN
                         ...You wait, my dear?

                                     BIRDY
                         Sure, Mr K.

               A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.

               STUDIO

               Ed enters, uncomfortable. He looks around, taking in the 
               high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano.

               Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         I speak to you on ze phone, non? You 
                         have a special interest in music?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah yes, a music lover.

                                     ED
                         Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah.

               He uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm, 
               tosses them back and washes them down.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Ah-hah.

               He twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his 
               mouth and lights it.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Mm.

                                     ED
                         Well? How'd she do?

               This elicits a Gallic frown of consideration.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ze girl?... She seems like a very 
                         nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, 
                         like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very 
                         nice girl. However, ztinks.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Is not so hard to understand. Her 
                         playing, very polite.

                                     ED
                         Did she make mistakes?

               Another gallic moue:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she 
                         plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the 
                         right note, always. Very proper.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand, no mistakes, 
                         she's just a kid--I thought you taught 
                         the, uh, the--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah, but that is just what I cannot 
                         teach. I cannot teach her to have a 
                         soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, 
                         is not about the fingers. *Done* 
                         with the fingers, yes. But the music, 
                         she is inside. Inside, monsieur...

               A two-handed gesture, indicating his heart.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...The music start here...

               He waggles his fingers:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...come out through here; then, 
                         maybe...

               His wave takes in the heavens:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...she can go up there.

                                     ED
                         Well, look, I don't claim to be an 
                         expert--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Then you listen to me, for I am 
                         expert. That girl, she give me a 
                         headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. 
                         Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, 
                         I think, maybe, she make a very good 
                         typist.

               DRIVING

               We are driving through the rural countryside of northern 
               California. It is a two-lane road with little traffic. Sun 
               strobes the car through the passing trees.

               Ed drives, glaring. Birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed, 
               ever cheerful.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I stank, didn't I?

                                     ED
                         He didn't say that.

                                     BIRDY
                         But more or less.

                                     ED
                         Look, I'm no expert, but--

                                     BIRDY
                         It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         I'm sure there's a dozen teachers 
                         better than this clown. More 
                         qualified. Goddamn phony.

                                     BIRDY
                         But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm 
                         not interested in playing music 
                         professionally.

               Ed looks at her.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I'm not certain I'll have a career 
                         at all, and if I do, I'll probably 
                         be a veterinarian.

                                     ED
                         ...Uh-huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         I do appreciate the interest you've 
                         taken, though.

                                     ED
                         Ah... it's nothing.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm only sorry that I didn't play 
                         better for you. I know it would've 
                         made you happy. You know what you 
                         are?

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         You're an enthusiast.

                                     ED
                         Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

               He loads a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...I guess I've been all wet.

                                     BIRDY
                         But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

               She reaches over to touch his thigh.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I wanted to make you happy.

                                     ED
                         Birdy--

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK...

               She is leaning over his lap.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I want to do it, Mr Crane.

               Ed is shocked:

                                     ED
                         Birdy!

               He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting 
               to be violent.

                                     ED
                         ...No, please.

                                     BIRDY
                         Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--

               The blare of an oncoming horn.

               Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on 
               the wheel.

               The oncoming car.

               Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams.

               CRASH: the car hits a roadside tree.

               BLACK.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Time slows down right before an 
                         accident, and I had time to think 
                         about things. I thought about what 
                         an undertaker had told me once--that 
                         your hair keeps growing, for a while 
                         anyway, after you die...

               A hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then 
               off the road, down an embankment.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and then it stops. I thought, 
                         what keeps it growing? Is it like a 
                         plant in soil? What goes out of the 
                         soil? The soul? And when does the 
                         hair realize that it's gone?

               We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head 
               resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom 
               down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we move 
               we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.

               The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright 
               revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it 
               disappears, leaving only black.

               FADE IN

               Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a 
               cigarette in the late afternoon light.

               A dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children 
               are playing somewhere up the street.

               Ed looks down at his watch. It is 5:30.

               Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway 
               stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat. He is a small 
               figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway.

               After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the 
               house, and jots something down.

               He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and 
               is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is 
               being watched. His manner instantly warms.

                                     MAN
                         Hello!

                                     ED
                         Hello.

               The man starts up the walk.

                                     MAN
                         I notice you still have peastone in 
                         your driveway.

               Yeah.

                                     MAN
                         Well, of course, you don't have to 
                         rejuvenate that once every couple of 
                         years, don't you, when the peastone 
                         thins out.

               Ed shrugs.

                                     MAN
                         ...Where does it go, huh? Like the 
                         odd sock. But you *know* where it 
                         goes--you probably pick pieces of it 
                         off your lawn all the time, churn it 
                         up with your lawn mower, sweep it 
                         off the walk here--pain in the neck.

               Ed shrugs again.

                                     ED
                         Doesn't bother me.

                                     MAN
                         Well, have you ever considered tar 
                         Macadam? People think it's just for 
                         public works and commercial purposes, 
                         roads, parking lots, so forth...

               A car pulls into the drive.

                                     MAN
                         ...but we have the technology now to 
                         bring it to the homeowner, the 
                         individual consumer, at a very 
                         reasonable price.

               Doris emerges from the car.

                                     MAN
                         ...Mind if I show you the 
                         specifications?--Evening, ma'am.

               Doris gives him a hard look.

                                     DORIS
                         What're *you* selling?

               The man gives a practiced laugh.

                                     MAN
                         Well, ma'am, I was just telling your 
                         husband here about tar Macadam, for 
                         your home driveway here--these are 
                         the specs...

               Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.

                                     MAN
                         ...It's the modern way to--

               Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.

                                     DORIS
                         Get lost.

               The man gazes at her. His smile fades fast and he and Doris 
               stare at each other, two hard cases.

               He turns stiffly and stalks off.

               Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well. She stalks up 
               the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front 
               door of the house, letting it slam behind her.

               Quiet, early evening.

               Ed sits, smoking.

               At length he rises and goes in to the house.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               It is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping 
               from the kitchen.

               Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around 
               a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set.

               With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the 
               couch.

               Ed sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray 
               closer on the coffee table.

               She sips. He puffs.

                                     ED
                         ...Doris--

                                     DORIS
                         Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

               The sit. The light is failing. The clink of ice cubes.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin. As 
               the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint, 
               distant:

                                     VOICE
                         Are you there? Are you awake?

               A blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolves 
               into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in 
               close.

               He leans away, murmuring:

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's coming around. Can you talk, 
                         sir? These men have to talk.

               Ed is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and one 
               side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life 
               support.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.

               Two police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in.

                                     PERSKY
                         Are you awake?... Is he awake?

                                     KREBS
                         Crane? We have to tell you, as soon 
                         as you're conscious--is he conscious?

                                     PERSKY
                         His eyes are open.

                                     KREBS
                         Uh... you're under arrest.

                                     PERSKY
                         As soon as the doctor lets us, we 
                         gotta move you. Does he understand 
                         that? We're supposed to tell him. 
                         Are you conscious?

                                     KREBS
                         You'll go to the prison hospital.

                                     PERSKY
                         Under arrest for murder.

               Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia:

                                     ED
                         Birdy... I didn't mean to--

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say?

                                     ED
                         Birdy...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. 
                         Broken clavicle.

               The doctor leans in.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...That's the collarbone, Crane. 
                         Broken. She's OK though.

                                     KREBS
                         So he understands? He's under arrest 
                         for murder?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave.

                                     PERSKY
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say? Does he understand?

                                     PERSKY
                         He said OK. Is that what he said?

               Krebs raises his voice:

                                     KREBS
                         You're under arrest for the murder 
                         of Creighton Tolliver! Do you 
                         understand?

               The voices are fading away:

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Does he understand?...

                                                                   FADE OUT

               UNDERWATER

               Light glimmers in water. We are drifting down, down, down.

               We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, waving 
               to keep himself submerged. It is a ten-year-old boy staring, 
               wide-eyed, at something in front of him. Bubbles 
               intermittently stream from his open mouth.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole 
                         outside of town had found his car...

               The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton 
               Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached at 
               only one corner, the rest of it waving free.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They'd winched it out...

               TRACKING

               We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated 
               men. The men rise.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and found he'd been beaten, just 
                         like Big Dave said--beaten to death...

               We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small 
               door behind his raised bench.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Inside the briefcase were the 
                         partnership papers I'd signed...

               The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on 
               the jury, now reseating itself.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...showing that I'd given him ten 
                         grand. For the district attorney...

               In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney 
               rises to read the charge. His voice plays distantly, muted, 
               the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...that made it fall into place: I'd 
                         gotten Doris to steal the money, the 
                         pansy had gotten wise somehow, and 
                         I'd had to kill him to cover my 
                         tracks. I was in a spot. I called in 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider...

               Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. As he 
               listens to the charge:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and signed the house over to him. 
                         He said he didn't ordinarily work 
                         that cheap, but he figured he owed 
                         me something since the last one hadn't 
                         played out...

               The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing 
               voice drops into the hole:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Not guilty, your honor...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I tried to tell him the whole story, 
                         but Riedenschneider stopped me. He 
                         said the story made his head hurt, 
                         and anyway he didn't see any way of 
                         using it without putting me on the 
                         hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

               Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he 
               sits next to him. Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one 
               leg.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told me not to worry, though, 
                         said he'd think of something, Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.

               JAIL

               We are tracking in on Ed, lying on the bunk in his cell.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They put me on twenty-four-hour 
                         deathwatch...

               A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked 
               chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice 
                         like they said my wife had done...

               COURTROOM

               The district attorney is rising again, this time to address 
               the jury.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But in front of the jury they had 
                         it that Doris was a saint; the whole 
                         plan had been mine, I was a Svengali 
                         who'd forced Doris to join my criminal 
                         enterprise...

               The district attorney is pointing at Ed.

                                     DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                         ...cynically used his own wife as a 
                         cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical 
                         cunning...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         On and on it went, how I'd used Doris 
                         and then let her take the fall. That 
                         stuff smarted because some of it was 
                         close to being true...

               The district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn to 
               Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of 
               him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking 
               inspiration for his own.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then it was Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider's turn.

               Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed 
                         a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked 
                         about how I'd lost my place in the 
                         universe...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...a puny player on the great world's 
                         stage...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...how I was too ordinary to be the 
                         criminal mastermind the D.A. made me 
                         out to be, how there was some greater 
                         scheme at work that the state had 
                         yet to unravel, and he threw in some 
                         of the old truth stuff he hadn't had 
                         a chance to trot out for Doris...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...who among us is in a position to 
                         say...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told them to look at me--look 
                         at me close. That the closer they 
                         looked the less sense it would all 
                         make, that I wasn't the kind of guy 
                         to kill a guy, that I was the barber, 
                         for Christ's sake...

               We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was just like them, an ordinary 
                         man, guilty of living in a world 
                         that had no place for me, guilty of 
                         wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, 
                         but not of murder...

               Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground 
               to point a finger directly at Ed's face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and 
                         if they voted to convict me, well, 
                         they'd be practically cinching the 
                         noose around their own necks. He 
                         told them to look not at the facts 
                         but at the meaning of the facts, and 
                         then he said the facts *had* no 
                         meaning. It was a pretty good speech, 
                         and even had me going...

               A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until Frankie interrupted it.

               Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor.

               A bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over 
               Ed, bellowing through tears:

                                     FRANK
                         What kind of man *are* you? What 
                         kind of man *are* you?

               Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's, 
               loudly protesting:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Move for a mistrial, your honor! 
                         Move for a mistrial! This outrageous 
                         display cannot help but prejudice...

               Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong 
               glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the 
               floor.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...and inflame the passions of these 
                         twelve fine men and women...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, he got his mistrial, but 
                         the well had run dry. There was 
                         nothing left to mortgage; 
                         Riedenschneider went home and the 
                         court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

               Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman 
               who enters the plea in the new trial:

                                     GARROWAY
                         Your honor, we plead guilty, with 
                         extenuating circumstances.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...who threw me on the mercy of the 
                         court. It was my only chance, he 
                         said. I guess that meant I never had 
                         a chance...

               The judge starts droning the sentence:

                                     JUDGE
                         ...a menace to society... a predator 
                         on his own wife, his business 
                         associates, on an innocent young 
                         girl... social contract... line 
                         crossed... the offender forfeits the 
                         right to his own life... I hereby 
                         order that you be taken to a place 
                         of confinement...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               We are tracking down the hall.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He wasn't buying any of that Modern 
                         Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, 
                         or any of the mercy stuff either. 
                         No, he was going by the book, and 
                         the book said I got the chair...

               Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, 
               hands clasped behind his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so here I am. At first I didn't 
                         know how I got here. I knew step by 
                         step of course, which is what I've 
                         told you, step by step; but I couldn't 
                         see any pattern...

               LATER

               Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now that I'm near the end, I'm 
                         glad that this men's magazine paid 
                         me to tell my story. Writing it has 
                         helped me sort it all out. They're 
                         paying five cents a word, so you'll 
                         pardon me if sometimes I've told you 
                         more than you wanted to know...

               Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister 
               publication Nugget lie on the little desk. Their lurid covers 
               depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and 
               AFTER TEN YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE, I DISCOVER I AM AN ESCAPED 
               LUNATIC.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But now, all the disconnected 
                         things seems to hook up.

               Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That's the funny thing about going 
                         away, knowing the date you're gonna 
                         die--and the men's magazine wanted 
                         me to tell how that felt...

               We hear a pulsing treble hum. Ed opens his eyes.

               The door to his cell is open.

               He rises and goes through the door.

               PRISON HALLWAY

               Ed, alone, walks down the hallway. The pulsing treble hum is 
               louder.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, it's like pulling away from 
                         the maze. While you're in the maze 
                         you go through willy-nilly, turning 
                         where you think you have to turn, 
                         banging into dead ends, one thing 
                         after another...

               PRISON YARD

               Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone 
               walls. A hard spotlight shines down from above. Ed squints 
               into it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But get some distance on it, and 
                         all those twists and turns, why, 
                         they're the shape of your life. It's 
                         hard to explain...

               The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer. We see its 
               revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of 
               its top bubble.

               After spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the 
               tremolo hum with it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But seeing it whole gives you 
                         some peace.

               Ed turns and re-enters the prison.

               ED'S CELL

               Ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind 
               his head. A hand enters to shake him awake.

               Three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing 
               a surplice and holding a bible.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The men's magazine also asked 
                         about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm 
                         sorry about the pain I caused other 
                         people...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               He is walking the last mile.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...but I don't regret anything. Not 
                         a thing. I used to. I used to regret 
                         being the barber.

               A door at the end opens:

               An electric chair. Straps open, and waiting:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I dont know where I'm being taken.

               Ed is placed in the chair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I don't know what waits for me, 
                         beyond the earth and sky. But I'm 
                         not afraid to go.

               A man stoops at his feet. He has a bucket of water and a 
               straight razor.

               He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch 
               of Ed's calf.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe the things I don't understand 
                         will be clearer there, like when a 
                         fog blows away...

               Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the 
               bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating 
               hairs.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe Doris will be there.

               They are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And maybe there I can tell her...

               The men withdraw.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...all those things...

               A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch. 
               As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...they don't have words for here.

               Black.

                         Yeah, I worked in a barbershop. But 
                         I never considered myself a barber...

               We track back from a barber's pole.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I stumbled into it--well, married 
                         into it more precisely...

               We track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening 
               door. The pull back and tilt down show the top of the head 
               of a customer entering in slow motion.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I wasn't my establishment. Like 
                         the fella says, I only work here...

               We track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, 
               aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The dump was 200 feet square, 
                         with five chairs, or stations as we 
                         call 'em, even though there were 
                         only two of us working...

               We track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across 
               a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one 
               hand. In slow motion, he laughs and chats.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frank Raffo, my brother-in-law, 
                         was the principal barber. And man, 
                         could he talk...

               Another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers 
               across a child's head. A cigarette between his lips.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now maybe if you're eleven or 
                         twelve years old, Frank's got an 
                         interesting point of view, but 
                         sometimes it got on my nerves. Not 
                         that I'd complain, mind you. Like I 
                         said, he was the principal barber.  
                         Frank's father August--they called 
                         him Guzzi--had worked the heads up 
                         in Santa Rosa for thirty-five years 
                         until his ticker stopped in the middle 
                         of a Junior Flat Top. He left the 
                         shop to Frankie free and clear. And 
                         that seemed to satisfy all of Frank's 
                         ambitions: cutting the hair and 
                         chewing the fat. Me, I don't talk 
                         much...

               He plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into 
               a tray.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I just cut the hair...

               LATE IN THE DAY

               The barbershop is empty of customers. Late sun slants in 
               through the front window. The two barbers--the narrator and 
               his brother-in-law--sit in two of the barber chairs, idly 
               reading magazines.

                                     FRANK
                         Says here that the Russians exploded 
                         n A-bomb and there's not a damn thing 
                         we can do about it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         How d'ya like them apples?

               Beat.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed?

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     FRANK
                         Russians exploded an A-bomb.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus...

                         Now, being a barber is a lot like 
                         being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's 
                         not much to it once you've learned 
                         the basic moves. For the kids there's 
                         the Butch, or the Heinie...

               We cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:

                         the Vanguard, the Junior Contour 
                         and, occasionally, the Executive 
                         Contour. Adults get variations on 
                         the same, along with the Duck Butt, 
                         the Timberline...

               Ed trims the fringe around a balding head.

                         ...and something we call the Alpine 
                         Rope Toss.

               He snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes 
               it across a bald pate.

                         ...I lived in a little bungalow on 
                         Napa Street. The place was OK, I 
                         guess; it had an electric ice box, 
                         gas hearth, and a garbage grinder 
                         build into the sink. You might say I 
                         had it made.

               We float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as 
               a black coupe pulls into the driveway.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Oh yeah. There was one other 
                         thing...

               We track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting 
               on a girdle.

                         ...Doris kept the books at 
                         Nirdlinger's, a small department 
                         store on Main Street. Unlike me, 
                         Doris liked the work, accounting; 
                         she liked knowing where everything 
                         stood. And she got a ten per cent 
                         employee discount on whatever she 
                         wanted--nylon stockings...

               Close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to 
               the garter.

               Close on an atomiser misting her bosom with Jungle Gardenia 
               by Tuvache.

               Doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee 
               table.

                         ...Doris's boss, Big Dave Brewster, 
                         was married to Ann Nirdlinger, the 
                         department store heiress. Tonight 
                         they were coming over for dinner--as 
                         Doris said, we were 'entertaining'...

               Ed sits on the living-room davenport in an uncomfortable 
               suit, smoking.

               The doorbell rings.

               THE DOOR

               Ed opens it to reveal a large man in a suit and his demure, 
               bird-like wife.

                                     DAVE
                         How ya doin', Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK. Take your coat, Ann?

               DINNER TABLE

               The two couples are in the middle of the meal.

                                     DAVE
                         Japs had us pinned down in Buna for 
                         something like six weeks. Well, I 
                         gotta tell ya, I thought *we* had it 
                         tough, but, Jesus, we had supply. 
                         *They* were eating grubs, nuts, 
                         thistles. When we finally up and 
                         bust off the beach we found Arnie 
                         Bragg, kid missing on recon; the 
                         Japs had *eaten* the sonofabitch, if 
                         you'll pardon the, uh... And this 
                         was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' 
                         to write home about. I mean, I never 
                         would've, ya know, so what do I say, 
                         honey? When I don't like dinner, 
                         what do I say?

               Ann smiles wanly.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I say, Jesus, honey, Arnie Bragg--
                         *again*?!

               He roars with laughter.

               Ed gives an acknowledging smile.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Arnie Bragg--*again*?!

               He dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Were you in the service, Ed?

                                     ED
                         No, Dave, I wasn't.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed was 4F on account of his fallen 
                         arches.

                                     DAVE
                         Mm, that's tough.

               FRONT PORCH

               Ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down. 
               Crickets chirp. From inside the house we hear laughter and 
               clattering dishes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Yeah... I guess Doris liked all 
                         that he-man stuff. Sometimes I had 
                         the feeling that she and Big Dave 
                         were a lot closer than they let on...

               He turns and looks through the screen door into the house.

               Across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly 
               lit kitchen. Big Dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the 
               counter drying dishes. His broad back heaves with laughter 
               while Doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing 
               dishes across.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The signs were all there plain 
                         enough--not that I was gonna prance 
                         about it, mind you. It's a free 
                         country.

               Footsteps approach the front porch.

               With the squeak of the screen door, Big Dave emerges.

                                     DAVE
                         Holding down the porch area?

               Ed gives a half-grin of wry acknowledgement. Big Dave relaxes, 
               forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front 
               lawn.

                                     DAVE
                         ...That's quite a wife you got there.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         She's a rare one.

                                     ED
                         How's business, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Couldn't be better. These're boom 
                         times in retailing. We're opening 
                         another store, Big Dave's Annex, 
                         there on Garson. This is strictly 
                         haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, 
                         ladies' foundations and undergarments. 
                         Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making 
                         Doris the comptroller. How're things 
                         at the, uh, the barbershop?

                                     ED
                         All right, I guess.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Fine. Fine. Well, you might want 
                         to drop by the Annex when we open, 
                         update your suit--'course, you're in 
                         the smock all day.

               He chuckles.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Say, where do you get those things 
                         anyway?

                                     DAVE
                         Uh-huh.

               There is a silence. At length, gazing out at the lawn, Big 
               Dave clears his throat.

               CHURCH

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I went to church once a 
                         week...

               We are tilting down a long stained-glass window depicting 
               the resurrection of Christ.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Usually Tuesday night...

               Faintly, we hear an amplified voice:

                                     CALLER
                         I... seven...

               Ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit 
               cigarette in his mouth.

                                     CALLER
                         ...Bee... Four...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris wasn't big on divine worship...

               Doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of 
               her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and I doubt if she believed in 
                         life everlasting; she'd most likely 
                         tell you that our reward is on this 
                         earth and bingo is probably the extent 
                         of it...

               Still focused on her cards, Doris mutters to Ed:

                                     DORIS
                         Watch your card, honey.

                                     CALLER
                         I... sixteen...

               Ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from 
               his cigarette.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I wasn't crazy about the game, but, 
                         I don't know, it made her happy, and 
                         I found the setting peaceful.

                                     CALLER
                         Gee... nine...

               Doris sucks in her breath.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus, bingo--BINGO!

               BARBERSHOP

               Sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. 
               Ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, 
               a cigarette dangling from his lip. Frank sits on one of the 
               vinyl waiting chairs, talking at Ed's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I 
                         mean, if you're really serious. You 
                         tie your own flies, you do a--I know 
                         it's matickless, I know, people say, 
                         hey, you can buy flies at the store--
                         but you can buy your fish at the 
                         store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         The point is there's a certain art 
                         to the process. The point is not 
                         merely to provide, and let me point 
                         out, these fish are not as dumb as 
                         you might think.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Sportsmanship! That's my point. June 
                         fly, Ed? Mosquito? Which of these? 
                         Well, what fish do you seek?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Sure, go to the store. Go there, 
                         describe to the man where you will 
                         be fishing, and for what, and the 
                         weather conditions, sun, no sun, 
                         whatnot, and so forth, and then you 
                         might as well have the man go ahead 
                         and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...

               We see a black-suited figure approaching through the windows 
               at the far end of the shop. He is almost blown out by the 
               late-day sunlight hitting the window.

                                     FRANK
                         ...My point is, this is a man who 
                         knows nothing no matter how much you 
                         tell him, so sell him the goddamn 
                         FISH, Ed.

               The bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle-
               aged man walks in. He is well dressed--perhaps a little too 
               snazzily for this small town--and has a sporty pencil 
               mustache.

                                     MAN
                         OK, boys, which of you gets the 
                         privilege?

                                     FRANK
                         We're just closing, friend.

                                     MAN
                         Oh, happy days! I wish I was doing 
                         well enough to turn away business! 
                         More power to ya, brother! The public 
                         be damned!

                                     FRANK
                         Hey, what's your problem, friend? 
                         This is a business establishment 
                         with posted hours--

               Ed cuts in with a jerk of the head.

                                     ED
                         I'll take care of him, go ahead, 
                         Frank. Have a seat, mister.

               Frank looks sourly at the stranger.

                                     FRANK
                         ...You sure, Eddie?

                                     ED
                         Yeah, yeah--go home.

               As Frank leaves:

                                     FRANK
                         In your ear, mister.

               The stranger chuckles.

                                     STRANGER
                         Oh, those fiery Mediterraneans. Say! 
                         Not so fast there, brother--

               Ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him 
               back; he lifts off a toupee.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Pretty good, huh? Fools even the 
                         experts. 100 percent human hair, 
                         handcrafted by Jacques of San 
                         Francisco, and I'd hate to have to 
                         tell you what I paid for it.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     STRANGER
                         Yes, it's a nice rug. I'm paying for 
                         it down on the installment plan...

               Ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...A lot of folks live with the pate 
                         exposed. They say the dames think 
                         it's sexy. But for my money it's 
                         just not good grooming--and grooming, 
                         my friend, is probably the most 
                         important thing in business--after 
                         personality, of course...

               He twists around to offer his hand.

                                     STRANGER
                         ...Creighton Tolliver, pleased to 
                         know ya.

                                     ED
                         Ed Crane. What brings you to Santa 
                         Rosa?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         A goose, friend. I was chasing a 
                         wild goose. Ed, have you ever heard 
                         of venture capital?

                                     ED
                         Uh--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, it's the wildest goose there 
                         is. Risk money. Very speculative. 
                         Except, Ed, in certain situations, 
                         it's not, see? I thought I had a 
                         prospect here. Well, I make the haul 
                         up and this lousy so-and-so tells me 
                         his situation has changed--all his 
                         capital's gonna be tied up in 
                         expansion plans of his own. Thank 
                         you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! 
                         It's only the biggest business 
                         opportunity since Henry Ford and I 
                         can't seem to interest a soul!

                                     ED
                         That right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         It's called dry cleaning. You heard 
                         me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'--
                         wash without water, no suds, no 
                         tumble, no stress on the clothes. 
                         It's all done with chemicals, friend, 
                         and your garments end up crisp and 
                         fresh. And here's the capper: no 
                         shrinkage.

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         That's right! Dry cleaning--remember 
                         the name. It's going to revolutionize 
                         the laundry industry, and those that 
                         get in early are gonna bear the fruit 
                         away. All I need is $10,000 to open 
                         my first store, then I use its cash 
                         flow to finance another, and so on--
                         leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole 
                         chain. Well, me and a partner. 
                         Cleanliness, friend. There's money 
                         in it. There's a future. There's 
                         room to grow... Say, that's looking 
                         pretty good. Let's see it with the 
                         hairpiece on...

               BATHROOM DOORWAY

               It is evening. Ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb 
               contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a 
               cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Dry cleaning...

               The reverse show Doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Was I crazy to be thinking about 
                         it? Was he a huckster, or opportunity, 
                         the real McCoy?

               Ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...My first instinct was, no, no, 
                         the whole idea was nuts. But maybe 
                         that was the instinct that kept me 
                         locked up in the barbershop, nose 
                         against the exit, afraid to try 
                         turning the knob. What if I could 
                         get the money?

                                     DORIS
                         Honey?

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               She lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.

                                     DORIS
                         Shave my legs, will ya?

               Ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette 
               back in his mouth to free his hands. He picks up a bar of 
               soap and starts soaping the leg.

               He sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor.

               The razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark 
               bits of hair flecking the white foam.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was clean. No water. Chemicals.

               He shakes the razor in the tub. Shavings float away across 
               the soap-slicked water.

                                     DORIS
                              (absently, as she 
                              reads)
                         Gimme a drag.

               Ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, 
               uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for Doris 
               as she sucks.

               He brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to 
               his own mouth. She murmurs:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Love ya, honey.

               A DOOR

               We hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into 
               laughter.

               A hand enters to knock.

                                     VOICE
                         Yeah, come in.

               The door swings open to show Creighton in his shirtsleeves 
               sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. A tray of room-
               service dishes sits near him.

               He is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (into the phone)
                         OK... yeah. I'll see you tomorrow.

               He hangs up, looks quizzically at Ed.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Oh, I thought you were the 
                         porter... Can I help you?

               Ed stands awkwardly by the door.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm, uh, Ed.

               The stranger's look does not show recognition.

                                     ED
                         ...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at 
                         a disadvantage.

                                     ED
                         I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Jesus! The barber! I'll be a 
                         sonofagun. Why didn't you say so? 
                         'Course--the barber.

               Ed nods, his smile faint and forced.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...I didn't recognize you without 
                         the smock. Did I--damn--did I leave 
                         something at the shop?

                                     ED
                         No. I might be interested in that, 
                         uh, business proposition--

               Creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and 
               arranges it on his head.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         You got the dough?!

                                     ED
                         I can get it, yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Come in, come in, siddown over there. 
                         Coffee?

                                     ED
                         No. I--tell me--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Sure.

                                     ED
                         What's involved, aside from putting 
                         up the money? What're you looking 
                         for the partner to do?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want 
                         to keep tabs on your investment, of 
                         course, but I'm looking for a silent 
                         partner. I've done the research, 
                         I've contacted the vendors, the deal 
                         is set. I'm just looking for venture 
                         capital, friend. Disappear if you 
                         want, check in whenever you like--I 
                         want the dough; I don't take 
                         attendance.

                                     ED
                         And how do we share--

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. 
                         You and me. Finance and expertise. 
                         So--you've got the dough then, do 
                         ya?

                                     ED
                         I'll have it in a week.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, I'll be damned. The barber! 
                         And I thought this trip was a bust. 
                         Well...

               He reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand 
               and hands Ed a glass.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...it just goes to show, when one 
                         door slams shut, another one opens. 
                         Here's to ya, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

               They both knock back the whiskey. Creighton leans back and 
               gives Ed a heavy-lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, 
               his hairpiece slightly askew.

               Ed stares back.

               After a beat, without taking his eyes of Ed, Creighton reaches 
               up and loosens his tie. An almost imperceptible wink.

               Ed stares.

                                     ED
                         ...Was that a pass?

                                     CREIGHTON
                              (hoarsely)
                         Maybe.

                                     ED
                         You're out of line, mister.

               Creighton throws up his hands apologetically.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         No problem!

                                     ED
                         Way out of line.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Right! Strictly business.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

               CLOSE ON TYPEWRITTEN NOTE

               It says:

               I KNOW ABOUT YOU AND DORIS CRANE.  COOPERATE OR ED CRANE 
               WILL KNOW.  YOUR WIFE WILL KNOW. EVERYONE WILL KNOW. GATHER 
               $10,000 AND AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.

               A hand pulls the note out of a typewriter carriage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I sent it to Dave the next morning. 
                         And I waited.

               BARBERSHOP

               We are looking down at the top of an eight-year-old's crew 
               cut as clippers buzz its perimeter.

               Frank reads a magazine. The youngster reads a comic as Ed 
               works his head.

                                     ED
                         Frank.

                                     FRANK
                         Huh?

                                     ED
                         This hair.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah.

                                     ED
                         ...You ever wonder about it?

                                     FRANK
                         Whuddya mean?

                                     ED
                         I don't know... How it keeps on 
                         coming. It just keeps growing.

                                     FRANK
                         Yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?

                                     ED
                         No, I mean it's growing, it's part 
                         of us. And we cut it off. And throw 
                         it away.

                                     FRANK
                         Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare 
                         the kid.

               Ed shuts off the clippers and give the apron a flap.

                                     ED
                         OK, bud, you're through.

               The kid hops down, still reading his comic, and ambles out 
               the door. Ed gives Frank a considering stare.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm gonna take his hair and throw 
                         it out in the dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the--

                                     ED
                         I'm gonna mingle it with common house 
                         dirt.

                                     FRANK
                         What the hell are you talking about?

               Ed turns back to the counter to hang up his clippers.

                                     ED
                         I don't know. Skip it.

               EXT. ED'S HOUSE

               It is twilight. Ed lifts the latch on the front gate and, 
               cigarette in his mouth, heads up the walk.

               Music filters out from the house.

               INT. ED'S HOUSE

               Ed walks though the living room, hands in his pockets. The 
               music emanates from a radio in the bedroom.

                                     DORIS
                         Ed?

               A track forward reveals Doris sitting at a vanity, doing her 
               hair. Her dress is half zipped at the back.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Gimme a zip.

               Ed walks over behind her.

                                     ED
                         Where you going?

                                     DORIS
                         Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I 
                         told you last week, for the Christmas 
                         Push.

                                     ED
                         Yeah, right.

               We are close on the zipper as Ed's hand takes the tab, pauses, 
               the lowers it slightly. Her back blooms through the dark 
               fabric of the dress.

               He slides the zipper up, and Doris reaches for a perfume 
               atomizer.

                                     DORIS
                         Come on, get ready. It's important.

                                     ED
                         Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.

                                     DORIS
                         Oh, don't be a grump.

               SALES FLOOR

               It is festooned with streamers.

               Ed leans against a wall, one hand dug into a pocket, the 
               other bringing a cigarette to his lips.

               Band music plays and Nirdlinger's employees whirl on the 
               dance floor. Bobby-soxed teenagers Lindy-hop and pass palms 
               over their knees.

               A thin young man in a sports coat stands next to Ed, watching, 
               his Adam's apple bobbing.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Wild, man!

               He goes out onto the dance floor. Ed, left by himself, gazes 
               across the floor.

               His view, broken by dancers' crosses, shows Big Dave worriedly 
               talking to Doris.

               Doris reacts angrily.

               Big Dave morosely absorbs the angry words from Doris. He 
               glances up toward Ed and notices his gaze with consternation. 
               He gives Doris a jerk of the head, and she too looks over.

                                     VOICE
                         You in ladies' wear?

               The young man with the Adam's apple is back, looking out at 
               the floor, snapping his fingers.

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Haven't I seen you up in ladies' 
                         wear?

                                     ED
                         I don't work here. My wife does.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Uh-huh. Some beat, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     YOUNG MAN
                         Check out the rack on that broad in 
                         the angora.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               A hand is laid on Ed's shoulder. It is Big Dave; he leans in 
               to murmur:

                                     DAVE
                         Ed. Can I talk to you?

               BIG DAVE'S OFFICE

               Music from the party drifts in only faintly. The office is 
               built into a corner of the sales floor. It is dominated by a 
               large desk. A large window on the far side affords a partial 
               view of the floor.

                                     DAVE
                         Siddown. Siddown...

               Ed sits in a leather chair in front of the desk. Dave fumbles 
               nervously on top of the desk for a cigar. He trims the end 
               of the cigar with a short double-bladed knife with a steel 
               grip.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Souveniered it off a Jap in New 
                         Guinea.

               He hands one cigar to Ed, takes one for himself, then drags 
               up a chair to face Ed's.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I guess you're wondering what 
                         Doris was so hot about.

               The office is dark, the only illumination coming from the 
               window onto the bright sales floor behind Big Dave. Ed leans 
               forward for Dave to light his cigar.

                                     DAVE
                         ...These're Havanas. Romeo and 
                         Juliets. Private stock.

               Dave, having lit Ed's cigar, draws nervously on his own.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Ed, I...

                                     ED
                         What is it, Dave?

               Dave breaks down, weeping. He buries his face in his hands, 
               the burning cigar in his right hand perilously close to his 
               hair.

                                     DAVE
                         Ed, I've been weak...

               His shoulders heave.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... I've, uh... thanks.

               Ed has taken Dave's cigar so that he won't burn himself.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I've, uh... Oh, Jesus. I've been 
                         carrying on with a married woman. 
                         Uh, no one you know. And now the, uh--
                         what is it they say?--the--the--the 
                         chickens are coming home to roost.

               Ed awkwardly holds the two burning cigars.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, 
                         uh, that's not the worst of it. I 
                         got a note. A blackmail note. You 
                         know, come across or everybody knows.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, you know what that would do to 
                         me.

                                     ED
                         I guess it would be pretty awkward.

                                     DAVE
                         Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my 
                         keister! Hell, it's her family's 
                         store--*her* store. I serve at the 
                         indulgence of the goddamn ownership, 
                         Ed.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     DAVE
                         I only work here! And the lady's 
                         husband would know... Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         How much to they want, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         $10,000! I don't know what to do, 
                         Ed. I don't know what I *can* do. 
                         Even though I know who the sonofabitch 
                         is.

                                     ED
                         ...You know... who *who* is?

                                     DAVE
                         The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. 
                         It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's 
                         a businessman from Sacramento. A 
                         goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope 
                         me into some crackpot scheme; I heard 
                         him out and then told him to go to 
                         hell. And the very next day, the 
                         very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed 
                         for the same amount.

                                     ED
                         Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.

                                     DAVE
                         Well, I guess he don't care that 
                         it's obvious.

                                     ED
                         Mm. How, uh... how did he know that--

                                     DAVE
                         He's staying at the hotel I've gone 
                         to with, uh, with the lady in 
                         question. Must've seen us.

               Big Dave blows his nose, reaches to take his cigar from Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Thanks...

               He exhales with a long sigh.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Oh, Jesus.

                                     ED
                         ...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         That's my capitalization on the Annex! 
                         *My* operation, Ed! Christ almighty. 
                         That's what I was just talking to 
                         Doris about, a way of getting the 
                         money from the store that we could 
                         hide from Ann.

                                     ED
                         Mm.

                                     DAVE
                         Embezzling, Ed. From my own goddamn 
                         wife!

               He give a tearful chuckle.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Doris, she was pretty hot about 
                         that. God bless her. She doesn't 
                         know I'm telling you this--she's mad 
                         enough already. But Jesus, Ed, you're 
                         the only one I can talk to. I'm, I'm 
                         sorry I... I better get back to the 
                         party.

               He rises and clears his throat as he rubs the tears from his 
               face.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I look all right?

               PULLING ED

               He has left the office to wander through an adjacent room 
               lit only by spill from the party. It is the music department; 
               pianos and spinets are arranged across the floor.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         In a way I felt bad for Big Dave. I 
                         knew the ten grand was going to pinch 
                         him where it hurt...

               Ed sits on a piano stool next to a standing ashtray. He takes 
               out a cigarette, lights it off his cigar, stubs out the cigar.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But Doris was two-timing me and I 
                         guess, somewhere, that pinched a 
                         little too.

               His attention is caught by a distant knock of wood. Someone 
               is raising the key-guard on a piano across the room.

               The person can only be seen only obscurely, from three-
               quarters behind, through the sales floor's jumble of 
               haphazardly arranged instruments. The person begins to play.

               Ed listens. The piece is slow, sweet, almost a lullaby.

               The player, unaware that there is an audience, plays on, and 
               Ed listens, eyes narrowed against the smoke curling past his 
               face.

               The piece ends.

                                     ED
                         That was pretty.

               The player turns, surprised. It is a young woman.

                                     ED
                         ...Did you make that up?

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         Oh, no. That was written by Mr Ludwig 
                         van Beethoven.

               Ed nods recognition of the name.

                                     ED
                         That was quite something.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         He wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.

                                     ED
                         That was something. I'm Ed Crane.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         I know who you are, Mr Crane.

               His look shows surprise.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...My father used to take me with 
                         him when he got his hair cut. Walter 
                         Abundas?

               Ed's head tilts back in acknowledgment.

                                     YOUNG WOMAN
                         ...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls 
                         me Birdy.

                                     ED
                         Sorry, I just didn't remember.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, that's all right. You can't be 
                         expected to remember every skinny 
                         girl who comes in with her dad.

               Ed give a wry smile.

                                     ED
                         ...You don't like the music out there?

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. 
                         I'm not big on music, ordinarily.

               A woman calls sharply from offscreen:

                                     VOICE
                         Ed.

               He looks.

               Silhouetted in the doorway to the party room is Doris, coat 
               over her arm, purse in hand.

               ED'S CAR

               Doris and Ed are driving home.

               Doris draws heavily on a cigarette, looking flintily out at 
               the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     DORIS
                         Dave.

                                     ED
                         How's that?

                                     DORIS
                         Ahh...

               She waves angrily.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Money problems. He's thinking 
                         about canceling the Annex.

                                     ED
                         So?

                                     DORIS
                         *That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*

                                     ED
                         Mm.

               They ride in silence for a beat. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What a knucklehead.

               STREET

               As the car roars past and into the distance.

               ANOTHER STREET

               It is day. We are looking from inside a parked car toward a 
               hotel entrance. Big Dave emerges from the hotel, gets into a 
               Packard and drives off.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Big Dave did it, though...

               Ed, sitting in his car, is watching.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sent a note telling him where 
                         to drop the money...

               HOTEL HALLWAY

               Ed emerges from a stairwell and goes to a standing ashtray 
               by the elevator.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and he did. He came across.

               Ed reaches into the trash hole in the ashtray column and 
               pulls out a Nirdlinger's bag.

               He goes back to the stairwell.

               ANOTHER FLOOR

               Ed emerges from the stairwell, goes to a door and knocks.

               The door swings open.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good, how are ya, come in...

               Ed follows him into the room.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...You bring a check?

                                     ED
                         Cash.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Cash?!

               He gives Ed a look.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Usually we do this kind of thing 
                         with a bank draft. But cash--that's 
                         fine--it's all the same in the end--
                         dough's dough, huh?

                                     ED
                         Sure.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         I got the paperwork here. Partnership 
                         papers here, they reflect our 
                         agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I 
                         supply professional services, you 
                         supply the capital. I'll give you a 
                         receipt on the dough there, huh?

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Pretty straightforward, but I don't 
                         know if you wanna show this stuff to 
                         a lawyer--

                                     ED
                         It's OK.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, screw 'em, huh? Pay 'em to 
                         tangle it up and then you pay 'em to 
                         untangle it, what's the point?

               He perspires as he counts the money.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Just a second here, I'll give you 
                         a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, 
                         Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't 
                         talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm 
                         gonna call the place Tolliver's, 
                         after me, you know, I didn't think 
                         you were much interested in, uh--

                                     ED
                         That'll be fine.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...

               He wipes his brow, finishes counting.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         ...Yeah, that's it. As per our 
                         discussion.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

               Creighton hands Ed an executed agreement and a receipt.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         Well, there it is. Writ large in 
                         legal escriture, next step is--

                                     ED
                         Look, uh... Creighton...

               He gives Creighton a level stare, smoke pluming from the 
               cigarette planted in his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...You're not gonna screw me on this?

                                     CREIGHTON
                         *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a 
                         lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* 
                         cleaning, this is not some fly-by-
                         night thing here! I must say, I've 
                         been an entrepreneur for thirteen 
                         years and I've never--

                                     ED
                         All right.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         And I've never been asked--Look, you 
                         want the dough back? You know who I 
                         am! You--

                                     ED
                         OK.

               Creighton mops his brow again.

                                     CREIGHTON
                         So, uh... Tolliver's is OK then?

               CAR

               Ed drives with the usual cigarette in his mouth. Doris sits 
               next to him. Rural scenery slips by in the background.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The next day was Saturday. We were 
                         going to a reception for Doris' cousin 
                         Gina, who'd just married a wop vintner 
                         out near Modesto. Doris didn't much 
                         feel like going, and I didn't either, 
                         but, like she said, we had a 
                         Commitment.

               Doris gazes stonily out at the road. At length:

                                     DORIS
                         ...I hate wops.

               Ed gives her a brief glance. Doris glares at him.

                                     DORIS
                         ...What's so damn strange about that?

                                     ED
                         I didn't say a word.

               She looks back out at the road.

                                     DORIS
                         ...*You* didn't have to grow up with 
                         'em.

               This brings nothing from Ed. Doris shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...Family. Boy.

               BY A BARN

               Wops in Sunday clothing greet each other around tables piled 
               with food.

               A small child runs up to his mother, yanks on her dress and 
               screams:

                                     CHILD
                         He's ridin' Garibaldi! Uncle Frankie's 
                         ridin' Garibaldi!

               Surrounded by cheering children, with a jug of wine slung 
               over his shoulder, Frank is riding an enormous pig. He slaps 
               at the pig's ass with a large straw hat.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         That was when she started drinking.

               Doris is standing by one of the tables, drinking red wine 
               from a water glass. Ed stands nearby.

               A large woman hugs Doris.

                                     WOMAN
                         How you doin', Doris, you been OK?

                                     DORIS
                         How're you, Constanza?

                                     WOMAN
                         Oh, you know, I got my healt'. And 
                         how you been, uh...

                                     ED
                         Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Ed. How's a business?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     WOMAN
                              (to Doris)
                         He's a barber, right? It's a good 
                         trade. So how come you got no kids?

               PICNIC TABLE

               A group of kids pulls Frank, laughing, by the hand toward a 
               picnic table set out with pies in a row.

                                     VOICES
                         Uncle Frankie's gotta join! Wait for 
                         Frankie!

                                     FRANK
                         No, come on, kids--I just ate lunch!

                                     VOICES
                         No, no--Uncle Frankie's gotta join!

               An old man stands by with a stopwatch.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Ready...

               He clicks the timer.

                                     OLD MAN
                         ...Go!

               Frank and the line of children plunge their faces into the 
               line of blueberry pies.

               The other picnickers cheer them on.

               ELSEWHERE

               Ed and Doris approach the innocent-looking young couple 
               accepting congratulations.

               Doris, holding her empty glass, is not a happy drunk:

                                     DORIS
                         'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn 
                         wonderful.

                         Life is so goddamn wonderful, you 
                         almost won't believe it.

                         I'm sure.

               Ed tries to lead her away.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

               Doris calls back over her shoulder:

                                     DORIS
                         Congratulations on your goddamn 
                         cherries!

               As Ed and Doris recede we hear her petulant:

                                     DORIS
                         ...Leggo my goddamn elbow.

               ELSEWHERE

               In a long shot we see Frank at the crest of a hill, staggering 
               slowly, painfully, toward a tree. In his right hand he 
               clutches a trophy.

               When he reaches the tree he swings his free hand up against 
               it, leans forward, and vomits.

               CAR

               Late afternoon, driving home.

               Ed drives. Doris sits in the front passenger seat, snoring 
               lightly. Frank sits in the back seat hugging his trophy to 
               his chest, eyes closed, murmuring:

                                     FRANK
                         I never wanna see another blueberry 
                         pie...

               Silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...I never even wanna hear those 
                         words.

               Doris moans.

               More silence.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Don't says those words, Ed.

               EXT. BUNGALOW

               It is twilight. Ed's coupe is parked in the driveway. He is 
               just rounding the back of the car to open the passenger-side 
               door. He pulls Doris from the car, half asleep, half drunk.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               The door swings open and Ed stumbles in supporting Doris, 
               who has one arm draped around his neck. He helps her into 
               the bedroom and eases her onto the bed.

               He sits on the edge of the bed and looks down at her.

               Shadows from branches just outside wave across her face. She 
               is breathing through her open mouth; her face is moist with 
               perspiration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I'd met Doris blind on a double-date 
                         with a loudmouthed buddy of mine who 
                         was seeing a friend of hers from 
                         work. We went to a movie; Doris had 
                         a flask; we killed it. She could put 
                         it away. At the end of the night she 
                         said she liked it I didn't talk much. 
                         A couple weeks later she suggested--

               A harsh jangle from the telephone. Doris moans but does not 
               wake; Ed rises and does to the living room and picks up the 
               phone.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     VOICE
                         Ed, it's Big Dave. I gotta talk to 
                         you.

                                     ED
                         What--now?

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

                                     ED
                         But it's...

                                     DAVE
                         Please, Ed.

               Ed sighs.

                                     ED
                         Your place?

                                     DAVE
                         I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself 
                         in.

                                     ED
                         OK.

               He hangs up.

               He nudges Doris.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She murmurs.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey.

               She rolls away and burrows into a pillow.

               Ed opens her purse and pokes through it.

               NIRDLINGER'S

               We are looking over Ed's shoulder as he hesitantly swings 
               open a door.

               It reveals Big Dave's office, quiet and rather dark.

               A down-facing banker's lamp on the desk illuminates Big Dave's 
               hands on the desktop.

                                     ED
                         ...Dave?

                                     DAVE
                         Come on in.

               Ed enters, sits.

               An awkward silence.

                                     ED
                         ...What's the problem, Big Dave?

               Another silence.

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm ruined.

               His hands writhe on the desktop.

                                     DAVE
                         ...It ruined me. This money. No annex. 
                         I'm all shot to hell.

                                     ED
                         So you paid the guy?

               Big Dave stares without speaking.

               After a long beat:

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         ...Huh?

                                     DAVE
                         What kind of man *are* you?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave--

                                     DAVE
                         I'd understand if you'd walked in 
                         here. Socked me in the nose. Whatever. 
                         I deserved it.

                                     ED
                         I, uh...

                                     DAVE
                         I'm not proud of what I did. But 
                         *you*.

               No one talks.

               Big Dave sighs.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Yeah, I paid up. As you well know. 
                         And then I went and found the pansy.

               He looks at Ed.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Got nothin' to say, huh? Yeah, 
                         well, you already know the story. I 
                         didn't, I hadda beat it out of the 
                         pansy. *Your* money.

               No response.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave rises.

                                     DAVE
                         ...Well.

               He crosses around the desk and adds, sadly:

                                     DAVE
                         ...I'm all shot to hell.

               Ed starts to rise, but Big Dave is already looming over him. 
               Big Dave bear-hugs him and then spins him into a wall.

               Ed hits the wall and bounces off, back into Big Dave. Big 
               Dave wallops him in the stomach. Ed doubles over.

                                     DAVE
                         ...What kind of man *are* you?

               Big Dave hurls him against the desk, then slams his face 
               against the desktop. Ed's hands scrabble at the top of the 
               desk as Big Dave grabs him by the neck and lifts. He slams 
               him face-first into the window between the office and the 
               dark sales floor.

               Ed twists around, the back of his head now pressed against 
               the glass. Big Dave's hands lock around his throat.

               Big Dave sweats and strains.

               A crack shoots up the pane of glass.

               Ed's hand sweeps up and plunges something into Big Dave's 
               neck.

               Big Dave grunts and turns away, gurgling. His hands go up to 
               his throat.

               Ed watches. He is holding Big Dave's cigar trimmer.

               Big Dave takes a couple of deliberate steps backward, his 
               head twisted away.

               He falls back, tripped up by a chair, which spins him face-
               down onto the floor.

               Big Dave crawls away face-down across the floor, on his knees 
               but with his hands still at his throat. His face and knees 
               awkwardly support his weight as if he were pushing something 
               across the floor with his nose.

               He reaches a corner but still pushes forward, wedging himself 
               in, legs still scraping away as if to push himself through 
               the wall. Blood is pooling out from under him.

               Big Dave's legs are still working. His gurgling continues.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave's legs start to move furiously. They convulse. His 
               whole body shakes as he goes into shock.

               Ed watches.

               Big Dave stops shaking. He remains wedged awkwardly into the 
               corner, face-down. He is still.

               The room is very quiet.

               Ed looks down at his hands.

               He walks across the room, pushes the door open and walks 
               across the darkened sales floor.

               EXT. STORE

               Ed walks to his car. He does not look about, is not 
               particularly furtive. He gets into the car. He starts the 
               ignition.

               EXT. HOUSE

               He pulls up, sits motionless for a beat. Gradually, something 
               draws his attention; he cocks his head and looks up through 
               the windshield.

               A branch creaks and sways in the breeze.

               INT. HOUSE

               Ed gets into bed next to Doris. He stares at the ceiling. 
               Wind rustles outside.

               The shadow of a branch on the ceiling nods in time with the 
               wind.

               He looks at Doris.

               Her face is still lightly sheened with sweat but her mouth 
               is closed now, her breathing more peaceful. The leafy shadows 
               play over her face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...It was only a couple of weeks 
                         after we met that Doris suggested 
                         getting married. I said, Don't you 
                         wanna get to know me more? She said, 
                         Why, does it get better? She looked 
                         at me like I was a dope, which I've 
                         never really minded from her. And 
                         she had a point, I guess. We knew 
                         each other as well then as now...

               He is gazing at her.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, well enough.

               Sound and image face.

               BARBERSHOP

               The next day.

               Ed cuts hair, a cigarette between his lips.

                                     FRANK
                         Holy-moly, do I got a headache.

               Frank is giving a haircut as well.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How you today, Ed?

                                     ED
                         OK.

                                     FRANK
                         You don't got a headache?

                                     ED
                         ...Nah.

                                     FRANK
                         Damn, I got a headache to beat the 
                         band.

               LATER

               Ed sits in his chair, hands folded in his lap, head tilted 
               back, eyes closed.

               We hold on Ed as we hear a clipper buzzing and Frank talking 
               to someone in his chair.

                                     FRANK
                         Ya can't pump it. Did ya pump it? 
                         That'll just flood it.

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Ya gotta pump it. Ya can't just hold 
                         it down. *That'll* flood it.

                                     FRANK
                         You crazy? You pumped it?

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Well, ya can't hold it down.

               There is the jingle of the door bell. Ed opens his eyes.

               Two men in fedoras are entering.

               Ed starts to rise.

                                     MAN 1
                         Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Right.

                                     MAN 1
                         Come on outside.

                                     ED
                         Sure.

               OUTSIDE

               The two men are staring at the sidewalk, smoking, hesitant 
               to speak. One of them finally comes up with an icebreaker:

                                     MAN 2
                         ...So you're a barber, huh?

                                     ED
                         That's right.

                                     MAN 1
                         I'm Officer Persky. This is Krebs.

               Ed nods toward their car:

                                     ED
                         ...We goin'?

                                     KREBS
                         Huh? No.

               Beat.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Cigarette?

               Ed holds up one hand with its smoking cigarette.

                                     PERSKY
                         Right. Uh... Pete's got some news 
                         for you.

               His partner gives Persky a dirty look.

                                     KREBS
                         ...Look, pal, it's a tough break, 
                         but, uh... well damnit, your wife's 
                         been pinched.

                                     PERSKY
                         They sent us to tell ya.

                                     ED
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         They sent us to tell ya. We pulled 
                         the detail.

                                     ED
                         My *wife*?

                                     PERSKY
                         Yeah, uh, they brung her to the county 
                         jail, uh...

                                     KREBS
                         Homicide.

                                     PERSKY
                         Well, embezzlement. And homicide. A 
                         guy named David Brewster. He's, uh... 
                         He's the decedent.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     KREBS
                         He's the dead guy.

               Ed stares at him.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Yeah, it's a tough break.

                                     KREBS
                         Visiting ends at five. Too late today. 
                         You can see her tomorrow.

                                     PERSKY
                         Sorry, pal. They sent us to tell ya.

               He shakes his head.

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Crap detail.

               RESIDENTIAL STREET

               It is evening. Ed is pulling up to a house on a tree-lined 
               street similar to his own. He gets out of his car and goes 
               up the walk, and a man sitting on the porch swing holds up a 
               hand of greeting.

                                     MAN
                         'Lo, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Walter.

               He steps up on the porch.

               The man is holding a tumbler of whiskey and ice that clinks 
               as the swing moves. His skin glistens with drinker's sweat, 
               and he has the slightly expansive manner of someone who's 
               put at least a couple away.

                                     WALTER
                         Have a seat.

               Ed glances around but the swing is the only seat. He sits 
               next to Walter.

                                     ED
                         Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at 
                         home.

                                     WALTER
                         Oh, hell. Drink?

                                     ED
                         No thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Sure you don't need one?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine.

                                     WALTER
                         OK. Boy. Jesus!

                                     ED
                         Yeah. What do I, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, of course, I, uh, it's out of 
                         my league, criminal stuff. I do, uh, 
                         probate, real estate, title search, 
                         uh... I'd be absolutely worthless, 
                         something like this. Absolutely 
                         worthless.

               He belches.

                                     WALTER
                         'Scuse me, just finished dinner. Um. 
                         Frankly, Doris'd be better off with 
                         the county defender.

                                     ED
                         He a good man?

                                     WALTER
                         Bert's OK, sure, he's a good man. I 
                         won't kid you though, Ed, nobody 
                         around here has any experience with 
                         this kind of, er... And I hear they're 
                         bringing a prosecutor up from 
                         Sacramento. Capital offense. Taking 
                         it seriously... Hmm...

                                     ED
                         So--

                                     WALTER
                         Taking it seriously.

                                     ED
                         So, who should I--

               The front door opens and someone speaks through the screen:

                                     VOICE
                         You want any coffee, Dad?

               Ed looks around at the voice.

                                     VOICE
                         Oh, hello, Mr Crane.

               She steps out: it is Birdy Abundas.

               Ed rises, and they awkwardly shake hands.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Rachel.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.

                                     ED
                         Yeah. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         Coffee, Ed?

                                     ED
                         I'm fine. Thanks.

                                     WALTER
                         No thanks, honey.

                                     BIRDY
                         OK. Nice to see you, Mr Crane.

               They watch her go back in.

                                     WALTER
                         Damnit! She's a good kid.

               Ed nods.

               A beat.

                                     ED
                         ...So, uh, who should I--

                                     WALTER
                         Well, there's Lloyd Garroway in San 
                         Francisco. Probity--you know, no one 
                         ever said anything iffy about Lloyd 
                         Garroway. Conservative. Jury might 
                         like that. Might like that here.

               He takes a sip of his drink.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Probity.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, 
                         uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Well, the best, the money-is-no-object 
                         best, for a criminal case, any lawyer 
                         would tell you Freddy Riedenschneider. 
                         Out of Sacramento. 'Course, I don't 
                         know how you're fixed for money.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh. He's the, uh...

                                     WALTER
                         Yeah, the best.

               He sniffs.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Yeah, Riedenschneider. Wish I 
                         could tell you more. Hell, I wish I 
                         could handle it myself. But I'd be 
                         absolutely worthless for this kind 
                         of thing.

               He takes a musing sip.

                                     WALTER
                         ...Criminal matter? Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider.

               He thinks.

                                     WALTER
                         ...No question about it.

               ED AT A TABLE

               It is a long table with chairs stretching down both sides, 
               one side for prisoners, the other for visitors. The room is 
               empty except for a guard and an elderly woman who sits across 
               from a younger woman at the far end of the table. The younger 
               woman, in a prison smock, is wailing. The elderly woman is 
               holding her hand.

               Ed sits across from an empty chair, clutching a flower-printed 
               toiletries kit. There are echoing voices suggesting large 
               spaces outside the room.

               He sits and waits.

               Approaching footsteps.

               The door opens. A large prison matron steps aside to let 
               Doris enter.

               Doris looks lost in a prison-issue jumper that is too big 
               for her. Her hair is uncurled and bedraggled. Not only is 
               she not made-up, she has a couple of bruises and a cut on 
               her lip.

               As Ed stands, she gives a hollow look around.

                                     ED
                         Honey... I brought your make-up.

               She looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Honey.

                                     ED
                         How are you?

               She shrugs.

                                     DORIS
                         I don't know what's going on. I--

                                     ED
                         What happened to you?

               She shakes her head.

                                     DORIS
                         ...I don't know what happened to Big 
                         Dave. I know some of it. 
                         Irregularities in my books, they 
                         said. Can I explain it.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to--

                                     DORIS
                         I helped him cook the books, Ed. I 
                         did do that.

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell them anything. 
                         We're getting you a lawyer.

               Doris doesn't seem to be listening. She sighs:

                                     DORIS
                         I know all about that. But I don't 
                         know how much to tell them.

                                     ED
                         Don't tell 'em anything. We're getting 
                         you Freddy Riedenschneider.

               Doris finally looks at him.

                                     DORIS
                         Should I... should I tell you why?

                                     ED
                         You don't have to tell me anything.

               Her gaze drifts away again. She notices the sobbing woman.

                                     DORIS
                         Jesus Christ.

               Doris looks around and laughs.

                                     DORIS
                         ...My books used to be perfect. Anyone 
                         could open them up, make sense of 
                         the whole goddamn store.

                                     ED
                         Honey...

                                     DORIS
                         I knew we'd pay for it.

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed sits in a waiting-customer chair, wearing his smock. Frank 
               paces in front of him. He smacks a fist into his palm.

                                     FRANK
                         This is what family is for, Ed! This 
                         is when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     FRANK
                         Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons 
                         of bitches!

                                     ED
                         Frank, uh, you know I'll try to 
                         contribute, but, uh--Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider--

                                     FRANK
                         I don't care what it costs! This is 
                         when ya come together!

                                     ED
                         That's very generous.

                                     FRANK
                         The hell with it, Eddie!

               BANK

               Ed and Frank sit waiting on a bench in the high-vaulted lobby. 
               Frank looks uncomfortable in an ill-fitting suit. As they 
               wait, he looks nervously about.

               In a hushed voice:

                                     FRANK
                         They're just people like you and me, 
                         Ed. Remember that.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         Just people. They gotta put up the 
                         big front so that people will trust 
                         them with their money. This is why 
                         the big lobby, Ed. But they put their 
                         pants on one leg at a time. Just 
                         like you and me.

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     FRANK
                         They too use the toilet, Ed. In spite 
                         of appearances. And their money will 
                         be secured by the barbershop. A rock. 
                         A *rock*, the barbershop. I mean, 
                         how long has *this* place been here?

               A door opens. A conservatively dressed man of late middle 
               age emerges.

                                     MAN
                         Mr Raffo?

               Frank hops to his feet.

                                     FRANK
                         Yes, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Could you come with me please?

                                     FRANK
                         Sure. Can Ed come too?

               The man looks dubiously at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         Mr...?

                                     ED
                         Crane. Ed Crane.

                                     MAN
                         You also have an interest in the 
                         securing property?

                                     FRANK
                         He's a barber.

                                     MAN
                         Ah.

                                     FRANK
                         Second chair.

                                     MAN
                         Not an owner.

                                     FRANK
                         No, he's family, he's my brother-in-
                         law.

                                     MAN
                         Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited 
                         here.

               He goes to the glass-paned doorway to his office, Frank 
               trailing dejectedly behind. They enter, the door closes, and 
               we hear their muffled voices from inside, the sense of the 
               words lost.

               Ed sits and watches the two men perform their pantomime of 
               business: Frank nervously reads documents with one hand cupped 
               to his forehead for concentration; the banker passes 
               successive documents across his desk with a word of 
               explanation for each as Frank signs.

               Ed takes out a cigarette and lights it, watching impassively.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The barbershop. Doris and Frank's 
                         father had worked thirty years to 
                         own it free and clear. Now it got 
                         signed over to the bank, and the 
                         bank signed some money over to Frank, 
                         and Frank signed the money over...

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               It is midday. We are tracking along the sidewalk toward a 
               long cream-colored Packard parked at the curb. A couple of 
               kids have stopped to peer into the car's windows; the car is 
               no doubt the fanciest in town.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...to Freddy Riedenschneider, who 
                         got into town two days later...

               Ed, coming up the sidewalk, looks up at the storefront: a 
               restaurant with a large window with a plush red drape that 
               obscures the interior. Gilt lettering on the window spells 
               out "DaVinci's".

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and told me to meet him at 
                         DaVinci's for lunch.

               TRACKING POINT OF VIEW

               Inside the restaurant. We are tracking toward a table whose 
               lone occupant sits with his back to us holding open a menu 
               as he orders from a facing waitress:

                                     MAN
                         ...not fried, poached. Three of 'em 
                         for two minutes. A strip steak medium 
                         rare, flapjacks, potatoes, tomato 
                         juice, and plenty of hot coffee.

               He flips the menu over.

                                     MAN
                         ...Do you have prairie oysters?

                                     WAITRESS
                         No, sir.

                                     MAN
                         Then bring me a fruit cocktail while 
                         I wait.

               He looks up at Ed.

                                     MAN
                         ...You're Ed Crane?

                                     ED
                         Yeah--

                                     MAN
                         Barber, right? I'm Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider. Hungry? They tell 
                         me the chow's OK here. I made some 
                         inquiries.

                                     ED
                         No thanks, I--

               The waitress sets a fruit cocktail in front of 
               Riedenschneider.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Look, I don't wanna waste your time 
                         so I'll eat while we talk. Ya mind?  
                         *You* don't mind. So while I'm in 
                         town I'll be staying at the Hotel 
                         Metropole, the Turandot Suite. Yeah, 
                         it's goofy, the suites're named after 
                         operas; room's OK though, I poked 
                         around. I'm having 'em hold it for 
                         me on account of I'll be back and 
                         forth. In addition to my retainer, 
                         you're paying hotel, living expenses, 
                         secretarial, private eye if we need 
                         to make inquiries, headshrinker should 
                         we go that way. We'll talk about 
                         appeals if, as and when. For right 
                         now, has she confessed?

                                     ED
                         No. Of course not. She didn't do it.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! That helps. Not that she didn't 
                         do it, that she didn't confess. Of 
                         course, there's ways to deal with a 
                         confession, but that's good!--one 
                         less thing to think about. Now. 
                         Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. 
                         You should be there. Three o'clock. 
                         One more thing: you keep your mouth 
                         shut. I get the lay of the land, I 
                         tell *you* what to say. No talking 
                         out of school. What's out of school? 
                         Everything's out of school. I do the 
                         talking; you keep your trap shut. 
                         I'm an attorney, you're a barber; 
                         you don't know anything. Understood?

                                     ED
                         ...OK.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Good! Any questions give me a ring--
                         Turandot suite; if I'm out leave a 
                         message. You sure you don't want 
                         anything? No?

               He points a finger at Ed.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...You're OK, pal. You're OK, she's 
                         OK. Everything's gonna be hunky-dory.

               The waitress puts down a plate of steak and eggs.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And the flapjacks, honey.

               DRIVING POINT OF VIEW

               We are looking at pedestrians on the sidewalk through the 
               windshield of a moving car.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         All going about their business. It 
                         seemed like I knew a secret--a bigger 
                         one even then what had really happened 
                         to Big Dave, something none of them 
                         knew...

               On Ed, driving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Like I had made it to the outside, 
                         somehow, and they were all still 
                         struggling, way down below.

               ED IN BED

               Arms folded behind his head, staring at the ceiling.

               On the ceiling is the moving shadow of a tree limb.

               A distant, muffled knock.

               Ed turns his head.

               FRONT DOOR

               Ed opens it as he finishes cinching a bathrobe.

               The woman waiting on the front porch is dressed in black: a 
               black dress and a black veiled hat that is too big for her 
               bird-like frame.

               Wind rustles in the trees behind her.

               She stares at Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann.

               For the first time, we hear her speak, in a low, tremulous 
               voice:

                                     ANN
                         Hello, Ed.

                                     ED
                         Ann. Will you come in?

               She shakes her head.

                                     ANN
                         ...No, No, it's very late.

               Ed nods.

               After an uncomfortable beat, through which she continues to 
               stare:

                                     ED
                         ...I'm so sorry about your loss.

                                     ANN
                         Yes. Thank you.

                                     ED
                         Of course, you know, Doris had nothing 
                         to do with it. Nothing at all.

               She lays a black-gloved hand on his arm.

                                     ANN
                         Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came 
                         to tell you...

                                     ED
                         Yes, Ann?

                                     ANN
                         And you should tell Doris...

               She falls silent. The trees behind her rustle.

               She gives a wary look back. Then, confidingly, to Ed:

                                     ANN
                         ...You know how Big Dave loved 
                         camping. And the out-of-doors.

               Ed is puzzled:

                                     ED
                         Yes?

                                     ANN
                         We went camping last summer. In 
                         Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, 
                         Ed.

               She gives him a searching look, hoping, it seems, that he 
               will find this significant.

                                     ED
                         ...Yes?

                         At night, there were lights--we both 
                         saw them. We never told anyone, 
                         outside of our official report.

                                     ED

                         A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. 
                         They led Big Dave onto the craft. He 
                         never told anyone what they did, 
                         outside of his report. Of course he 
                         told *me*. No one else.

                         it to you. But this thing goes deep, 
                         Ed. This was not your wife. I goes

                         There is a great deal of fear. You

                         it--the knowledge--a threat. They 
                         try to limit it, and--

                                     ED
                         Ann, will you come in, sit down, 
                         maybe have a drink?

                                     ANN
                         Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. 
                         After this happened, things changed. 
                         Big Dave... he never touched me again.

               Ed says nothing.

               She touches his arm.

                                     ANN
                         ...Tell Doris not to worry. I know 
                         it wasn't her. Perhaps this will 
                         bring it out, finally. Perhaps now 
                         it will all come out.

               She turns and heads down the walk.

               Her high-heeled footsteps echo on the walk, then the sidewalk, 
               then are lost in the rustle of leaves.

               Ed watches her go: a small black figure, growing smaller.

               PRISON MEETING ROOM

               It is an unadorned room with a simple wooden table and chairs. 
               One high window lets in a shaft of sunlight.

               Ed and Doris sit at the table; Freddy Riedenschneider stands 
               to one side staring up at the high window, hands dug into 
               his pockets.

               All three are motionless for a long beat. Finally:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It stinks.

                                     DORIS
                         But it's true.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't care it's true, it's not 
                         true; it stinks. You say he was being 
                         blackmailed; by who? You don't know. 
                         For having an affair; with who? You 
                         don't know. Did anyone else know 
                         about it? Probably not; you don't 
                         know.

                                     ED
                         I knew about it. Big Dave told me 
                         about it, and the spot he was putting 
                         himself in by getting the money.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Terrific. Your husband backs you up. 
                         That's terrific.

               He starts pacing.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...You've gotta give me something to 
                         work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is 
                         good, but he's not a magician. He 
                         can't just wave his little wand in 
                         the air and make a plausible defense 
                         materialize. Look. Look at what the 
                         other side is gonna run at us. They 
                         got the company books, prepared by 
                         you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. 
                         They got a murder scene *you* had 
                         access to. That's Opportunity. They 
                         got that little trimmer thing he was 
                         stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* 
                         weapon--

                                     ED
                         It was Big Dave's.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         --don't interrupt me--that's Means. 
                         They got a fine upstanding pillar of 
                         the business community as a victim, 
                         and then they got *you*, a disgruntled 
                         number-juggling underling who on the 
                         day in question was drunk as a skunk 
                         and whose alibi for the time in 
                         question is being passed out at home, 
                         alone.

                                     ED
                         *I* was with her.

               Riedenschneider gives him a hard look.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Like I say, it stinks.

               Another long pause.

                                     ED
                         ...I killed him.

               Riedenschneider eyes him. Wheels start turning.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         OK, we forget the blackmail. *You* 
                         killed him. How come?

                                     ED
                         He and Doris... were having an affair.

               Doris eyes him. His manner does not reveal anything.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         OK, how did you know?

                                     ED
                         I... just knew. A husband knows.

               Riedenschneider rolls his eyes.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone else say they knew?

                                     ED
                         I don't know. I don't think so.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         How did you get into the store?

                                     ED
                         I took Doris's keys.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone say they saw you there? 
                         On your way there? In there? On your 
                         was back?

                                     ED
                         ...I don't think so.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Will anyone corroborate and goddamn 
                         part of your story at all?

               Ed returns Riedenschneider's stare. Riedenschneider resumes 
               pacing.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Come on, people. You can't help 
                         each other like that. Let's be 
                         realistic now. Let's look at our 
                         options. Well, frankly, I don't *see* 
                         any options.

               A nod of the head indicates Doris:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...I cannot present Story A.

               Another nod indicates Ed:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...I cannot present Story B. I could 
                         plead you for a nutcase but you look 
                         too composed. I could offer a guilty 
                         plea and in return they don't give 
                         you the juice, but I don't think you 
                         want to spend the rest of your life 
                         in Chino and I know you didn't hire 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider to hold your 
                         hand at a sentencing hearing. Hell, 
                         you could've gotten Lloyd Garroway 
                         for that. No, we're not giving up 
                         yet; you hired Freddy Riedenschneider, 
                         it means you're *not* throwing in 
                         the towel. I litigate, I don't 
                         capitulate. All right, no options, 
                         we gotta think. All right, we go 
                         back to the blackmail thing. It 
                         titillates, it's open ended...

               His pacing becomes more animated.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...And it makes *him* the bad guy--
                         ya dig around, ya never know, 
                         something unsavory from his past, he 
                         approaches you to help with the money, 
                         it's too late, his past comes back 
                         to haunt him, who's to say...

               He is heading for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah. OK. Forget the jealous 
                         husband thing, that's silly; we're 
                         going with the blackmail. I'll be in 
                         touch.

               The door slams.

               HOTEL LOBBY

               The camera drifts in toward the reception desk. Ed talks to 
               the clerk behind the desk, but the scene plays silently; we 
               hear only Ed's narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Of course, there was *one* person 
                         who could confirm Doris's story, or 
                         plenty of it: the dry-cleaning 
                         pansy...

               The desk clerk is shaking his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But he'd left the hotel, skipped 
                         out on his bill...

               HALLWAY

               It is a rooming-house hallway. A stern middle-aged woman is 
               on the hall telephone. This too plays silently under the 
               narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He'd also disappeared from the 
                         residence he gave me...

               ED'S LIVING ROOM

               We are drifting in toward Ed, who nods at the telephone and 
               then cradles it. He stares down at the business card he holds.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...owing two month's rent. How could 
                         I have been so stupid. Handing over 
                         $10,000. For a piece of paper. And 
                         the man gone... like a ghost...

               PULLING BACK FROM ED

               In a different living room. He sits on a sofa, hands clasped 
               behind his head, listening. For the first time, as the voice-
               over continues, we hear atmosphere from the scene: piano 
               music.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...disappeared into thin air, 
                         vaporized, like the Nips at Nagasaki. 
                         Gone now. All gone. The money gone. 
                         Big Dave gone. Doris going. How could 
                         I have been so stupid?

               The continuing pull-back reveals Walter Abundas on a nearby 
               chair, also listening as Birdy plays.

               Walter holds a drink in one hand; he is nodding; his eyelids 
               droop. As the piano piece reaches its mournful conclusion 
               his chin alights on his chest, his eyelids tremble closed, 
               and he starts lightly to snore.

               BARBERSHOP

               The distinctive buzz of electric hairclippers bangs in at 
               the cut. Ed and Frank stand behind their respective chairs, 
               administering haircuts.

               The customer in Ed's chair is in white shirtsleeves that do 
               not hide rolls of fat. He has a hot towel over his face that 
               does not slow his speech, although it does muffle it to some 
               extent:

                                     CUSTOMER
                         She makes this stuff, she calls it 
                         gatto, it's got egg in there, it's 
                         got sugar, it's got--it's cake, 
                         basically, except she calls it gatto. 
                         Like if you don't call it cake maybe 
                         you won't put on any weight, like I 
                         need to eat gatto, you know what I'm 
                         saying? This stuff, if I've had a 
                         square meal, I've had my steak and 
                         potatoes, I can just have another 
                         cup of coffee afterward, I won't ask 
                         for the desert if it's not there...

               His voice turns into a drone under the narration.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Sooner or later everyone needs a 
                         haircut...

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Got the recipe from a magazine, 
                         woman's magazine...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         We were working for the bank now. We 
                         kept cutting the hair, trying to 
                         stay afloat, make the payments, tread 
                         water, day by day, day by day...

               CRANE DOWN

               Inside a courtroom we boom down toward the defendant's table, 
               the fat customer's drone turning into the drone of the bailiff 
               reading an indictment. Doris stands next to Freddy

                         Most people think someone's accused 
                         of a crime, they haul 'em in and 
                         bring 'em to trial, but it's not 
                         like that, it's not that fast. The 
                         wheels of justice turn slow...

                         They have an arraignment, and then 
                         the indictment, and they entertain 
                         motions to dismiss, and postpone, 
                         and change the venue, and alter this 
                         and that and the other. They empanel 
                         a jury, which brings more motions, 
                         and they set a trial date and then 
                         change the date, and then often as 
                         not they'll change it again.

               OPERA SINGERS

               We are panning photographic portraits of opera singers in 
               character, wearing the wardrobe of different eras, armies, 
               dukedoms, and boudoirs, and displaying the heights and depths 
               of various emotions, their mouths stretched wide in song. We 
               pan off the pictures to discover that we are in a hotel room, 
               floating in toward a bed on which Freddy Riedenschneider, a 
               mask over his eyes, slumbers.

               spaghetti with a fork against a spoon.

               LATERAL TRACK

               From inside a car. Pedestrians bustle along a sidewalk. Among 
               them scurries a weedy little man who has one hand clamped to 
               the crown of his hat to keep it in place in a stiff wind.

                         from Sacramento...

               LATERAL TRACK

               Moving the opposite way. A different day, but again a crowd 
               moves along the sidewalk, and among them the little man 
               scuttles in the opposite direction, hand still raised to his 
               hat, his forearm and the tilt of his head largely obscuring 
               his face.

               PUSHING IN TO ED

               In the Abundas living room again, again listening to Birdy 
               at the piano, but now the two of them are alone.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I found myself more and more going 
                         over to the Abundas's. It was a 
                         routine we fell into, most every 
                         evening. I even went when Walter was 
                         away on his research trips. He was a 
                         genealogist, had traced back his 
                         side of the family seven generations, 
                         his late wife's, eight. It seemed 
                         like a screwy hobby. But then maybe 
                         all hobbies are. Maybe Walter found 
                         something there, in the old county 
                         courthouses, hospital file rooms, 
                         city archives, property rolls, 
                         registries, something maybe like 
                         what I found listening to Birdy play. 
                         Some kind of escape. Some kind of 
                         peace...

               The piano music ends in a sustain which begins to fade, but 
               then is snapped by a sharp clang.

               PRISON DOOR SWINGS OPEN

               We are pushing into the high-windowed prison meeting room. 
               None of its three occupants is moving.

               The tableau consists of Doris staring down at the table; the 
               private investigator sitting on a straightbacked chair tipped 
               back against a wall, his arms folded across his chest, his 
               fedora pushed back on his head, a toothpick clamped between 
               his teeth; and Freddy Riedenschneider, standing, hands clasped 
               behind his back, gazing with a distant smile up into the 
               shaft of light that slants through the high window.

               A warder shuts the door behind Ed.

               Doris and the private investigator turn to note his entrance; 
               Riedenschneider does not.

               Ed pulls out a chair across from Doris, clasps his hands on 
               top of hers.

                                     ED
                         'Lo, honey.

               She looks at his hands on top of hers.

               A long beat.

               Still gazing up into the shaft of light, Freddy 
               Riedenschneider announces:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...They got this guy, in Germany. 
                         Fritz something-or-other. Or is it. 
                         Maybe it's Werner. Anyway, he's got 
                         this theory, you wanna test something, 
                         you know, scientifically--how the 
                         planets  go round the sun, what 
                         sunspots are made of, why the water 
                         comes out of the tap--well, you gotta 
                         look at it. But sometimes, you look 
                         at it, your looking *changes* it. Ya 
                         can't know the reality of what 
                         happened, or what *would've* happened 
                         if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn 
                         schnozz. So there *is* no 'what 
                         happened.' Not in any sense that we 
                         can grasp with our puny minds. Because 
                         our minds... out minds get in the 
                         way. Looking at something changes 
                         it. They call it the 'Uncertainty 
                         Principle.' Sure, it sounds screwy, 
                         but even Einstein says the guy's on 
                         to something.

               His gaze up at the window breaks. He strolls around the room, 
               still smiling.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Science. Perception. Reality. 
                         Doubt...

               He stops to examine a bur on his fingernail.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Reasonable doubt. I'm sayin', 
                         sometimes, the more you look, the 
                         less you really know. It's a fact. A 
                         proved fact. In a way, it's the only 
                         fact there is. This heinie even wrote 
                         it out in numbers.

               He looks up at the private detective.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Burns?

               With a slight weight shift, Burns tips his chair so that its 
               front legs slap down onto the floor. He fishes a small 
               notebook from an inside pocket.

               His boredom is profound; his only concession to performance 
               is to move the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the 
               other where, perhaps, it will less inhibit speech.

                         to his service record.

               Burns looks at him sourly. He flips a couple of pages.

                                     BURNS
                         ...Inducted March 15, 1942, assigned

               Riedenschneider nods, smiling.

                         ...Thank you, Burns, get lost.

               Burns pockets his notebook, adjusts his hat, jams his hands 
               into his pockets, and ambles out of the room.

               The slam of the door leaves quiet.

               At length:

               Riedenschneider's fixed smile now fades.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER

                         a war hero, right? Island hopping, 
                         practically liberated the Pacific 
                         all by himself with a knife in one 
                         hand and a gun in the other and twenty 
                         yards of Jap guts between his teeth.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         And now it turns out this dope spent 
                         the war sitting on his ass in some 
                         boatyard in San Diego. You asked for 
                         blackmail, let me give you blackmail: 
                         Mr Hale-Fellow-Well-Met, about to 
                         open his own business here, has been 
                         lying to everybody in this town for 
                         the last four years, probably 
                         including half the people sitting on 
                         that jury. Well, it finally caught 
                         up with him--these dopes, it always 
                         does; someone threatened to spill 
                         it. Somebody knew his dirty little 
                         secret, just like your wife says. 
                         They called, they demanded money...

               He is looking at Doris.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Did Big Dave mention that it was 
                         something about his war service? I 
                         don't know, I wasn't there, *you'll* 
                         have to tell *us*. Maybe he specified, 
                         maybe he didn't; I'm not putting 
                         words in your mouth; the point is 
                         that this liar, this cynical 
                         manipulator, this man who through 
                         his lies sneered and belittled the 
                         sacrifice and heroism of all our 
                         boys who *did* serve and bleed and 
                         puke and die on foreign shores, and 
                         who made a fool out of this entire 
                         town, turns to *you* to help him out 
                         of his jam. Fat-assed sonofabitch!

                                     ED
                         So... who... who actually--

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Who? *Who?!* I don't know who! But 
                         the point is that if Mr Prosecutor 
                         over there had devoted half the time 
                         he's spent persecuting *this* woman 
                         to even the most cursory investigation 
                         of this schmoe's past, then we might 
                         *know* who! But we can't *know* what 
                         really happened! Because of Fritz, 
                         or Werner, or whatever the hell his 
                         name is! And because Me Prosecutor 
                         is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch 
                         who decided it's easier to victimize 
                         your wife! Because it's easier *not* 
                         to look! Because the more you look, 
                         the less you know! But the beauty of 
                         it is, we don't *gotta* know! We 
                         just gotta show that, goddamnit, 
                         *they* don't know. Reasonable doubt. 
                         Science. The atom. *You* explain it 
                         to me. Go ahead. Try.

               He chuckles as he heads for the door.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...Yeah, Freddy Riedenschneider sees 
                         daylight. We got a real shot at this, 
                         folks. Let's not get cocky.

               The door shuts behind him.

               Doris stares down at the table, as at the head of the scene.

               A silent beat; a smile starts to tug at the corners of her 
               mouth.

                                     ED
                         Honey...?

               The smile twitches, and then stays. Doris starts to laugh. 
               Ed frowns.

                                     ED
                         ...Honey?

               Her laughter builds, almost to hysteria. Finally it subsides 
               and, still staring at the tabletop and smiling, she shakes 
               her head:

                                     DORIS
                         What a dope.

               ABUNDAS LIVING ROOM

               Ed sits listening as Birdy plays. She talks, after a moment, 
               her eyes on the sheet music:

                                     BIRDY
                         He was deaf when he wrote this.

                                     ED
                         Who?

                                     BIRDY
                         Beethoven. He created it, and yet he 
                         never actually heard it. I suppose 
                         he heard it all in his head, somehow.

               Over her continued playing:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         So maybe Riedenschneider could get 
                         Doris off. Maybe it would all work 
                         out. And I thought--I hoped--that 
                         maybe there was a way out for me as 
                         well...

               A SIGN

               The cardboard sign on an easel says "COME ONE, COME ALL / 
               PETALUMA HIGH SCHOOL TALENT SHOW / WEDNESDAY APRIL 29, 1949, 
               8:00 P.M.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The girl had talent, anyone could 
                         see that. And *she* wasn't some fly-
                         by-nighter, she was just a good clean 
                         kid...

               SCHOOL GYMNASIUM

               A young man holding a saxophone is just leaving the makeshift 
               stage to a smattering of applause. Birdy walks out to the 
               baby grand that has been set out center stage.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...If she was going to have a career 
                         she'd need a responsible adult looking 
                         out for her...

               We track up the rows of folding chairs that have been set 
               out on the gym floor for the audience of students and parents, 
               many of whom fan themselves with programs. We come to rest 
               on Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...some kind of... manager. She'd 
                         have contracts to look at, be going 
                         on tours, playing on the radio maybe. 
                         I could help her sort through all of 
                         that, without charging her an arm 
                         and a leg, just enough to get by...

               Birdy begins to play for the quietly attentive audience.

               EXT. SCHOOL

               Ed is among the crowd streaming from the gym into the warm 
               summer night. He looks around the parking lot.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I could afford to charge less 
                         than the usual manager, not having 
                         to put up a big front like a lot of 
                         these phonies. And I could be with 
                         her, enough to keep myself feeling 
                         OK...

               A trace of a frown as he spots her leaning against a car, 
               laughing, passing a cigarette back and forth with another 
               student--a boy.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Why couldn't that work?... Why 
                         not?...

               Birdy's easy smile remains as Ed approaches, but the boy's 
               drops; he puts on a face more suitable for meeting adults.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hi, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy. I thought that was 
                         very good.

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, in there? I messed up a little 
                         bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody 
                         noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is 
                         Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr 
                         Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Tony.

                                     TONY
                         Hello, sir.

               Silence. The teens wait for the adult to direct the 
               conversation; Ed has nothing to say. At length, he clears 
               his throat.

                                     ED
                         ...Well, congratulations. I guess 
                         I'll be getting home.

                                     TONY
                         Nice to meet you, sir.

               TURANDOT SUITE

               It is morning. We are tracking past an unmade bed toward the 
               bathroom, where we hear water running.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Anyway, that's what I was thinking 
                         about in the days leading up to the 
                         trial. It seemed like once that was 
                         over, I'd be ready for a new start. 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider was very 
                         optimistic. He was busy preparing...

               We have rounded the open bathroom door to find Riedenschneider 
               hunched over the sink, toothbrush in hand, spitting out water. 
               He rises, looks at himself in the mirror, sprinkles some 
               tonic in his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And finally it came... the first 
                         day of the trial...

               Riedenschneider runs his fingers through his hair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...What Riedenschneider called the 
                         Big Show.

               He straightens his tie, gives his neck a twist.

               COURTROOM

               We are close on the back of Riedenschneider's gleaming hair. 
               He is sitting at the defense table.

               There is a murmur of a crowd that has yet to be called to 
               order.

                                     FRANK
                         Where's the judge? How come there's 
                         no judge?

               Ed and Frank sit next to each other in the first gallery row 
               directly behind Riedenschneider.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Where's the judge, Ed?

               Ed shrugs. Frank looks at Riedenschneider's back.

                                     FRANK
                         ...How come the judge doesn't come 
                         out?

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         The judge comes in last. He'll come 
                         in when Doris gets here.

                                     FRANK
                         So where's Doris? I thought we started 
                         at ten. Hey, Riedenschneider, where's 
                         Doris?

               Riedenschneider is curt:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         She's late.

                                     FRANK
                         Late? How can she be late?

               Riedenschneider doesn't answer; Frank turns to Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...She's in prison, Ed. None of *us* 
                         are in prison, and yet we're not 
                         late. We're on time, Ed. How can 
                         Doris be late? What, they don't have 
                         wake-up calls?

               The murmur of the crowd subsides as a door behind the judge's 
               bench opens and the judge hurriedly enters.

               The gallery rises but the judge quickly waves them back down 
               and, rather than seating himself, leans forward over his 
               desk to give a peremptory beckoning wave to Riedenschneider 
               and the prosecutor.

                                     JUDGE
                         Counselors.

               Riedenschneider, puzzled, approaches the bench, as does his 
               counterpart from the other table. The judge, still leaning 
               forward, speaks to them in a low voice that is not audible 
               from the gallery.

               The crowd has started murmuring again, also in hushed tones. 
               Frank leans in toward Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         What's going on, Ed? I thought there 
                         would be arguments. The bailiff, and 
                         so forth...

               Ed, also puzzled, is watching Riedenschneider, who suddenly 
               stiffens. As the judge continues to talk, Riedenschneider 
               looks back over his shoulder at Ed.

                                     FRANK
                         ...Ed, what is this? Is this 
                         procedure?

               The two lawyers nod at the judge and walk back to their 
               respective tables. The judge now summons a uniformed man 
               standing to one side.

                                     JUDGE
                         Bailiff.

               As the judge and the bailiff confer, Riedenschneider looks 
               down at his desk and, for something to do, straightens various 
               papers.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         I don't understand... We had a real 
                         shot at it... We could have won this 
                         thing...

               The Bailiff Announces:

                                     BAILIFF
                         In the matter of the State of 
                         California versus Doris Crane, Case 
                         Number 87249 assigned to this Superior 
                         Court...

               As the bailiff drones, Riedenschneider shakes his head.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...It doesn't make any sense...

               BARBERSHOP

               Late afternoon sun slants in.

               The shop, not open for business, is very still. Ed, in his 
               courtroom suit, sits in one of the vinyl chairs that line 
               the wall, hunched forward, forearms on his knees.

               Frank, also still in his suit, is up in one of the barber 
               chairs, one hand cupped to his forehead, weeping.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She'd hanged herself. I'd brought 
                         her a dress to wear to court and 
                         she'd used the belt. I didn't 
                         understand it either. At first I 
                         thought maybe it had something to do 
                         with me, that she'd figured out 
                         somehow how I fit into it and couldn't 
                         stand it, couldn't stand knowing...

               BEDROOM

               Night. Ed is in bed, staring at the ceiling.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That wasn't it, I would find out 
                         later. For now, everything just seemed 
                         ruined...

               METROPOLE LOBBY

               Riedenschneider is at the cashier's desk, checking out. Behind 
               him a bellman's cart is piled high with his bags.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Freddy Riedenschneider went back 
                         to Sacramento still shaking his head, 
                         saying it was the biggest 
                         disappointment of his professional 
                         career...

               FRANK'S HOUSE

               Day. Frank's kitchen.

               Frank sits at his kitchen table, staring, in a bathrobe thrown 
               over his pyjamas, unshaven.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Frankie fell to pieces. I suspect 
                         he was drinking; anyway, he stopped 
                         coming to work...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed, in his smock, works on a customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That left me to keep the place 
                         going, or the bank would've taken 
                         it.

               As he uses the electric clippers, a cigarette plumes between 
               his lips. He squints against the smoke drifting past his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...*I* was the principal barber now. 
                         I hired a new man for the second 
                         chair...

               Ed's former chair is indeed being manned by a newcomer, a 
               gangly young man who animatedly chats up his customer.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I'd hired the guy who did the 
                         least gabbing when he came in for an 
                         interview. But I guess the new man 
                         had only kept quiet because he was 
                         nervous; once he had the job, he 
                         talked from the minute I opened the 
                         shop in the morning...

               EXT. BARBERSHOP

               It is evening. Ed is locking the barbershop as, next to him 
               on the sidewalk, the new man continues to chat, gesticulating 
               to illustrate his store.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until I locked up at night. For 
                         all I know, he talked to himself on 
                         the way home.

               STREET

               Ed walks along the sidewalk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...When *I* walked home, it seemed 
                         like everyone avoided looking at 
                         me...

               Indeed, none of the passers-by establish eye contact; their 
               averted eyes make the crowd a faceless throng.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...as if I'd caught some disease. 
                         This thing with Doris, nobody wanted 
                         to talk about it; it was like I was 
                         a ghost walking down the street...

               HOUSE

               As Ed lets himself in.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And when I got home now, the place 
                         felt empty.

               He sits on the couch and, after a beat, takes a cigarette 
               pack from his pocket and taps out a smoke.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I sat in the house, but there was 
                         nobody there. I was a ghost; I didn't 
                         see anyone; no one saw me...

               BARBERSHOP

               Ed is in his smock again, operating the clippers.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was the barber.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               The drone of the clippers has continued over the black. A 
               voice fades up:

                                     VOICE 1
                         So two blocks later I look at the 
                         change she gave me and, golly, I'm 
                         two bits short.

                                     VOICE 2
                         Two bits short.

                                     VOICE 1
                         So I walk back over to Linton's, 
                         find this gal--big argument; she 
                         doesn't even recall the transaction.

                                     VOICE 2
                         No recollection.

                                     VOICE 1
                         Doesn't recall the transaction, no 
                         recollection, so I said, Look, dear...

               FADE IN

               We are looking at a magazine story. Its headline, over an 
               illustration of a cresting wave, is: WAVE OF THE FUTURE.

               Underneath are black-and-white photographs of heavy equipment 
               and racks of clothing on motorized tracks. Subheadlines read: 
               NEXT TO GODLINESS - Dry Cleaning Sweeps The Nation - The 
               Thoroughly Modern Way To Clean.

               Ed sits in one of the vinyl chairs, staring at Life magazine. 
               The offscreen conversation drones on as the new man works on 
               a customer.

                                     NEW MAN
                         ...go ahead, look at the menu, if 
                         you're in before six o'clock it's 
                         the, whatchamacallit, the--

                                     CUSTOMER
                         Early Bird Special.

                                     NEW MAN
                         What? Yeah, the Early Riser...

               Ed flips the pages of the magazine, and stops on a photograph 
               of a dark desert landscape with one bright light hovering in 
               the sky. The caption underneath: ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO.

                                     VOICE
                         Crane?

               Ed looks up.

               A man in a black suit and fedora has directed the question 
               at the new man, who looks up from his gabbling, momentarily 
               slackjawed.

                                     ED
                         ...I'm Crane.

                                     MAN
                         My name is Diedrickson. County medical 
                         examiner.

                                     ED
                         Yeah?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Just came for an informal chat...

               Diedrickson looks around uncomfortably.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Why don't I buy you a drink?

               Ed rises from his chair and, as he unbuttons his smock, 
               addresses the new man, who still gapes.

                                     ED
                         Dwight, you OK here for a few minutes?

                                     DWIGHT
                         Whuh--uh, yeah, sure Ed, take your 
                         time.

               BAR

               It is late afternoon, dusty and empty.

               Ed and Diedrickson sit on adjacent stools, Diedrickson cocking 
               his hat lower to its man-sitting-at-a-bar position.

               As the bartender approaches:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         Rye.

                                     ED
                         Just coffee.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         You sure you don't want something 
                         stiffer?

               Ed shrugs and shakes his head.

                                     BARTENDER
                         Coffee it is.

               He leaves. Diedrickson interlaces his fingers on the bartop 
               and stares at them. After a beat:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...County M. E. does an autopsy on 
                         anyone who dies in custody. I don't 
                         know if you knew that. It's routine.

               Ed doesn't answer. Diedrickson, after some more staring at 
               his hands, plows on:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Doesn't become a matter of public 
                         record unless there's foul play. 
                         However. I don't believe I'm 
                         *prohibited* from telling you this. 
                         I guess I'm not obliged to tell you, 
                         either. I don't exactly know.  But 
                         if *I* were the man, I'd want to be 
                         told.

                                     ED
                         Told what?

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         I, uh... thanks.

               The bartender has set down the drinks.

               Diedrickson waits for him to leave. He takes a hit from his 
               glass. Finally:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry to add to your burden, 
                         Crane, but I'd want to know it it 
                         was me. Your wife was pregnant. First 
                         trimester.

               A pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Well, there it is.

               Another pause.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry.

               He mutters to himself:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Hell, I hope I've done the right 
                         thing.

                                     ED
                         My wife and I had not... performed 
                         the sex act in many years.

               Diedrickson stiffens.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                              (murmuring)
                         ...Jesus.
                              (aloud)
                         ...Well, that's not really my 
                         business.

               He is hastily digging for money.

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...I'm sorry. Well, there it is.

               He leaves a couple of bills on the bar and mumbles as he 
               leaves:

                                     DIEDRICKSON
                         ...Good luck, Crane.

               His retreating footsteps echo down the bar.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               It is a dingy hallway lit by bare bulbs. Ed stands in the 
               middle background, knocking on a door.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Doris and I had never really talked 
                         much. I don't think that's a bad 
                         thing, necessarily. But it was funny: 
                         now I wanted to talk--now, with 
                         everyone gone. I was alone, with 
                         secrets I didn't want and no one to 
                         tell them to anyway.

               The door opens and Ed is admitted by the unseen tenant.

               APARTMENT

               We hear a low murmuring as we slowly pan the apartment. It 
               is overfurnished with heavy, ornate chairs, sideboards, chests 
               too big for the space and all going too seed. Surface areas 
               are covered with yellowing lacework or exotic brocades; the 
               one lamp has a veil thrown over it to further scrim down its 
               feeble light.

               Our pan brings us onto Ed seated at a small card table across 
               from a small elderly woman in a shawl who is the source of 
               the murmuring. Her eyes are squeezed shut in concentration 
               as she mumbles.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I visited a woman who was supposed 
                         to have powers in communicating with 
                         those who had passed across, as she 
                         called it. She said that people who 
                         passed across were picky about who 
                         they'd communicate with, not like 
                         most people you run into on this 
                         side...

               The woman opens her eyes and looks at Ed.

                                     WOMAN
                         Giff me your hant.

               Ed places his hand in the center of the table.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so you needed a guide who they 
                         didn't mind talking to, someone with 
                         a gift for talking to souls...

               Ed looks at the woman's spotted and vein-lined hand as it 
               rests upon his. Her mumbling resumes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, first she told me that my 
                         wife was in a peaceful place, that 
                         our souls were still connected by 
                         some spiritual bond, that she had 
                         never stopped loving me even though 
                         she'd done some things she wasn't 
                         proud of...

               Ed looks up at the old woman.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...She was reading me like a book.

               She is stealing a glance at Ed to check his reaction.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then she started talking about 
                         'Dolores' this and 'Dolores' that 
                         and was there anything I wanted to 
                         tell 'Dolores,' and I knew I'd just 
                         be telling it to the old bat. And 
                         even if somehow Doris could hear, it 
                         wouldn't be on account of this so-
                         called medium.

               APARTMENT HALLWAY

               Ed is leaving.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         She was a phony. Just another gabber.

               EXT. TENEMENT

               Ed emerges from the building.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I was turning into Ann Nirdlinger, 
                         Big Dave's wife. I had to turn my 
                         back on the old lady, on the veils, 
                         on the ghosts, on the dead, before 
                         they all sucked me in...

               Ed disappears into the night.

               ABUNDAS HOUSE

               It is night. We are looking through the screen door. Walter 
               Abundas sits in yellow lamplight by a small table on the 
               side of the staircase, over which papers are strewn. He is 
               murmuring into the telephone as he examines the papers, 
               glasses halfway down his nose, a drink in one hand.

               Ed's hand enters to rap on the door. Walter looks up, sets 
               the phone down and comes to the door.

                                     WALTER
                         Ed, how're you holding up?

                                     ED
                         I'm OK, Walter, thanks.

               Walter opens the door to him.

                                     WALTER
                         I'm so damn sorry about your loss. 
                         Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     WALTER
                         Birdy's in the parlor--I'm on long 
                         distance here.

                                     ED
                         Sure, Walter. Thanks.

               PARLOR

               Birdy also has papers spread across a table in front of her: 
               homework. She looks up at Ed's entrance.

                                     BIRDY
                         Hello, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Hello, Birdy.

                                     BIRDY
                         We haven't seen you since... I'm 
                         terribly sorry.

               Ed sits across from her.

                                     ED
                         Yeah.

                                     BIRDY
                         We've certainly missed you.

                                     ED
                         Birdy, I've been doing a lot of 
                         thinking. There are a lot of things 
                         that haven't worked out for me. Life 
                         has dealt me some bum cards...

               He is loading a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...or maybe I just haven't played 
                         'em right, I don't know. But you're--

                                     BIRDY
                         Pop doesn't like people smoking in 
                         here.

               Ed stares. This takes a moment to register.

                                     ED
                         Oh. Sorry.

               Birdy lowers her voice:

                                     BIRDY
                         Sometimes I have a cigarette in here 
                         when he's away. Never when he's in 
                         the house. He can smell it a mile 
                         off.

               Ed is pocketing the cigarette.

                                     ED
                         Sure... Sure, it's his house.

                                     BIRDY
                         That's what he keeps telling me.

               Ed smiles thinly.

                                     ED
                         Anyway, uh... my point is you're 
                         young. A kid really, your whole life 
                         ahead of you. But it's not too soon 
                         to start thinking... to start making 
                         opportunities for yourself. Before 
                         it all washes away.

                                     BIRDY
                         Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so 
                         too. I work pretty hard at school.

                                     ED
                         That's swell. However, the music, if 
                         you want to pursue it, well, the 
                         lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only 
                         take you so far. There's this guy in 
                         San Francisco, I've made inquiries, 
                         everybody says he's the best. Trained 
                         lots of people who've gone on to 
                         have big concert careers, symphony 
                         orchestras, the works. His name is 
                         Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure 
                         I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, 
                         he's a Frenchman.

                                     BIRDY
                         Boy.

                                     ED
                         You've got talent, anyone could see 
                         that. And he's the best. If he thinks 
                         a student has talent, he'll take 'em 
                         on for next to nothing. You're a 
                         cinch to be accepted, I could cover 
                         the cost of the lessons, like I said, 
                         it's pretty modest--

                                     BIRDY
                         Oh, Mr Crane--

                                     ED
                         I have to do it. I can't stand by 
                         and watch more things go down the 
                         drain. You're young, you don't 
                         understand.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't 
                         really thought about a career or 
                         stuff.

                                     ED
                         I know you haven't. Look, just go 
                         meet him as a favor to me. I talked 
                         to this guy. Hope I pronounced his 
                         name right. He sounded very busy, 
                         but he's not a bad egg; he loosened 
                         up a little when I told him how 
                         talented you are. He agreed to see 
                         you this Saturday. He said maybe you 
                         were a diamond in the rough. His 
                         words.

                                     BIRDY
                         Geez, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         Just see him, as a favor to me.

               STUDIO WAITING ROOM

               It is a small square room with straightbacked chairs set 
               against the walls. At the far end of the room a door leads 
               to a studio from which piano music dully emanates; it is a 
               fast and difficult piece of music.

               Ed sits waiting. He is the only adult; two or three youngsters 
               of different ages sit apparently waiting for their lessons.

               Ed looks at one of the waiting boys in a white shirt and bow 
               tie. He is perhaps eleven. His hair is greased back in a 
               Junior Contour.

               Another boy, in a cardigan sweater, sports a Butch.

               The piano piece is ending. There is the murmur of voices. 
               Dull footsteps.

               The studio door swings open.

               A small man in a rumpled black suit smudged with cigarette 
               ash is bowing Birdy out the door. He has a goatee and a 
               knotted foulard. His eyes flit over the waiting room and 
               settle on Ed.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...You are ze fahzer?

                                     ED
                         No. Uh... family friend.

                                     MAN
                         I am Carcanogues.

               He smiles at Birdy.

                                     MAN
                         ...You wait, my dear?

                                     BIRDY
                         Sure, Mr K.

               A jerk of Carcanogues' head bids Ed rise.

               STUDIO

               Ed enters, uncomfortable. He looks around, taking in the 
               high-ceilinged space, which is dominated by a grand piano.

               Carcanogues has followed him and now runs water from a tap.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         I speak to you on ze phone, non? You 
                         have a special interest in music?

                                     ED
                         Uh-huh.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah yes, a music lover.

                                     ED
                         Well, I don't pretend to be an expert.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah.

               He uncaps a small bottle of pills, shakes two into his palm, 
               tosses them back and washes them down.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Ah-hah.

               He twists a cigarette into a long holder, sticks it in his 
               mouth and lights it.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...Mm.

                                     ED
                         Well? How'd she do?

               This elicits a Gallic frown of consideration.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ze girl?... She seems like a very 
                         nice girl. She *plays*, monsieur, 
                         like a very nice girl. Ztinks. Very 
                         nice girl. However, ztinks.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Is not so hard to understand. Her 
                         playing, very polite.

                                     ED
                         Did she make mistakes?

               Another gallic moue:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she 
                         plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the 
                         right note, always. Very proper.

                                     ED
                         I don't understand, no mistakes, 
                         she's just a kid--I thought you taught 
                         the, uh, the--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Ah, but that is just what I cannot 
                         teach. I cannot teach her to have a 
                         soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, 
                         is not about the fingers. *Done* 
                         with the fingers, yes. But the music, 
                         she is inside. Inside, monsieur...

               A two-handed gesture, indicating his heart.

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...The music start here...

               He waggles his fingers:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...come out through here; then, 
                         maybe...

               His wave takes in the heavens:

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         ...she can go up there.

                                     ED
                         Well, look, I don't claim to be an 
                         expert--

                                     CARCANOGUES
                         Then you listen to me, for I am 
                         expert. That girl, she give me a 
                         headache. She cannot play. Nice girl. 
                         Very clever hands. Nice girl. Someday, 
                         I think, maybe, she make a very good 
                         typist.

               DRIVING

               We are driving through the rural countryside of northern 
               California. It is a two-lane road with little traffic. Sun 
               strobes the car through the passing trees.

               Ed drives, glaring. Birdy, next to him, seems unperturbed, 
               ever cheerful.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I stank, didn't I?

                                     ED
                         He didn't say that.

                                     BIRDY
                         But more or less.

                                     ED
                         Look, I'm no expert, but--

                                     BIRDY
                         It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.

                                     ED
                         I'm sure there's a dozen teachers 
                         better than this clown. More 
                         qualified. Goddamn phony.

                                     BIRDY
                         But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm 
                         not interested in playing music 
                         professionally.

               Ed looks at her.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I'm not certain I'll have a career 
                         at all, and if I do, I'll probably 
                         be a veterinarian.

                                     ED
                         ...Uh-huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         I do appreciate the interest you've 
                         taken, though.

                                     ED
                         Ah... it's nothing.

                                     BIRDY
                         I'm only sorry that I didn't play 
                         better for you. I know it would've 
                         made you happy. You know what you 
                         are?

                                     ED
                         Huh.

                                     BIRDY
                         You're an enthusiast.

                                     ED
                         Huh. Yeah. Maybe...

               He loads a cigarette into his mouth.

                                     ED
                         ...I guess I've been all wet.

                                     BIRDY
                         But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...

               She reaches over to touch his thigh.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I wanted to make you happy.

                                     ED
                         Birdy--

                                     BIRDY
                         It's OK...

               She is leaning over his lap.

                                     BIRDY
                         ...I want to do it, Mr Crane.

               Ed is shocked:

                                     ED
                         Birdy!

               He reaches awkwardly, wanting to push her away but not wanting 
               to be violent.

                                     ED
                         ...No, please.

                                     BIRDY
                         Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--

               The blare of an oncoming horn.

               Ed looks up, one hand struggling with Birdy, the other on 
               the wheel.

               The oncoming car.

               Ed swerves, tires screech into a skid, Birdy screams.

               CRASH: the car hits a roadside tree.

               BLACK.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         Time slows down right before an 
                         accident, and I had time to think 
                         about things. I thought about what 
                         an undertaker had told me once--that 
                         your hair keeps growing, for a while 
                         anyway, after you die...

               A hubcap is skipping in slow motion along the road and then 
               off the road, down an embankment.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and then it stops. I thought, 
                         what keeps it growing? Is it like a 
                         plant in soil? What goes out of the 
                         soil? The soul? And when does the 
                         hair realize that it's gone?

               We are high, looking down at Ed, who is motionless, head 
               resting on the steering wheel of the stopped car. We boom 
               down toward his, slowly rotating as we move in. As we move 
               we lose focus; Ed becomes more and more blurry.

               The blurry shape is now slowly spinning away from us, a bright 
               revolving disc spinning up into the darkness until it 
               disappears, leaving only black.

               FADE IN

               Ed sits on the front porch of his bungalow, smoking a 
               cigarette in the late afternoon light.

               A dog barks next door; a distant screen door slams; children 
               are playing somewhere up the street.

               Ed looks down at his watch. It is 5:30.

               Something attracts his attention: at the foot of his driveway 
               stands a man in a cream-colored suit and hat. He is a small 
               figure, perfectly still, staring at the gravel driveway.

               After a beat he lifts up a small clipboard, squints at the 
               house, and jots something down.

               He finishes writing, screws the lid back onto his pen, and 
               is sticking it into a breast pocket when he realizes he is 
               being watched. His manner instantly warms.

                                     MAN
                         Hello!

                                     ED
                         Hello.

               The man starts up the walk.

                                     MAN
                         I notice you still have peastone in 
                         your driveway.

               Yeah.

                                     MAN
                         Well, of course, you don't have to 
                         rejuvenate that once every couple of 
                         years, don't you, when the peastone 
                         thins out.

               Ed shrugs.

                                     MAN
                         ...Where does it go, huh? Like the 
                         odd sock. But you *know* where it 
                         goes--you probably pick pieces of it 
                         off your lawn all the time, churn it 
                         up with your lawn mower, sweep it 
                         off the walk here--pain in the neck.

               Ed shrugs again.

                                     ED
                         Doesn't bother me.

                                     MAN
                         Well, have you ever considered tar 
                         Macadam? People think it's just for 
                         public works and commercial purposes, 
                         roads, parking lots, so forth...

               A car pulls into the drive.

                                     MAN
                         ...but we have the technology now to 
                         bring it to the homeowner, the 
                         individual consumer, at a very 
                         reasonable price.

               Doris emerges from the car.

                                     MAN
                         ...Mind if I show you the 
                         specifications?--Evening, ma'am.

               Doris gives him a hard look.

                                     DORIS
                         What're *you* selling?

               The man gives a practiced laugh.

                                     MAN
                         Well, ma'am, I was just telling your 
                         husband here about tar Macadam, for 
                         your home driveway here--these are 
                         the specs...

               Doris takes the brochure he has pulled from a small case.

                                     MAN
                         ...It's the modern way to--

               Doris tears the brochure in half and hands it back.

                                     DORIS
                         Get lost.

               The man gazes at her. His smile fades fast and he and Doris 
               stare at each other, two hard cases.

               He turns stiffly and stalks off.

               Once his gaze has broken, Doris turns as well. She stalks up 
               the stairs to the porch and bangs through the screen front 
               door of the house, letting it slam behind her.

               Quiet, early evening.

               Ed sits, smoking.

               At length he rises and goes in to the house.

               INT. BUNGALOW

               It is dim, no lights on yet. We hear banging and clomping 
               from the kitchen.

               Doris emerges with a clinking sound, chasing ice cubes around 
               a drink with a swizzle stick. Her face is still hard-set.

               With a groan of its old upholstery springs she sits onto the 
               couch.

               Ed sits as well. He draws on his cigarette, drags an ashtray 
               closer on the coffee table.

               She sips. He puffs.

                                     ED
                         ...Doris--

                                     DORIS
                         Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.

               The sit. The light is failing. The clink of ice cubes.

                                                                   FADE OUT

               In the black we hear machine noise of indistinct origin. As 
               the noise becomes more defined we also hear shouting, faint, 
               distant:

                                     VOICE
                         Are you there? Are you awake?

               A blurry white disc is fading up. As it focuses it resolves 
               into the reflector worn by a white-robed doctor, leaning in 
               close.

               He leans away, murmuring:

                                     DOCTOR
                         He's coming around. Can you talk, 
                         sir? These men have to talk.

               Ed is lying in a hospital bed. His face is bandaged and one 
               side is grotesquely swollen. The machine noise is life 
               support.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...Sir? Are you awake? He's awake.

               Two police officers, Persky and Krebs, lean in.

                                     PERSKY
                         Are you awake?... Is he awake?

                                     KREBS
                         Crane? We have to tell you, as soon 
                         as you're conscious--is he conscious?

                                     PERSKY
                         His eyes are open.

                                     KREBS
                         Uh... you're under arrest.

                                     PERSKY
                         As soon as the doctor lets us, we 
                         gotta move you. Does he understand 
                         that? We're supposed to tell him. 
                         Are you conscious?

                                     KREBS
                         You'll go to the prison hospital.

                                     PERSKY
                         Under arrest for murder.

               Ed's speech is thickened by injuries and anesthesia:

                                     ED
                         Birdy... I didn't mean to--

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say?

                                     ED
                         Birdy...

                                     DOCTOR
                         Birdy. The girl. No, the girl's OK. 
                         Broken clavicle.

               The doctor leans in.

                                     DOCTOR
                         ...That's the collarbone, Crane. 
                         Broken. She's OK though.

                                     KREBS
                         So he understands? He's under arrest 
                         for murder?

                                     ED
                         Big Dave.

                                     PERSKY
                         Huh?

                                     KREBS
                         What'd he say? Does he understand?

                                     PERSKY
                         He said OK. Is that what he said?

               Krebs raises his voice:

                                     KREBS
                         You're under arrest for the murder 
                         of Creighton Tolliver! Do you 
                         understand?

               The voices are fading away:

                                     PERSKY
                         ...Does he understand?...

                                                                   FADE OUT

               UNDERWATER

               Light glimmers in water. We are drifting down, down, down.

               We bring in languidly waving arms--the arms of a child, waving 
               to keep himself submerged. It is a ten-year-old boy staring, 
               wide-eyed, at something in front of him. Bubbles 
               intermittently stream from his open mouth.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         The pansy. A kid diving at a waterhole 
                         outside of town had found his car...

               The reverse shows the car, also submerged, with Creighton 
               Tolliver inside, also wide-eyed, his hairpiece attached at 
               only one corner, the rest of it waving free.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They'd winched it out...

               TRACKING

               We are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated 
               men. The men rise.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and found he'd been beaten, just 
                         like Big Dave said--beaten to death...

               We arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small 
               door behind his raised bench.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Inside the briefcase were the 
                         partnership papers I'd signed...

               The judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on 
               the jury, now reseating itself.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...showing that I'd given him ten 
                         grand. For the district attorney...

               In response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney 
               rises to read the charge. His voice plays distantly, muted, 
               the words not discernible under the continuing voice-over.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...that made it fall into place: I'd 
                         gotten Doris to steal the money, the 
                         pansy had gotten wise somehow, and 
                         I'd had to kill him to cover my 
                         tracks. I was in a spot. I called in 
                         Freddy Riedenschneider...

               Riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. As he 
               listens to the charge:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...and signed the house over to him. 
                         He said he didn't ordinarily work 
                         that cheap, but he figured he owed 
                         me something since the last one hadn't 
                         played out...

               The drone of the D.A. has ended and Riedenschneider's echoing 
               voice drops into the hole:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Not guilty, your honor...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         I tried to tell him the whole story, 
                         but Riedenschneider stopped me. He 
                         said the story made his head hurt, 
                         and anyway he didn't see any way of 
                         using it without putting me on the 
                         hot seat for the murder of Big Dave...

               Riedenschneider claps Ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he 
               sits next to him. Ed still wears a cast on one arm and one 
               leg.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told me not to worry, though, 
                         said he'd think of something, Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.

               JAIL

               We are tracking in on Ed, lying on the bunk in his cell.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...They put me on twenty-four-hour 
                         deathwatch...

               A reverse track shows a guard on a tilted-back straightbacked 
               chair, outside the cell door, staring at Ed.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so that I couldn't Cheat Justice 
                         like they said my wife had done...

               COURTROOM

               The district attorney is rising again, this time to address 
               the jury.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But in front of the jury they had 
                         it that Doris was a saint; the whole 
                         plan had been mine, I was a Svengali 
                         who'd forced Doris to join my criminal 
                         enterprise...

               The district attorney is pointing at Ed.

                                     DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                         ...cynically used his own wife as a 
                         cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical 
                         cunning...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         On and on it went, how I'd used Doris 
                         and then let her take the fall. That 
                         stuff smarted because some of it was 
                         close to being true...

               The district attorney seats himself. The jury's eyes turn to 
               Freddy Riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of 
               him, either digesting the D.A.'s opening statement, or seeking 
               inspiration for his own.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And then it was Freddy 
                         Riedenschneider's turn.

               Riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I gotta hand it to him, he tossed 
                         a lot of sand in their eyes. He talked 
                         about how I'd lost my place in the 
                         universe...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...a puny player on the great world's 
                         stage...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...how I was too ordinary to be the 
                         criminal mastermind the D.A. made me 
                         out to be, how there was some greater 
                         scheme at work that the state had 
                         yet to unravel, and he threw in some 
                         of the old truth stuff he hadn't had 
                         a chance to trot out for Doris...

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...who among us is in a position to 
                         say...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He told them to look at me--look 
                         at me close. That the closer they 
                         looked the less sense it would all 
                         make, that I wasn't the kind of guy 
                         to kill a guy, that I was the barber, 
                         for Christ's sake...

               We pan the jury, solemnly listening to Riedenschneider.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I was just like them, an ordinary 
                         man, guilty of living in a world 
                         that had no place for me, guilty of 
                         wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, 
                         but not of murder...

               Riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground 
               to point a finger directly at Ed's face.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...He said I *was* Modern Man, and 
                         if they voted to convict me, well, 
                         they'd be practically cinching the 
                         noose around their own necks. He 
                         told them to look not at the facts 
                         but at the meaning of the facts, and 
                         then he said the facts *had* no 
                         meaning. It was a pretty good speech, 
                         and even had me going...

               A tap on the shoulder turns Ed around.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...until Frankie interrupted it.

               Frank socks Ed, sending him clattering to the floor.

               A bailiff immediately restrains him, but Frank looms over 
               Ed, bellowing through tears:

                                     FRANK
                         What kind of man *are* you? What 
                         kind of man *are* you?

               Riedenschneider interposes his body between Frank's and Ed's, 
               loudly protesting:

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         Move for a mistrial, your honor! 
                         Move for a mistrial! This outrageous 
                         display cannot help but prejudice...

               Ed moves to get up, but Riedenschneider, with a sidelong 
               glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the 
               floor.

                                     RIEDENSCHNEIDER
                         ...and inflame the passions of these 
                         twelve fine men and women...

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, he got his mistrial, but 
                         the well had run dry. There was 
                         nothing left to mortgage; 
                         Riedenschneider went home and the 
                         court appointed Lloyd Garroway...

               Ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman 
               who enters the plea in the new trial:

                                     GARROWAY
                         Your honor, we plead guilty, with 
                         extenuating circumstances.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...who threw me on the mercy of the 
                         court. It was my only chance, he 
                         said. I guess that meant I never had 
                         a chance...

               The judge starts droning the sentence:

                                     JUDGE
                         ...a menace to society... a predator 
                         on his own wife, his business 
                         associates, on an innocent young 
                         girl... social contract... line 
                         crossed... the offender forfeits the 
                         right to his own life... I hereby 
                         order that you be taken to a place 
                         of confinement...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               We are tracking down the hall.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         He wasn't buying any of that Modern 
                         Man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, 
                         or any of the mercy stuff either. 
                         No, he was going by the book, and 
                         the book said I got the chair...

               Ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, 
               hands clasped behind his head.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...so here I am. At first I didn't 
                         know how I got here. I knew step by 
                         step of course, which is what I've 
                         told you, step by step; but I couldn't 
                         see any pattern...

               LATER

               Ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Now that I'm near the end, I'm 
                         glad that this men's magazine paid 
                         me to tell my story. Writing it has 
                         helped me sort it all out. They're 
                         paying five cents a word, so you'll 
                         pardon me if sometimes I've told you 
                         more than you wanted to know...

               Recent issues of the magazine, Gent, and its sister 
               publication Nugget lie on the little desk. Their lurid covers 
               depict feature stories like I WAS ABDUCTED BY ALIENS and 
               AFTER TEN YEARS OF NORMAL LIFE, I DISCOVER I AM AN ESCAPED 
               LUNATIC.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But now, all the disconnected 
                         things seems to hook up.

               Ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his 
               eyes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...That's the funny thing about going 
                         away, knowing the date you're gonna 
                         die--and the men's magazine wanted 
                         me to tell how that felt...

               We hear a pulsing treble hum. Ed opens his eyes.

               The door to his cell is open.

               He rises and goes through the door.

               PRISON HALLWAY

               Ed, alone, walks down the hallway. The pulsing treble hum is 
               louder.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Well, it's like pulling away from 
                         the maze. While you're in the maze 
                         you go through willy-nilly, turning 
                         where you think you have to turn, 
                         banging into dead ends, one thing 
                         after another...

               PRISON YARD

               Ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone 
               walls. A hard spotlight shines down from above. Ed squints 
               into it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But get some distance on it, and 
                         all those twists and turns, why, 
                         they're the shape of your life. It's 
                         hard to explain...

               The spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer. We see its 
               revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of 
               its top bubble.

               After spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the 
               tremolo hum with it.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...But seeing it whole gives you 
                         some peace.

               Ed turns and re-enters the prison.

               ED'S CELL

               Ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind 
               his head. A hand enters to shake him awake.

               Three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing 
               a surplice and holding a bible.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...The men's magazine also asked 
                         about remorse. Yeah, I guess I'm 
                         sorry about the pain I caused other 
                         people...

               PRISON HALLWAY

               He is walking the last mile.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...but I don't regret anything. Not 
                         a thing. I used to. I used to regret 
                         being the barber.

               A door at the end opens:

               An electric chair. Straps open, and waiting:

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I dont know where I'm being taken.

               Ed is placed in the chair.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...I don't know what waits for me, 
                         beyond the earth and sky. But I'm 
                         not afraid to go.

               A man stoops at his feet. He has a bucket of water and a 
               straight razor.

               He waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch 
               of Ed's calf.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe the things I don't understand 
                         will be clearer there, like when a 
                         fog blows away...

               Ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the 
               bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating 
               hairs.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...Maybe Doris will be there.

               They are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...And maybe there I can tell her...

               The men withdraw.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...all those things...

               A thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch. 
               As he reaches for the switch, Ed looks up into the light.

                                     ED (V.O.)
                         ...they don't have words for here.

          NOTE

          Most of the sequences in this production are filmed using a hand-
          held camera or a Steadycam. These very mobile cameras move around
          the set, and get constantly closer and further from the
          characters. Still, we'll be using the usual technical terms, such
          as «long shot» or «full shot» or «medium shot» here and there to
          give the reader an idea of the location of the camera at the
          beginning of each sequence. And then we'll mention the movements
          of the camera.

          While the camera is flying over New-York, we keep on hearing the
          jazz music.
                         
          The camera reaches a round building that looks like a stadium and
          starts moving around the building.

                         
          HOCKEY GAME - INTERIOR NIGHT

          Long shot on the skating rink. A hockey game is in progress on the
          rink. The camera follows a player, and then pans on the audience.
                         
          The camera stops on a medium shot of Larry and Carol, a couple in
          their early fifties. Larry seems fascinated by the game, but Carol
          seems to find it boring. She looks at the ceiling, and then puts
          her hand over her mouth to suppress a yawn. Larry turns toward
          her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on.
                         
                          CAROL
           What?
                         
                          LARRY
           You promised to sit through the entire hockey game without
           being bored and I'll sit through the Wagner opera with you
           next week.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, honey, I promised. I know.
                         
                          LARRY
           I already bought the earplugs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Well, with your eyesight, I'm surprised you can see
           the puck.
                         
          The crowd starts yelling and we guess that one of the players has
          done something really good. Carol mockingly claps her hands.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yay, hooray.
                         
          Then she raises her eyes to the ceiling, seeming more bored than
          ever.
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A nice-looking apartment building in New-York.
                         
          Full shot of the lobby. We see the street through the glass door.
          An uniformed attendant is standing near a counter, on which he is
          writing on a book.
                         
          Larry and Carol are coming from the street and entering the
          building. He is carrying some shopping bags, and she is reading a
          newspaper, the «Daily News».
                         
                          LARRY
           God. I can't wait to get into bed and stretch out.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
          The attendant slightly turns around and bows to them. They bow
          back to him. He goes back to his book-keeping, and the couple
          keeps on walking through the lobby.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, there's a Bob Hope movie on television later.
                         
                          CAROL
           know. Can you believe this guy in Indiana ? Killed twelve
           victims, dismembered them and ate them.
                         
                          LARRY
           Really ? Well, it's an alternative lifestyle.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, I'll say.
                         
          They reach the two elevators. Larry presses the call-button on the
          wall between the two elevators.
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot inside the cabin of the elevator. The inner door
          slides open. Carol enters first, still reading her newspaper.
          Larry enters behind her and presses a button on the control panel.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           I'm coming.
                         
          Hearing people's voices, Larry puts his hand on the edge of the
          door to keep it from closing.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Hold the elevator.
                         
          Paul and Lilian enter the elevator. They are a middle-aged couple.
          He is bald and tall, and very smily. She is small, with grey hair.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           That's right.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you.
                         
          Lilian has a broad smile when she recognizes Larry and Carol. The
          elevator door slides shut. Lilian looks at Carol.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           I, uh, I see you at the gym sometimes.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, you do ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Yeah, we live in the apartment down the hall.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, I go whenever I have the discipline.
                          LILLIAN
           It's important to put that time in. It does wonders.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh god, yeah. I agree with you.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Exercising changed my life.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, geez...
                         
                          LARRY
           I prefer to atrophy. I'm not a very exercise person.
                         
                          PAUL
           We bought a treadmill last week.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, we had one. But you know, we got rid of it
           because it was just taking up too much space.
                          LILLIAN
           Oh, it-it-it...
                         
                          LARRY
           Because you have to turn it on and get on it once in a
           while. That was her problem.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Hey, I... exactly, I... and it's so confusing, with all
           those buttons and computerized programs. I'm just never
           gonna get that.
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of a very sober and modern hallway. Creme-colored walls,
          grey carpeting, dark wooden doors.
                         
          We hear the elevator door opening and Carol comes out, followed by
          Lilian, Larry and Paul. They all talk together and we can hardly
          understand the following dialogue.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I know. It's late.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           It's so wonderful, meeting.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           It is just like New York. You have neighbors. You never
           meet them... You guys...
                         
          The following line, said by Lilian, is clearer and we understand
          it better.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           ... I've seen you so many times in the hallway, you know...
           and I've always wanted to come up and say hallo.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, anyway... good night.
                         
          Larry and Carol walk away from Lilian and Paul, who remain near
          the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Good night. Such a lovely couple. You know that...
                         
          Paul bends down to pick up something on the carpet. Lilian walks
          one step in Larry's direction.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Oh, uh, say, hello ?
                         
          Paul starts opening his apartment door, just across the hallway
          from the elevator.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Huh ? Yeah ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Huh, listen... why don't you come in for a-a-a second and
           have a drink with us ? I mean, we'd really love that.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Larry and Carol. Larry makes a
          negative sign with his hand.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, oh well that'd be fine...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           She makes great Irish coffee.
                         
          Mute conversation between Carol and Larry. Larry evidently doesn't
          want to accept Lilian's invitation, but Carol wants to.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Oh, please ? Uh uh, I want you to give me a treadmill
           lesson.
                         
                          LARRY
           There's a movie on television I want to watch.
                         
          Carol starts walking toward Lilian and Paul's apartment, followed
          reluctantly by Larry.
                         
          The camera pans around during Carol's next line, and we see Carol
          entering Lilian an Paul's apartment.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, about the tread... oh, well, if I can figure it out,
           then believe me, anybody can.
                         
          She laughs, and Larry, entering the apartment behind her, utters a
          forced laugh.
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The cosy apartment of middle upper-class people. The decoration
          looks like them.
                         
          Medium shot of Lilian walking across the bedroom toward the large
          double bed. She walks near the famous treadmill.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Have a look at the instructions. They drive me crazy. You
           know ? I don't know what I'm doing at all. Let's look...
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           No. Please, it's easy.
                         
          Lilian picks up a book on a table near the bed.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Wonderful book they've given me. Now I'm at level five.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           What ?
                          LILLIAN
           That I know.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           You're that advanced ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Well, yeah.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           God, I only got to level two.
                         
          Lilian brings the book to Carol.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Look at these diagrams. Do you believe this ?
                         
                          CAROL
           That's amazing.
                         
          She is standing near the treadmill. Lilian shows her one of the
          diagram in the book.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           I can't understand this even.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me see.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Yeah, well. See this ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay.
                         
          PAUL'S APPARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          One of the wall could be a bay window, but, for the moment, it is
          entirely covered by a beige drape.
                         
          Medium shot of Paul bringing a stamp book to Larry.
                         
                          PAUL
           Now, let me show you a mint 1933 airmail. Very rare... and
           very beautiful.
                         
          Larry is seated near a small table, on which Paul puts the book
          down. Paul sits down next to Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
          Paul picks up a special philatelist magnifying glass and puts it
          in front of the stamp, for Larry to have a better look at it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look at that. And this plate block is quite unique because
           it has a flaw in the engraving. See if you can see it.
          Larry, who is not interested in philately at all, scratches his
          head.
                          LARRY
           Uh, it's hard for me.
                         
                          PAUL
           Actually I'll give you a little hint. Right down here in
           the corner.
                         
                          LARRY
           That tiny thing there ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Interesting, yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ah, you have a really...
                         
                          PAUL
           That makes it quite valuable, you see. And I just got a
           commemorative set of issues that are going to be quite
           valuable, too.
                         
          He picks up a transparent envelope inside which are several
          stamps.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes.
                         
                          PAUL
           Look at the color, right there. All these are gonna become
           a real f...
                         
          Larry stands up.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, listen... we're probably keeping you up, right ?
                          PAUL
           Oh, no-no-no. This is wonderful.
                         
                          LARRY
           I should be going.
                         
                          PAUL
           What do you do, if I may ask ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Me ? I'm in book publishing. I work up at Harper's.
                         
                          PAUL
           Are you really ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           I own an old, uh, cinema. Having it redone.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh.
                         
                          PAUL
           Used to have a string of three, but, you know, business is
           not what it used to be.
                         
          He picks up some more stamps from the table.
                         
                          PAUL
           Now, look at these presidentials. Look at the color work.
           Even the perforations are still intact.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where's Carol ?
                         
                          PAUL
           All the...
                         
                          LARRY
           Because I should really be going, actually.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, really ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. I mean, so, we...
                         
          In the background, behind Larry, we see Carol and Lilian entering
          the room.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Coffee's ready !
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, coffee. I forgot coffee.
                         
          He turns around to face the women.
           PAUL (voice over)
           Good. We can get back to this later. Come on in.
                         
          We see Paul's hand on Larry's shoulder, pushing him toward the
          centre of the room.
                         
          A little later.
                         
          Full shot of the room. They are all seated around a low table,
          Larry and Carol on the sofa, Paul and Lilian on two armchairs.
          They've just finished their coffee.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Well, we've never had any children, but it's easy to
           empathize. Oh, um, uh, what college does your son attend ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Brown.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Oh.
                          PAUL
           Nice color.
                         
          They all laugh.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Paul never attended college. He's self-made.
                         
                          PAUL
           Always regretted it. I think knowledge is the second most
           important thing. First is health, then knowledge, then
           money.
                         
          Larry puts his cup down on the low table.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, it's amazing how time, we,... we'll just...
                         
                          LILLIAN
           And, do you work ?
                         
          Larry stands up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Huh ? Do I ?
                         
                          LILLIAN
           Yes.
                         
          Larry looks at Carol and sits back on the sofa.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, I actually, um, I used to work at an ad agency,
           but that was many years ago.
                         
          The camera moves closer to Carol and Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           But... You know, I've been seriously thinking of starting a
           little restaurant. But, well, Larry, he's trying to talk me
           out of it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, she's a great cook, though, really. Her duck and fennel
           omelette on a bed of scallops and Hollandaise sauce with
           truffles and sweetbreads'll make you snap into a fetal
           position and have you in bed screaming for a month.
                         
                          CAROL
           He loves to tease me, but actually, he really loves exotic
           food.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           My weakness is any rich dessert, cream, butter, anything
           with fat.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, really ? Oh well, let... listen... I'll fix you a
           dessert that'll make your eyeballs roll up. You'll have to
           exercise for a month to work it off.
                          LILLIAN
           Yeah.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           We're going to Le Cirque for our anniversary.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, really ?
                         
          The camera moves around, away from Larry and Carol, to Paul.
                         
           LILLIAN (voice over)
           Yes. Twenty-eight years. November.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Really ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, what do you buy the woman who buys everything ?
                         
          The camera moves around backward, away from Paul and back to Larry
          and Carol.
                         
                          LILLIAN
           We already have twin cemetery plots.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, it's... I always think a Bentley is in good taste.
           You know, or you can go the route that I went with her. On
           her twentieth, I got her some very lovely handkerchiefs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Oh no. But, you know, they had my initials on them.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, it was a very, very high-class item. I didn't even
           know her size. I'm going over.
          Carol bursts out laughing.
                         
          Black screen. Actually, we are in :
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Carol and Larry's apartment is quite different from the one we've
          just left. It is the apartment of a couple of New-York
          intellectuals, with nice, artistic furniture. We hear a door
          opening.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus, couldn't you keep the conversation going a little
           longer in there ?
                         
          Lights are switched on.
                         
          Full shot. We see only part of the hall, the camera being in a
          corridor, and the walls of the corridor concealing part of the
          hall.
          Carol enters the apartment, and Larry holds the door for her.
                         
                          LARRY
           I was signaling you frantically.
                         
          Larry closes the door.
                         
                          CAROL
           I was just trying to be neighborly.
                         
                          LARRY
           Neighborly ? If this guy showed me his stamp collection one
           more time... I mean, my favorite thing in life is to, you
           know, look at canceled postage.
                         
          The camera follows Larry walking in the corridor toward :
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Actually there are two large beds in the bedroom, the room being
          divided by a partition set between the two beds. The partition is
          only a half wall. There is a opening, without door, at each end of
          the partition, to go from one section of the room to the other.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, come on, Larry. It was sweet. They, you know, they're
           looking forward to their anniversary.
                         
          Medium shot of Larry taking his jacket off. He puts it on a chair.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, and I'm looking forward to seeing that Bob Hope movie.
           I don't know why they put it on so late.
                         
          The camera turns back to the corridor and Carol, still in the
          front hall.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, do you think that's gonna happen to us ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What ?
                         
          Carol walks in the corridor, toward the bedroom.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, that we'll become like them ? You know, just another
           dull aging couple, you know, with our little walks, you
           know...
                         
          She walks into the bedroom.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           We are a dull aging couple.
                         
                          CAROL
           Our TV, our lox and bagels. And... and our twin cemetery
           plots ?
                         
          Larry is seated on his bed. Carol looks at some pills bottles on
          the night table.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, we should be as lucky as them. To, you know, to be in
           their physical shape, at their age ? They look great. Did
           you see the dumbbells this guy lifts ? If I lifted
           dumbbells like those, I would get a hernia the size of the
           San Andrea's Fault.
                         
                          CAROL
           How often do you think they make love ?
                         
          She goes out of the main part of the room, and the camera follows
          her.
                         
          She sits down on the other bed and starts taking her shoes off.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, you know, probably more than we do, in their shape. You
           know, I'm sure as much as once a week.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           I'm exhausted. What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Do you still find me attractive ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Of course. What kind of question is that ? Of course I do.
                         
          Carol stands up from the bed and moves across the room. The
          camera, still located in the main part of the room, follows Carol,
          so we don't actually see her walking, but we see the partition and
          the large clock on it.
           CAROL (voice over from behind the partition)
           Yeah, but we're not turning into a pair of comfortable old
           shoes, are we ? Do you think ?
                         
          Carol reappears on the other side of the partition.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Never comfortable.
                         
                          CAROL
           No ?
                         
          Larry's head appears in the forefront of the shot. He is still
          seated on the bed.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't think you have to worry about that.
                         
          MARKET PLACE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot on a large outdoor antique market place in New-York.
          The camera pans along the stands in the market, showing sellers
          and customers.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           How you guys doing ?
                         
           SY (voice over)
           We're fine.
                         
           MARILYN (voice over)
           We're good.
                         
           SY (voice over)
           We like that. We're gonna get this one.
                         
           MARILYN (voice over)
           That's very nice, actually.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           So, actually...
                         
           MARILYN (voice over)
           Listen, are we going to see you at Elaine's Thursday ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, no. Thursday's our Wagner opera.
                         
          Medium shot on a stand around which Larry, Carol, Sy and Marilyn
          are standing. Sy and Marilyn are a couple about the same age as
          Carol and Larry.
                         
                          MARILYN
           Uh...hum. You know... Ted's coming to Elaine's with us.
                         
                          CAROL
           Ted.
                         
                          MARILYN
           Yeah.
                         
                          CAROL
           How is Ted ?
                         
                          MARILYN
           He's... he seems to be doing well. I mean, I... I actually
           think he's glad... I think he's glad he's divorced.
                         
                          SY
           Well, I don't think he's... no, he's not doing... Come on,
           he's not doing well at all. He's not used to it.
                         
                          MARILYN
           Well he looks... I think he looks, you know, like he's
           glad.
                         
          Sy looks at some of the antique displayed on the stand.
                         
                          SY
           Yeah, yeah. This.
                          LARRY
           So what do you want to do ? you guys gonna browse, or...
                         
                          SY
           No, we're gonna go to a movie.
                         
                          MARILYN
           Yeah, we're gonna go see «Double indemnity».
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, really ?
                         
                          MARILYN
           Yeah.
                         
                          SY
           Why don't you come with us ?
                         
                          MARILYN
           It starts in a little while.
                         
          MOVIE THEATER - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the screen of the theater, on which the film «Double
          Indemnity» is shown. And under the screen, in the dark, the back
          of some of the spectator's heads.
                         
          This film is a very famous 1944 film directed by Billy Wilder, and
          referred by the Library of Congress as one of the hundred best
          films of the Twentieth Century. The term «double indemnity» refers
          to a clause in certain life insurance policies that doubles the
          payout in cases when death is caused by certain accidental means.
                         
           BARTON KEYES (played by Edward G. Robinson)
           I'd have the police after her so fast, it'd make her head
           spin. They'd put her through the wringer. And brother, the
           things they would squeeze out.
           WALTER NEFF (played by Fred MacMurray)
           They haven't got a single thing to go on, Keyes.
                         
                          BARTON KEYES
           Oh, not too much, I guess. Just twenty-six year
           experience... All the percentage there is, and this hunk of
           concrete in my stomach.
                         
          The third character in the sequence, Phyliss Dietrichson, played
          by Barbara Stanwyck, is half-hiding behind a wall.
                         
          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the street, where Larry's apartment building is
          located. The camera is set near the entrance of the building, and
          Carol and Larry are walking toward us.
                         
                          CAROL
           God, that movie was great, wasn't it ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I... I... it was one of my favorites.
                          CAROL
           I loved it.
                         
                          LARRY
           It just... they were all so wonderful, in the picture.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, who could we fix Ted up with ? I mean, there must
           be somebody in your office.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ted ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, I don't know. Ted... I always thought Ted had a crush
           on you.
                         
                          CAROL
           Me ?
                         
          She laughs. They have reached their building. The camera turns
          around to follows them inside the building. Larry puts his hand on
          Carol's back to guide her inside the building. We see an ambulance
          revolving light reflected in the glass door of the building.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. Why are you so stunned ? I think that...
                         
                          CAROL
           Please. I mean, you know, I adore him, but you know, he's
           like a girlfriend to me.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh. Now he's divorced, you know ?
                          CAROL
           Do I detect a note of jealousy ?
                         
          The camera is still on the sidewalk near the entrance of the
          building and we see Carol and Larry walking toward the elevators.
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A short black screen, which actually is just a close shot on the
          outer door of the elevator. This door slides open, and we get a
          medium shot of Larry and Carol inside the elevator.
                         
          They seem surprised by what they see on the landing. There is a
          gathering of neighbors, which we don't yet see. But we hear their
          voices.
                         
           NEIGHBOR (voice over)
           I had to come up here and call nine-one-one.
                         
           ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)
           So what's the trouble ?
                          ANOTHER NEIGHBOR
           Oh, is that the-that the E.M.S.
                         
           ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)
           That guy's so excited.
                         
           ANOTHER NEIGHBOR (voice over)
           The doctor and the E.M.S.
                         
          The camera follows Larry walking toward the group of neighbors.
          Paul's door is wide open.
                         
                          LARRY
           What's the matter ? What's going on ? What happened ?
                         
          He is answered by a tall male neighbor.
                         
                          TALL NEIGHBOR
           She had a heart attack.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh my God !
                         
                          TALL NEIGHBOR
           Sh-She's dead.
                         
          The camera turns around to show us inside the apartment. There is
          a stretcher standing in the corridor. On the stretcher, a body -
          Lilian's body - is covered by a white sheet. Three men are
          standing near the stretcher, one of them wearing green gloves and
          writing on a clipboard, another one carrying a black leather case
          (he is evidently a doctor).
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           She-she's dead ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Dead ?
                         
           NEIGHBOR (voice over)
           They're giving Mr. House a sedative right now. He's running
           around like crazy.
                         
          The camera turns back to the tall neighbor standing near the front
          door. A policeman enters the apartment.
                         
                          TALL NEIGHBOR
           I called E.M.S. and they got here as soon as they could,
           but it was too late.
                         
                          LARRY
           Sh-We just met her last night.
                         
          The camera turns back inside the corridor. The doctor is coming
          toward the front door.
                         
           OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR (voice over)
           Awful, just awful.
           LARRY (voice over)
           What happened ?
                         
                          DOCTOR
           Well, it was a classic coronary. She just went like that.
                         
          The camera turns back toward the group of neighbors.
                         
                          CAROL
           Is there anything we can do ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, my God.
                         
           DOCTOR (voice over)
           You can be good neighbors. You know, we calmed him down,
           uh...
                         
                          LARRY
           Th-Th-Th-The first time we saw them was last night. We just
           met them. W-We had... They invited us in for coffee.
                         
                          TALL NEIGHBOR
           Such a... S... Such a nice lady.
                         
           OLD FEMALE NEIGHBOR
           Nice lady.
                         
           NEIGHBOR WITH A MOUSTACHE
           Sweet person.
                         
          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Larry and Carol are
          coming out. They are very elegantly dressed, Larry wearing a suit
          and a necktie.
                         
                          CAROL
           God, okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           You look wonderful.
                         
          Paul is coming down the street toward the entrance of the
          building. He is carrying some grocery in a paper bag.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, hallo.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hi.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hi, Mr. House, so... sorry.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you so much for those wonderful flowers.
                         
          Paul seems very relax. He smiles a lot, which could be surprising,
          when we understand he put his wife in the grave only a couple of
          days ago.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh.
                         
                          PAUL
           It was quite nice of you.
                         
                          CAROL
           That's... sure.
                         
                          LARRY
           If there's anything we can do. You know, anything you need,
           just tell us and we'll...
                         
                          CAROL
           No, anything. Anything at all. I mean, God, it's just such
           a shock when anyone... It was just so sudden. I mean, she
           seemed so... God, well, healthy.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           She had a heart condition.
                         
                          CAROL
           She did ? She never mentioned it... It... that she was...
                         
                          LARRY
           Ah.
                         
                          PAUL
           She wouldn't have.
                         
                          CAROL
           No. Right. Well...
                          LARRY
           If there's anything we can do.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, anything. Really.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, if you need anything, if you are lonely, come by.
           You know.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you. You know, you owe me a wonderful French dessert.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, no, no, no. I know, I haven't forgotten. Believe me, I
           haven't forgotten.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, have a nice time. You seem all gussied up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Oh, I know. We're going to the opera.
                          PAUL
           Oh, enjoy.
                         
                          LARRY
           My favorite, my favorite.
                         
                          PAUL
           Goodnight.
                         
          He walks away toward the entrance of the building, still smiling a
          lot and looking very happy. Carol looks at him with a question on
          her face.
                         
                          LARRY
           Goodnight.
                         
                          CAROL
           Goodnight.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come, we're gonna be late.
                         
          THE METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Long shot on the Met building.
                         
          We hear the music from Wagner's The Flying Dutchman.
                         
          The camera slowly tilts down. We don't see Carol and Larry yet,
          but we hear their voices.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           The deal was, I sit through the ice hockey game and you
           watch the whole opera.
                         
          The camera is now on ground level, and we see Carol and Larry
          coming out of the Met.
                          LARRY
           I can't listen to that much Wagner, you know. I start to
           get the urge to conquer Poland.
                         
          They cross the esplanade in front of the Met.
                         
          ELAINE'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Elaine's is a cosy place, like there are many around Greenwich
          Village.
                         
          Carol and Larry are eating at Elaine's with Sy, Marilyn and Ted.
          Ted is a quite handsome man in his forties.
                         
          We get a medium full view of the party, with a very mobile camera
          moving around the table and going from one person to another,
          getting closer to one person, then moving slightly away.
                         
                          SY
           I'll tell you something. I think it's weird. I mean, listen
           to this. One night she's having coffee, and the next night
           they are carrying her out in a rubber bag.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I know, I know. And she did not look like she was ready
           to go.
                         
                          TED
           Maybe this guy killed her, you know ? Like, he's got, like,
           a young tootsie stashed someplace, or something.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, not this... you gotta, you gotta see this guy. This
           guy gets his jollies from licking the back of postage
           stamps. He's a-a boring old...
                         
                          TED
           Well, I can see that. Yeah, depending on whose picture is
           on the stamp.
                         
                          CAROL
           She never once mentioned that she had a heart condition.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, what is she gonna say ? Oh, yeah, hello, I'm Mrs.
           House and I have a bad heart.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, she had no problem telling me about her hysterectomy
           in the first five minutes.
                         
                          SY
           It is much easier to talk about a hysterectomy than it is
           to talk about a heart condition.
                         
                          TED
           You said she liked... she liked eating high cholesterol
           desserts. Is that what you said ?
                          LARRY
           So, she had one too many.
                         
                          CAROL
           No. No ! She wasn't on a diet. We discussed diets.
                         
                          LARRY
           So she wasn't on a diet. But...
                         
                          TED
           This would be a really great way to kill somebody.
                         
                          SY
           How ?
                         
                          TED
           You clog their arteries with whipped cream, chocolate
           mousse, butter. They go like that.
                         
          Carol is laughing very heartily at Ted's joke.
                         
                          SY
          That's great.
                         
                         LARRY
          I like a... It's disgusting.
                         
                         TED

          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Medium shot of Carol coming out of the bathroom. She switches the
          bathroom light off. She is wearing a pink night dress.
                         
          The camera turns toward Larry's bed, in which Larry is already
          lying. He has a book in his hands.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, I was thinking of fixing Ted up with Helen Dubin.
           You know, I figured they would just, you know, get into an
           argument over penis envy, or something.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh.
                         
                          LARRY
           The poor guy suffers from it so...
                         
          Carol puts something on the night-table on her side of the bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           Did he seem a little too cheerful ?
                         
          She looks at some pills bottles on the night table.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, he seemed like his regular self to me, but-but, uh,
           when you brought up the notion of the restaurant... the guy
           lit up like Mr. Glowworm.
                         
                          CAROL
           The restaurant ?
                         
          She picks up a hair brush.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. He sees himself as, uh, you know, as Humphrey Bogart
           in Casablanca. I-I see him more as Peter Lorre, wringing
           his hands.
          Carol starts walking toward the other section of the room. The
          camera follows her.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, no. No, no, no. I mean, Mr. House, Mr. House.
           Didn't seem a little too cheerful to you ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Mr. House, our next-door widower ?
                         
          Carol stops in front of a large mirror set on the wall in one
          corner of the room.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes. Yes. I mean, there's... Well, you know. I mean, didn't
           he seem too compose for a man whose wife just died. Don't
           you think ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Well, Jesus. What do you want the guy to do, walk down the
           street sobbing hysterically ?
          Carol starts brushing her hair.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, I don't know. All I know is, they were supposedly
           looking forward to their, you know... anniversary, and,
           and, and, you know, uh-uh, i-i-if... I suddenly dropped
           dead... wouldn't you sob for months, or-or years, if I...
           You know...
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Hey, don't make those kind of jokes, okay ? I don't like
           those remarks. And, meanwhile, I'm the guy who needs a
           physical check-up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I don't know.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Uh, uh.
                         
          Carol walks to a chest of drawers, on top of which she drops the
          hairbrush. Then she switches the lights off in the other section
          of the bedroom, and walks back to the bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, to me he just seemed a little too perky. You know ?
           Now, suddenly he wants his French desserts, and, «Have a
           nice time, you know, at the opera». And, my God, «We're
           certainly dressed up». I mean, you know. This guy should be
           a wreck.
                         
          She sits down on her side of the bed, and takes her socks off.
          While talking, Larry puts the book and his glasses on the night-
          table. Carol switches the light off on her night table and gets
          into the bed.
                         
                          LARRY
           Right. Meanwhile, I can't get the-the Flying Dutchman theme
           out of my mind, you know ? Remind me tomorrow to buy up all
           the Wagner records in town and rent a chainsaw.
                         
          He switches the lights off on his bed table. The room is
          completely dark, and we hear the next sentences on a black screen.
                         
                          CAROL
           Helen Dubin's wrong for Ted.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah ?
                         
                          CAROL
           She's too mousey.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, he's a little mousey, too. They could have their
           little rodent time. They can eat cheese together.
                         
          Carol bursts out laughing. The phone starts ringing.
                          LARRY
           Oh, Christ.
                         
          He switches the light back on, puts his glasses on his nose and
          picks up the phone.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hallo ? Yes. Yes, of.... Yes, of course you woke us. You
           know, not everybody's up at one o'clock in the morning
           watching the porn channel. I'll put her on.
                         
          He gives the phone receiver to Carol.
                         
                          CAROL

           then he turned the exercise program up to the Olympic
           levels.

                          CAROL
           No, no. You know, I mean, I just think this guy is too
           perky. You know, I mean he's not acting like a man whose
           beloved of twenty-eight years died just a few days ago.
                         
          Larry is trying to get the telephone cord, stretched from his
          night-table to the handset hold by Carol, away from his face.
                         
                          LARRY

                          CAROL
           Oh, I see.
                         
                          TED
           And then you come out, to this here.
                         
          They have reached the yard. The camera moves back to get a medium
          shot of them both.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, look at this though. It's really so beautiful.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah. Isn't it great ?
                          CAROL
           But... it's kind out of the way for a restaurant, isn't
           it ?
                         
                          TED
           No, no... that's the appeal. That's just the appeal,
           because it's... it's, I mean it's so romantic... tucked
           away back in here like this.
                         
          The camera leaves Carol and Ted in the middle of the yard and
          moves up and around to show us the old building around the yard.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           And, you don't want street traffic. You want...
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           No.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           you want a little out of the way spot that people hear
           about and lovers go to.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           It takes months to take a reservation, you know ? Very few
           tables.
                         
          The camera moves down to ground level to give us a better view of
          the yard. It does look a bit neglected, with weeds growing in
          between the stones covering the ground. There are some trees and a
          small out-of-order fountain with a statue on top of it.
           CAROL (voice over)
           You know, you've really thought this out.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Oh, well, I used to come here all the time with-with July,
           when we were married.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Uh uh. Right.
                         
          The camera moves back to Carol and Ted.
                         
                          TED
           Used to walk around here. Really beautiful at night. It's
           gorgeous at night.
                         
                          CAROL
           It's beautiful, I bet.
                         
                          TED
           I used to think, «What am I doing here with July ? We don't
           love each other any more», you know ? It made the moment
           doubly poignant.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot of the corridor, showing the front door. Paul opens
          the front door. Larry and Carol are standing in the doorway. Larry
          is wearing a necktie and Carol is carrying a large tray.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hi. How are you ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Hi. How are you ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, my...
                         
                          CAROL
           These are my floating islands. I hope you like meringue.
                         
          Paul takes the tray from Carol's hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           I love it. Come on in, come on in.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, okay.
                         
                          PAUL
           This is unbelievable.
                         
          Carol enters the apartment, followed by Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, it's just...
                         
                          PAUL
           Did you do it ?
          Larry closes the door behind him.
                         
                          CAROL
           I did do it. I told you. Anyway, this has got... this is
           vanilla sauce here and I put little chocolate truffles.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, come on in.
                         
                          CAROL
           Do you like chocolate truffles ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Would you share it with me ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, no. She made these just for you. This is...
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well...
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They all enter the living room.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, no, no, it's too much for one. I'll I make some coffee.
           Please.
                         
                          LARRY
           They're only half a dozen.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, no. Look, I'll make the coffee. That'd be better.
           Let me make it.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, you've already done so much.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no. I insist, I insist. Go on, sit down, relax.
                         
          She takes the tray from Paul's hands.
                         
                          PAUL
           Aren't you nice.
                         
                          CAROL
           Enjoy yourself, you've been through enough.
                         
          She walks to the kitchen, carrying the tray.
                         
                          LARRY
           She worked on those for... How're you holding up ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, I don't know. I was thinking after a while. I'd get
           away from here. From this place and all its memories.
                          LARRY
           Uh uh, so you have someone to go with, or are you...
                         
                          PAUL
           I have a brother in Florida.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, really ?
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm hoping he can get away for a while.
                         
                          LARRY
           Good. It's a good idea.
                         
                          PAUL
           Do you like snorkeling ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Snorkeling ? No, no. I get nervous when brightly colored
           fish are staring at me face to face, you know.
                          PAUL
           Hey, I've got some stamps I wanted to show you.
                         
          He turns to his desk to pick up a stamp album.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, stamps. Well, that's...
                         
                          PAUL
           Come on, look at these.
                         
          The camera pans to the kitchen.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The conversation between Paul and Larry keeps going in the living-
          room but we can't understand the words.
                         
          Carol puts water in the glass jar of the coffee machine. She puts
          the lid on the jar and turns around to put the jar in the machine.
          She looks in the coffee plastic container and notices there is no
          coffee inside. She bends down and opens the cupboard door. Not
          finding any coffee in the cupboard, she closes it, stands up and
          turns around to look inside the cupboard above the sink. She
          closes it, and bends down to look inside the cupboard next to the
          dishwasher. She seems surprised by something and pauses. Then she
          takes a copper funeral urn from inside the cupboard. She stands up
          and takes the lid off the urn. She looks inside the urn and closes
          it. She seems a bit shocked and bends down to put the urn back
          inside the cupboard. Then she stands up and looks absently around
          her.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          A little later.
                         
          Full shot of the room. Larry and Carol are sitting next to each
          other on the sofa. Carol is drinking coffee from a cup, and Larry
          is staring, with his arms crossed on his chest, looking a little
          bored. Paul is sitting on an armchair and eating the floating
          islands from a plate he is holding in his other hand.
                         
                         
                          PAUL
           This is very delicious.
                         
                          CAROL
           Thank you.
                         
                          PAUL
           You are an artist.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, thanks very much. Uh, was it a large... funeral ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, no. We had... very few friends, no family.
                         
          The camera moves closer to Larry and Carol.
                          CAROL
           Right. Just a simple affair, uh ? Well, they're the best,
           aren't they ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah.
                         
                          CAROL
           I guess. Anyway, then you're laid the rest, and, you know,
           I was just... where, um, where are the twin cemetery
           plots ? We... because, we were thinking that that was just
           such a romantic idea. Weren't we, Larry ? You know ?
           Larry ? You remember when we were talking about the twin
           cemetery plots and, you know, how kind of romantic that
           is ? Remember ?
                         
          Larry looks at his wife. He has a little difficulty to come back
          into a conversation he wasn't following.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh-huh. Yes, yes. We were. We were spending the eternity
           with the beloved. I sound like... I sound like one of those
           guys, now.
                         
          The camera pans to Paul. He has put his plate on the low table.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yes.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yes but, I was just wondering where, um, where is the
           cemetery ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, it's... uh, in... uh, it's in Nyack. We used to summer
           there occasionally.
                         
          He wipes his lips with his napkin.
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot. Larry enters the apartment, followed by Carol, who
          then walks in front of him.
                         
                          LARRY
           What was all that stuff about twin cemetery plots ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know ? I mean, we-we never discussed it at all, but I
           knew that you were trying to tell me something, so I picked
           up on it quickly.
                         
          He closes the door behind him.
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen.
                          LARRY
           But I... You know, we...
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, just... I was in the kitchen okay ? And I was making
           the coffee. There were no beans, so, I was looking in his
           cupboards, just to see, you know, and I came across this
           urn, okay ? And I opened it and there were ashes in it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ashes ? Funeral ashes ? Did you wash your hands ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, he had her cremated !
                         
                          LARRY
           How did you know it was her, for Christ's sake ? They were
           ashes. What, did they resemble Mrs. House ?
                         
          He walks into the living-room.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, and who else would it be, okay ?
                         
          Larry picks up his jacket from the back of an armchair.
                         
                          LARRY
           Anybody. Could it be, an associate, an old relative, his
           accountant, his cat. Who knows ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Right, right. Hidden, uh ? Hidden away ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean? Th-th-the guy didn't do anything.
                         
          The camera pans across the hall toward the kitchen. She has a box
          (cereals ?) in her hand.
                          CAROL
           Look, Larry. All I know is he lied, okay ? He lied.
                         
          She puts the box in a cupboard above the sink. Then she picks up
          the phone on the wall.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Look. Maybe-maybe-maybe he is embarrassed. Maybe he didn't
           want to spend eternity next to the beloved, so he-he told
           us that-uh... You know, what's the difference ? Who are you
           calling ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Ted !
                         
          The camera pans back to the living-room and Larry. Larry walks
          behind a partition, still holding his jacket. The camera follows
          his movement.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus. Leave the guy alone. You know, he-he... he's a
           poor widower, he wants to go on a vacation or something.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah. Where ? Oh, I know where, ah ah. Snorkeling, right ?
           Ah ah.
                         
          Larry puts the jacket on something we don't see because it is
          hidden by the partition. Then he picks up a brochure on a low
          table and walks toward the kitchen. The camera follows him.
                         
                          LARRY
           So what ? Different strokes. You know, he has fun, uh,
           sitting at the bottom of the water, face to face with
           squid.
                         
          Carol is still standing in the kitchen, with the phone handset on
          her ear.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I know. I know. What about this ? What if they had a
           big insurance policy, or something like that, huh ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Too much «Double Indemnity», you know ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Hu-Huh.
           (speaking on the phone)
           Hi. Yeah. Hi, it's me. Listen, we were just in our
           neighbor's apartment, right ?
                         
          Larry walks away from the kitchen.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. And get this. I came across an urn with ashes in
           it. Only he says he had his wife buried.
                         
          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Ted is lying on a large comfortable sofa, sipping beer from a
          bottle.
                         
                          TED
           That's what you do if you don't want an autopsy. You don't
           want something discovered, you know ? Like-like poison.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Carol is still standing up, the telephone handset stuck between
          her ear and her shoulder.
                         
                          CAROL
           Mm. Right. They'd have detected poison, wouldn't they ?
                         
          TED'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
                          TED
           Uh, I don't know. There's a lot of different kinds of
           exotic poisons, you know ?
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the kitchen, seen from the hall. Carol is still
          standing up but now she holding the phone handset with her hand.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, but why would he... Why would he be lying ? I mean,
           why-why would he lie at all ?
                         
          Larry walks back into the kitchen.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus, you're up to poisons already. You guys are slipping
           into a mad obsession.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Oh, would you do that ? Because... That'd be great.
           Because, you know, I'm not good at that kind of thing,
           okay ? All right. Okay. Well, I'll talk to you later. Okay,
           bye.
                         
          She puts the phone back on its hook on the wall
                         
                          LARRY
           Let's go to bed. Could we go to bed, now ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, I'm not tired.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, «You're not tired» ?
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, Ted's gonna check with the funeral home,
           tomorrow.
                         
                          LARRY
           Great.
                          CAROL
           You know what I mean ? I mean, I don't understand why
           you're not, not more fascinated with this. We could be
           living next door to a murderer, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, New York is a melting pot. You know, get used to it.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Later in the night.
                         
          Medium shot on the bed. Larry is asleep, but Carol is not. She
          moves in the bed, and then sits up. She turns around, pats her
          pillow, and tries to lie back on her side. But she sits up again,
          looking around the room. Eventually, she gets out of the bed.
                         
          She walks around the bed in the dark, and switches on the lights
          in the corridor. The camera follows her in the corridor.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Carol switches the lights on in the hall, then she looks into the
          peephole in the front door.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh my God !
                         
          The camera turns around toward the corridor. Larry is getting out
          of the bedroom, putting his slippers on.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, are you okay ?
                         
          Carol walks in the corridor toward him.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry. Larry, I heard a noise. I-I-I heard a noise in the
           hallway, so I just... I... You know, I-I looked and I
           think... I think Mr. House was getting on the elevator.
                         
          Larry hops toward her, still trying to put his slippers on. She
          backs up and they are now both in the front hall.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah ? You're sure ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, you know, I was... I'm-I'm... almost certain that it
           was him.
                         
                          LARRY
           So-So-So what ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Just, you know... I mean, who else could it be ?
                         
                          LARRY
           So what ? It's not a crime. He can get on the elevator.
                          CAROL
           I know. I know. But wh-who would it be at one-thirty in the
           morning ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus. I was in a deep sleep. What-What's the
           difference ?
                         
                          CAROL
           But, you mean, you know how we're always complaining about
           living on the geriatric floor. Do you know what I'm
           saying ? A joke ?
                         
          While Larry is answering her, Carol opens the front door and peeks
          into the hallway.
                         
                          LARRY
           All right, so it was Mr. House. So he got on the elevator.
           It's not a felony. The guy pays rent. He's entitled. I
           mean, what... Can you go back to bed ? This is crazy. You
           woke me up out of a deep sleep. I gotta get up early
           tomorrow morning.
                         
          Carol closes the door, and walks toward the kitchen. The camera
          follows her.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Carol looks through a notebook.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna ring him up. I'm gonna
           ring his apartment. I'm gonna see if he's home.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           You're gonna ring Mr. House, now ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, because this is really...
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What are you talking about ?
                         
                          CAROL
           It's very sus...
                         
          Larry joins Carol when she already has the handset in her hand.
          But she succeeds in dialing Paul's number.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't ring Mr... What are you doing ? No, don't ring...
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me just... Larry, don't. Wait.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't ring Mr. house. This is a widower. Leave the poor guy
           alone. You're crazy. Stop it.
          Carol listens to the phone.
                         
                          CAROL
           That's one ring.
                         
                          LARRY
           So you saw him go out. It's not a-not a crime.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, two rings. He's not there, yet.
                         
          Larry takes the handset from Carol's hand.
                         
                          LARRY
           Give me this. Give me this.
                         
                          CAROL
           What are you doing ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Look, if you want to find out if somebody left, just call
           downstairs. Call the-the-the person at the desk.
                          CAROL
           All right, I'll call. Just keep ringing.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ask if someone went out.
                         
                          CAROL
           Keep ringing.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, um. Sure, I'm gonna keep ringing. You got it.
                         
          While Carol walks out of the kitchen, Larry puts the phone back on
          its hook on the wall.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, man.
                         
          Carol walks into the hall. The camera follows her.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           This is insane. What's gotten into you ?
                         
          Carol picks up the building internal telephone handset from the
          wall.
                         
                          CAROL
           I don't know. What is he doing ? Where is this guy at one-
           thirty in the morning ? You know what I'm saying ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           It's not your business. He can go any place he wants.
                         
           CAROL (in the phone)
           Hallo ? Yes, hallo. This is Mrs. Lipton. Yes. Did anybody
           just leave the building ? I'm just... hmm. You're sure ?
           You're sure no one ? No, okay. All right. Yes. Thank you.
                         
          While she was talking on the phone, the camera has moved toward
          Larry, standing at the entrance of the kitchen.
                         
                          LARRY
           Okay. Are you happy ?
                         
          We hear the noise of the phone being put back on its hook.
                         
                          CAROL
           I don't believe this. Man, I don't get it.
                         
          Larry joins his wife in the hall.
                         
                          LARRY
           Now, can we back to bed ?
                         
                          CAROL
           No.
                          LARRY
           For crying out loud, it's no big deal. You're making a
           mystery where nothing exists.
                         
                          CAROL
           Just let me think about this a second. Okay, I got it.
           Wait. I know, it... No, wait. Listen to me. Larry...
           Listen. He got on the elevator, okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, I'm gonna...
                         
                          CAROL
           No, wait. No, no, listen to this. No.
                         
                          LARRY
           I wanna go to sleep. I don't want to be standing here in
           the middle of the night.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. Larry, he got on the elevator and he took it to the
           basement.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, great ! Great ! So what ? Now, what've you got ?
                         
                          CAROL
           He has a car, right ? He's got the garage door key, he
           opened... he could... he has the...
                         
                          LARRY
           So what ? So what ?
                         
                          CAROL
           What do you mean, «so what» ? He's...
                         
                          LARRY
           What's the big deal ? So, the next-door neighbor went out
           in the middle of the night and took his car. So, he went
           someplace.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right. So, I'm right, though.
                         
          She starts walking back to the bedroom. Larry follows her. The
          camera remains in the front hall, filming them.
                         
                          LARRY
           That's all.
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, I'm right.
                         
                          LARRY
           I mean, so you're right. So big deal.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, he isn't in his apartment.
                         
                          LARRY
           But this kind of right is gonna put us in the toilet. So,
           you're right. You're suspicious.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, that's right.
                         
                          LARRY
           It says more about your mind that about him.
                         
                          CAROL
           What about your rigidity ? How about that ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Get into bed. Get into bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           How about that point ?
                         
                          LARRY
           You're so... What's wrong with you ? Jesus !
                         
          They disappear in the bedroom.
                         
          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot on the crossroad between the street where Larry's
          residence is located and another street. Carol is crossing the
          street. She stops walking while on the crosswalk. The camera zooms
          on her and we see an expression of surprise on her face.
                         
          Reverse angle long shot on the entrance of Larry's building. Paul
          comes out of the building. The camera zooms on him : he looks
          around him as if afraid to be followed.
                         
          Reverse angle shot on Carol looking at him from a distance. She
          enters her building. She smiles to the attendant on duty.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hi !
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of Carol walking down the staircase leading to the
          basement. We see her through the glass panel of a heavy metal
          safety door. She opens the door.
                         
                          CAROL
           Jack ?
                         
          The camera follows Carol to a reverse angle shot showing the
          workshop of Jack, the factotum caretaker of the building. With a
          screwdriver and a plier in his hands, he is working on something
          we don't see.
                         
                          CAROL
           Jack, do you think you could come upstairs today, because I
           got a leak in the kitchen ?
                         
                          JACK
           Well, yeah. Yeah.
                          CAROL
           You can ?
                         
                          JACK
           Sure.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, but, it will be this afternoon.
                         
                          JACK
           But I... I got...
                         
                          CAROL
           All right, you're not gonna go now ?
                         
                          JACK
           I'll be back in about a minute.
                         
          Jack walks out of his workshop and along one of the basement
          corridors.
                         
                          CAROL
           In a minute.
                         
                          JACK
           Okay, just wait a second. I'll be right back.
                         
          The camera follows Jack walking away.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah. Okay. All right. Oh, God.
                         
          The camera turns around to a reverse angle shot on Carol, still in
          the workshop. She looks around, apparently looking for something.
          She peeks through the door of the workshop, to make sure Jack is
          not coming back too early. Carol rushes to a key-box on the wall,
          into which there is a spare key for every apartment in the
          building. She selects a key, takes it out of the box and puts it
          in her pocket. Then she leaves the workshop toward the staircase.
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of the hallway. Carol comes out of the elevator, and
          looks around her. She walks back and forth in the hallway, before
          coming back to Paul's apartment door, just in front of the
          elevator. She opens the door with the key she has just stolen in
          Jack's workshop.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room. The front
          corridor is completely dark. The door opens and Carol walks in.
          She closes the door behind her.
                         
          Carol walks toward the living room, and the light coming from the
          windows.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
          Carol crosses the kitchen. She kneels down to look into the
          cupboard where she had found the funeral urn. Apparently the urn
          is not there anymore.
                         
          NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot on a crosswalk in New-York. Paul is crossing the street.
                         
          The camera zooms on Paul. He has almost crossed the street, but he
          suddenly stops a few feet from the next sidewalk. He feels his
          jacket : apparently he has forgotten something in his apartment.
          He turns around and starts walking back on the crosswalk.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Carol is still looking in all the cupboards of the kitchen. She
          gets out of the kitchen into the living-room.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The camera pans around the room, following Carol, who looks inside
          every piece of furniture in the room.

          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Carol has picked up a few papers from a low table, and is looking
          at them. She puts her hand into her trouser pocket to get her
          glasses out. She puts her glasses on to have a better look at the
          documents she has found.
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Through the window of the lobby, we get a full shot of Paul coming
          toward the entrance of the building. An attendant rushes to open
          the door for him.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Carol is sitting at the desk. She has opened the drawer of the
          desk and is looking through its content. She takes an Air France
          ticket folder out of the drawer and looks inside it. Then she
          picks up another one.

          desk, and the shot is taken from the other side of the room,
          showing Ted's back. The phone rings. Ted picks it up.
                         
                          TED

                          CAROL
           The urn is missing. It's gone. Yeah, I think it might have
           been. He had this satchel last night. He was carrying this
           bag, and I think that might have been what he had in his
           satchel.

                          TED
           Listen, I'd get out of there right away, if I were you.
                         
          The camera moves around Ted, showing the typewriter he is typing
          on.
                          TED
           No, no, no. Go, go, go. We'll do... We'll talk more from
           your apartment.

           He's not going snorkeling with his brother. He's got two
           tickets to Paris, and he's got reservations at the Georges
           Cinq hotel with a woman named Helen Moss.
                         
          She turns around, because she feels she heard a noise in the
          landing hallway.
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          One of Paul's neighbor is standing in the hallway, waiting for the
          elevator. He's got some documents in his hand. The elevator dings
          and the door opens. Paul comes out.
                          NEIGHBOR
           Oh. Hi. How are you ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Good morning. How are you ?
                         
          Paul has his key in his hand and is ready to open his apartment
          door.
                         
                          NEIGHBOR
           Good. You got the notice on the... Uh, maintenance
           increase ?
                         
          Paul turns around to look at the neighbor.
                         
                          PAUL
           No. When did that happen ?

                          CAROL
           I'm gonna look around and see what else I can dig up here,
           okay ? Yeah. I'm telling you, this is just... Ted, I-I'm
           just dizzy with freedom. This is just... uh, this is just
           the craziest thing I've ever done.

                          TED
           Yes, it's crazy. But soon, we'll be too old to do anything

          when she hears the front door opening.
                         
          Black screen shot on the front door in the dark of the corridor,
          then the camera quickly spins around to show Carol, standing in
          the living-room, with a frightened look on her face. She walks
          away from the room. The camera spins back to the front door, which
          opens. Paul enters and switches the lights on. He closes the front
          door, and walks along the corridor to the living-room.
                         
          Carol walks into the kitchen from the living-room.
                         
          The camera pans to Paul, looking for something on his desk. He
          looks through all the documents scattered on the desk.
                         
          The camera pans back to Carol, hiding in the kitchen, then back to
          Paul.
          Paul opens both his hands in a gesture of despair : apparently, he
          hasn't found what he was looking for. He starts walking across the
          room, and the camera pans back to Carol in the kitchen. She rushes
          out of the kitchen.
                         
          The camera remains at the same spot, and we see Paul in the
          living-room, still looking for whatever he is missing. He walks
          out of the living-room through the kitchen.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Paul enters the room, looking in the inner pocket of his jacket.
          He walks around the room, and opens a closet. He looks through the
          hanging clothes, and finds a few documents in one of the jackets.
          He closes the closet, and starts looking through the documents he
          has found. He puts them inside the inner pocket of his jacket. He
          starts walking out of the room, when the phone rings. He stops and
          picks up the phone receiver on one of the night-tables.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hallo.
                         
          Medium shot of Carol hiding under the bed. We notice she doesn't
          have her glasses anymore.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Oh, hi. Yeah. I know. I-I...Yes, I miss you, too. I did. I
           made all the arrangements.
                         
          Back to Paul standing by the bed and talking in the telephone.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah, look. I... Okay, I have to run. But I'll see you
           later, okay ? Okay.
                         
          He puts the phone down on its hook, and starts walking out of the
          room. He stops, thinks for a couple of seconds, turns around, sits
          on the bed and picks up the phone.
          Back to Carol under the bed. The bed frame hits her back when Paul
          sits on it. She looks up. We hear Paul dialing a number.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Extension five. Well, keep ringing, would you please ?
           Because I just talked to her. What ? Okay. Uh, will you
           tell her... yes, tell her that Tom called. Tom. Thank you.
                         
          Back to Paul sitting on the bed. He puts the phone down on its
          hook, stands up and starts walking out of the room.
                         
          Back to Carol under the bed, waiting for Paul to get out of his
          apartment.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Starting from street level, the camera tilts up along a very
          modern office building, all glass and steel. A sign, above the
          main entrance, says «10 East 53». This is the building where
          Larry's office is located.
          LARRY'OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of a large office room. In the forefront, a reception
          desk, with a young female receptionist talking to someone we still
          don't see. Coming from the other end of the room, Larry is walking
          with Marcia, a tall dark-haired lady, wearing sunglasses.
                         
                          LARRY
           So, I thought your rewrites were great. I really think you
           helped your book, you know ? It's... It's dense a little
           bit, but, uh...
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, I don't want it to be too transparent, I mean...
                         
          They are now at the reception desk level, and, since the camera is
          following them, we can see the young gentleman the receptionist is
          talking with.
                         
                          LARRY
           That's... That's something you're never gonna have to worry
           about, you know ? This book makes «Finnegan's Wake» look
           like airplane reading, you know ? But-But it's long. It's-
           It's-It's...
                         
          They are now walking along a corridor.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You know, you're the only editor in the world I'll take
           suggestions from, but even you shouldn't push it.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, I'm not pushing it. I think the book is great.
           Absolutely great. You know, but, uh... how much, how much
           of Dorothy is you? As I was reading it, I kept thinking how
           much is... you know, how much did you base it on your own
           life ?
          They have now reached a smaller room, actually Larry's private
          room. Marcia takes her glasses off, and then her coat, and sits on
          a sofa.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, I was a waitress. I lived with a poet. I was a film
           critic.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Right, but not-not a blackjack dealer, right ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           No, but I put myself through school playing poker.
                         
          The camera pans to Larry, who is standing up at the other end of
          the room, looking through some documents.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, really ? Do you still play ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           No, but I still know how.
                          LARRY
           Yes ? Are you good ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, because maybe you could give me some pointers.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           I could turn your game around in two hours.
                         
                          LARRY
           Could you ? That's great. That's... you know, you-you have
           all these skills, and you're beautiful, and you can write
           so well... and now it turns out you play poker. This is,
           uh, too good to be true.
                         
          Larry sits down with the pile of documents on his laps. The camera
          pans back to Marcia. She has a cigarette in her hand.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, I wouldn't say beautiful.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, I would.
                         
                          MARCIA
           But I do have tremendous sex-appeal.
                         
          The camera pans back to Larry, who is looking through the huge
          pile of paper on his laps, perhaps a manuscript.
                         
                          LARRY
           Okay, you sold me. Are-are you seeing anybody ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           No. Don't let my confidence fool you, it's a facade. Why do
           you ask ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Because I have a friend who became single recently, and I-I
           know he would get a big kick out of you.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Oh. So, when do you want your poker lessons ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, next week. I could take you to lunch. We could-we
           could, um, I'll put you on my expense account, and you
           could... teach me when to... bet and when to fold.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           How about a cheeseburger right now ?
                         
          The phone rings.
                         
                          LARRY
           Now ? That's a possibility.
          Larry picks up the phone from a small table.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, we could, we could do...
           (talking into the telephone)
           Hallo. Yes ? Where are you ?
                         
          The camera pans back to Marcia, who listens to Larry, smoking her
          cigarette.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Is everything okay ? Really ? No, I could, sure.
                         
          The camera pans back to Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           I could. Yeah. I need-I need, you know, five minutes, or
           so. Okay. Yes. Yes. I know where it is. Okay, hold on.
                         
          He puts the telephone down on its hook.
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't do it. I have to... My wife, I have a little thing
           I have to do. I'll do the cheeseburger with you next week,
           or something.
                         
          The camera pans back to Marcia, who is smiling.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Story of my life !
                         
          She crushes her cigarette in and ashtray and stands up.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A PARK - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of a round concrete pond, with a fountain in the middle
          pouring water. In the background, a meadow, with chairs scattered
          on it. Carol is standing by the pond. Larry is talking to her,
          looking very nervous.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, you snuck into his apartment ? Are you
           nuts ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, stop being such a fuddy-dud.
                         
                          LARRY
           A fuddy-dud ?
                         
          Carol starts walking around the pond. Larry follows her.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           What are you talking about ? That's a crime. You can't do
           that. You... That's-That's burglary and breaking and
           entering. But... What has gotten into you lately ? For
           crying out loud, save a little craziness for menopause.
                         
                          CAROL
           It was a cinch. I took the key and I just let myself in.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, look. Do... I don't want to... You-You'll wind up
           rooming with John Gotti. You can't do that. You can't just
           steal the key and then go into somebody's apartment.
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen. He's not going snorkeling with his brother, okay ?
           Okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't wanna know. I don't wanna be an accessory.
                         
                          CAROL
           He's going to Paris, to a fancy hotel with a woman named
           Helen Moss.
                         
                          LARRY
           Tell Ted. I don't want to know. Leave me alone.
                         
          They keep on walking around the pond, the camera following them
          from a fixed location. They are now hidden by the fountain.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)
           I told Ted.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)
           You told Ted before you told me ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)
           Yeah. He's more open-minded about these things.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)
           Yes, I know. I'm-I'm-I'm a bore. I'm-Because I-Because I
           don't break the law, you know ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)
           Yeah.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from behind the fountain)
           I live within the Constitution, so I'm dull.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from behind the fountain)
           Listen. Perhaps he got rid of the urn, okay ?
                         
          They appear back from behind the fountain.
                         
                          LARRY
           I-I don't wanna hear. Leave me alone. Don't tell me.
                         
                          CAROL
           He talked on the phone with a woman.
                         
                          LARRY
           How do you know ?
                          CAROL
           Because he... Well, he came back while I was there, you
           know, so...
                         
                          LARRY
           He did ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, but I hid under the bed.
                         
                          LARRY
           You hid under his bed ?
                         
                          CAROL
           He didn't see me, Larry. He didn't see me at all.
                         
                          LARRY
           I cannot believe this. My stomach is curdling, here I...
                         
                          CAROL
           He was-He was very lovey-dovey with his kind of bimbo, you
           know ? He kept saying stuff like, you know, «don't worry,
           it's gonna be all right. We're gonna be together.» That
           kind of thing.
                         
          They keep on walking around the pond, slowly coming back toward
          the camera, which moves a little to meet them.
                         
                          LARRY
           But what would you have done if he, if he found you out ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, listen, I-I couldn't think that far ahead.
                         
                          LARRY
           That far ahead ? You're talking two seconds.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, I c...
                         
                          LARRY
           He could have looked under the bed and there you are. What
           do you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, but... Larry, listen. And then, listen to this. He-He
           called this woman back. Probably this-this Helen Moss
           woman, right ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't wanna know. Leave me alone.
                         
                          CAROL
           And when he calls her back, she's not there. And then he
           leaves this message, and he says : «Tell her Tom called».
           You know what I'm saying ? Tom. Tom, Larry.
                         
          They are back at the same place where we saw them first by the
          pond. They stop walking.
                          LARRY
           Yeah, yeah. I... I know, I get it, his name is Paul, but I
           don't care. I don't wanna hear.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, okay. Well, I'll tell you. I thought I did...
                         
                          LARRY
           I just don't...
                         
                          CAROL
           I thought I did a great job, and so did Ted. I don't think
           a private eye could have done any better than me. I put
           everything back where I found it, I was very careful. I
           made one mistake.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I left my reading glasses on his table.
                         
          Larry looks at her with a very puzzled eye.
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium close shot on Paul's apartment front door. We get a close
          shot of the back of Carol's head. The door opens on Paul.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, hallo. Hi. I-I thought I'd bring you some chocolate
           mousse. I know how much you enjoyed the last dessert.
                         
          Carol walks rapidly inside the apartment, followed by Larry. Paul
          looks a bit surprised by this intrusion. He follows them along the
          corridor. He doesn't even close his front door !
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT
          The camera follows the three persons along the corridor.
                         
                          PAUL
           Well, thank you.
                         
                          CAROL
           I thought I'd-I'd give you, you know, another shot at
           something really delicious. Do you want me to serve that
           for you, because, you know, you should have it while it's
           still fresh.
                         
          The shot becoming a bit wider, we notice that Paul is carrying the
          tray of chocolate mousse that Carol gave him when entering his
          apartment.
                         
                          LARRY
           And you can divide it up and we can all have some.
                         
                          CAROL
           That'd be great. That's a great idea.
                          LARRY
           You'll really like this dessert.
                         
                          PAUL
           Okay, I'll get some plates for it. Wait a minute.
                         
          Paul walks out of the corridor toward his kitchen, and Carol
          rushes into the living-room.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, that'd be really good.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, that's great.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          They both start searching the room frenetically. While Larry looks
          on the desk, Carol searches the rest of the room, even kneeling on
          the floor.
                         
                          CAROL (WHISPERING)
           Come over here. I put'em... um... right here. Right in here
           somewhere. The first... Wait. I should...
           (to Paul, with a much louder voice)
           Uh, how-How are you doing in there ? You need...
                         
          Larry drops things on the floor. With a nervous gesture, Carol
          shushes him.
                         
                          CAROL
           You need any help ?
                         
          The camera pans to the kitchen, where Paul is preparing the
          dessert.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, I'm fine. I'll be right in.
           CAROL (voice over)
           Um... Okay, great.
                         
          The camera pans back to the living room, where Larry is still
          nervously messing things on the desk. Then he starts moving around
          the room, looking for his wife's glasses. Carol puts things back
          in order on the desk. Larry walks to her, and whisper something we
          can't understand.
                         
           LARRY (to Paul, with a louder voice)
           Are you okay ? Can-can-can-can we do anything for you ?
                         
           PAUL (voice over from the kitchen)
           Coffee or tea ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Tea. It's what... I'd like to have some tea.
                         
          Paul walks into the room, with a pair of glasses in his hand.
                         
                          PAUL
           You know, I found your glasses.
                         
                          CAROL
           Mine ?
                         
                          PAUL
           These are yours, aren't they ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes.
                         
                          LARRY
           No.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh, no. Yeah. Uh... No no no no no. They... They... Oh,
           God.
                         
          Carol and Larry both look very nervous. Carol takes the glasses
          from Paul's hand.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, those aren't yours. These are the same, actually.
           They are, aren't they ? These-These-These ones, are.
                         
                          CAROL
           They are actually... They're mine. Honey, they're mine.
           I... You know what happened ? I think the other night, I
           must have left them here. It's the strangest thing.
                         
                          PAUL
           Did you ? I didn't notice that.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no. Yeah. I know. Because, remember, you were saying
           that you thought that I left them at your mother's house ?
                         
          Carol and Larry both look very embarrassed. Paul looks at them
          with a slight surprised eye.
                         
                          LARRY
           At your mother's house.
                         
                          CAROL
           That's right. Of course, so...
                         
          She turns toward Paul, who has remained very calm.
                         
                          PAUL
           That mousse looks fabulous.
                         
                          CAROL
           Anyway, it's so good. I love mousse.
                         
                          PAUL
           Thank you very much.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, listen, are you looking forward to going snorkeling in
           the Caribbean ?
                          PAUL
           Very much. Very much.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh uh.
                         
                          PAUL
           That's funny. I found those glasses under my bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           That's because I must have dropped them and they probably
           got kicked under.
                         
                          LARRY
           Kicked under, right, because what she'll do, she'll drop...
                         
                          CAROL
           They were just...
                         
                          LARRY
           She'll always drop things and she'll kick them all around
           the house.
                         
                          CAROL
           They f...
                         
                          PAUL
           The mousse ?
                         
          He walks away to the kitchen, with a strange smile on his face.
                         
                          LARRY
           She's always-She's always kick...
                         
          Carol looks at Larry with a meaning look, to make him stop
          rambling.
                          CAROL
           Anyway, I'd love to have some mousse.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes, really ? Remember there was the time you kicked the
           mousse under the bed in the house. Remember that ? It
           was...
                         
          Carol walks away toward the kitchen.
                         
                          CAROL
           I remember.
                         
                          LARRY
           It took-took six months to get the...

          Medium full shot of Carol waiting under the awning of a place
          (hotel or club) called the «Five Hundred». She hears a car
          stopping and she looks at the street.
           TED (voice over)
           Hi. I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic's murder.
                         
          Carol runs to the car.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, but where... where are we going ?
                         
           TED (voice over from inside the car)
           I looked up, looked up Helen Moss in the phone book.
                         
          Carol climbs into the car and closes the door.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Yeah.

           So I-it's on Bank Street...
                         
          The car drives away, with Ted's voice fading as the car gets away
          from us.

          building covered with vines. The camera pans away from the
          building to Ted's car parked on the other side of the street
          corner. Medium shot of the inside of the car, through the open

           Maybe he thought that if he, if he, if he divorced her,
           she'd-she'd hit him for a ton of alimony. Or maybe she,
           maybe she controls the family fortune. What do you think of
           that ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, I don't know. Yeah, maybe we're wrong, Ted. Maybe we're
           just, you know... I mean, maybe she died of natural causes,
           like the doctor said and we're just two people with, you
           know, hyperactive imaginations whose lives need a little
           shot of adrenaline.
                         
          Ted looks through the paper food-bag he has brought with him.
                         
                          TED
           Does yours ? I'll tell you, mine needs something.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah? What's that, there ?
                         
                          TED
           You want ? They're jelly doughnuts. You want a jelly
           doughnut ?
                         
           CAROL (with a disgusted tone in her voice)
           Ooh.
                         
                          TED
           Eh ? Come on. No, come on. Come on. You gotta get into it.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay.
                         
                          TED
           Oh my God. Look, look, look, look, look !
                         
          The camera pans to the other corner of the street. Two people, a
          male and a female, are coming out of the brick building.
           CAROL (voice over)
           What ? What ? What ? What ?
                         
           TED (yelling in voice over)
           Helen ! Helen !
           (Back to a normal low voice)
           Duck, duck, duck !
                         
          Neither one of the couple has turned around at the sound of Ted's
          yelling, and they start walking down the street, away from the
          corner.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Ted! God, oh...Oh.
                         
           TED (yelling in voice over)
           Helen !
                         
          The camera pans back to the car, looking through the open window
          on the passenger's side. Carol is hiding under the dashboard. Ted
          is hiding his face with his paper bag, holding a paper cup in the
          other hand.
                          TED
           It's not her.
                         
                          CAROL
           It's not her ?
                         
          She sits back in her seat.
                         
                          TED
           No, it's not her.
                         
          Carol laughs.
                         
                          TED
           What...
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God, you really have this worked out, don't you ?
                         
          She keeps on laughing. Ted starts laughing too.
                         
          Slightly later. It is raining. It is still the same medium shot
          through the passenger's window, but the window is now closed, with
          the rain pouring on the window-pane.
                         
                          TED
           I figured she'd come out and go to work, you know ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Maybe she doesn't work. Maybe she's like... you and she has
           writers hours.
                         
                          TED
           I'm writing a play about something that happened to you and
           me.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. Oh, dear. What ?
                         
                          TED
           Remember-Remember that time... you and... you and I and
           Larry and Julie were all on that-that eating tour of
           France ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.
                         
                          TED
           And they, and then they wandered off and they forgot to
           pick us up ? You remember ? We had to share that bed-and-
           breakfast place.
                         
                          CAROL
           Right. Do you remember those wonderful cottages ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          CAROL
           And I remember... that we shared a bedroom together,
           right ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, but not a bed.
                         
          The camera pans away from the car to the other corner of the
          street. Someone is coming out of the brick building. It is
          apparently a male wearing white pants. He opens an umbrella.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           No, not a... Well, God. You were too gentlemanly to suggest
           that.
                         
                          TED
           Well, it's not... Not that I didn't think of it.
                         
          The camera follows the man with white pants, while he is crossing
          the street on the other side of the street from the car.
                         
                          CAROL
           No. Well, I knew what was going on in your mind... because
           of the way you kept plying me with Chateau Margaux,
           remember ?
                         
          The camera is back behind the passenger's window of the car.
          Though the car-windows, we see the white-pants-man walking on the
          sidewalk on the other side of the street. Ted and Carol do not
          seem to notice him at all.
                         
                          TED
           It could have been our little secret, then you passed out.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, you... Yeah, God. It seems like a long time ago,
           doesn't it ?
                         
                          TED
           Not that long ago.
                         
          Slightly later. The rain has stopped. Same shot through the
          passenger's window of the car, but the window is now open again.
                         
          A long pause. Ted and Carol seem to be both lost them in their own
          thoughts. Then Ted gives a look outside and comes back to
          attention.
                         
                          TED
           Look, look, look, look.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, what ?
                         
          The camera pans to the other side of the street. A woman is coming
          out of the brick building.
                         
           TED (yelling in voice over)
           Helen !
           (with a softer voice)
           Duck, duck, duck, duck, duck !
          On the other side of the street, the woman has stopped and is
          looking around her.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, god, yeah. Right.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           She didn't see us. She didn't see us.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           No ? No. That's gotta be her.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           I'll bet it's...
                         
          The woman starts walking again on the sidewalk.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Are you sure ?
                         
           TED (voice over)
           I mean, she answered to Helen.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           She answers to... She's pretty.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Yeah, I'll say.
                         
          The woman has reached the corner of the street and she lifts her
          arm.
           CAROL (voice over)
           She's... What is she doing ? She's getting a...
                         
           TED (voice over)
           She's getting a cab.
          A yellow cab stops near the woman.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Okay, okay. Hold on.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Keep-Keep down.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Okay, don't worry. Don't worry.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           I'm gonna follow her.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           All right.
                         
          The woman opens the cab door and climbs into it.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot of a street covered with a metal structure. We could be
          under a commuter train bridge. The yellow cab is driving toward
          us. The cab stops at the corner of the street with another street.
          The woman comes out of the cab, and walks away on the sidewalk of
          the other street. The camera pans back to the first street and we
          see Ted's car coming toward us. The camera stops at the corner of
          the street and Carol walks out of the car. She runs in the
          direction of Helen, and waves Ted to join her. The camera pans to
          the end of the street, which actually is a dead end street with
          the back door of a movie house. The woman enters the movie house.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot of a door leading to an emergency stair way. Helen,
          the woman we just saw coming out of the yellow cab, is coming down
          the steps and through the door. She is blonde, young and pretty.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Watch your step. It's very steep. Be careful.
                         
          Behind Helen, Paul is coming out of the stairway. Helen has
          stopped to look around her.
                         
                          HELEN
           Oh, this is beautiful.
                         
                          PAUL
           Isn't it ?
                         
                          HELEN
           Yeah.
                         
          The camera pans away from the couple toward the main hall of the
          movie house. It is an old-fashioned movie house, with red velvet
          seats, and a carved balcony.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Well, we only show revivals now. This week, we have Fred
           Astaire. Next week, we have an Orson Welles festival.

           Oh, yeah ?
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Yeah, it'll be about the last thing we do before we start
           renovating.
                         
          The camera keeps on panning around the room.
                         
           HELEN (voice over)
           Mm. Oh, Paul, I...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Oh, come on, there's nobody around.
                         
          We hear moaning and kissing sounds.
                         
           HELEN (voice over)
           I-I...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Come on.
                         
           HELEN (voice over)

          Full shot of the backstage behind the screen. In a corner, a
          stairway going to the top of the backstage. Half-hidden on the
          stairway, Carol and Ted.
                         
           HELEN (voice over)
           I've never been behind a movie screen before like this.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Strange, isn't it ?
                         
           HELEN (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Used to be a first-run house when the neighborhood was
           better.
                         
          The camera pans to the back of the screen, in front of which Paul
          and Helen are standing.
                         
                          HELEN
           Oh.
                         
                          PAUL
           Beautiful, huh ? Look around.
                         
                          HELEN
           All these mirrors.
                         
          The camera pans around the room, where a lot of huge mirrors are
          stacked.
                          PAUL
           Huh ? Well, it used to be all mirrors, and it was quite
           beautiful.
                         
          The camera tilts down to give us a closer shot on the mirrors.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           I'm having all this broken glass replaced as we go along
           with this renovation. You know, they used to have stage
           shows, here. Now, of course, we only show old movies.
                         
          The camera tilts back up on Paul and Helen.
                         
                          HELEN
           It has such a lonely feeling.
                         
                          PAUL
           That's because I'm the only one here. And my assistant,
           Mrs. Dalton. I'm gonna have this place fixed up, then I'm
           gonna sell it. The money's gonna come in handy.
                          HELEN
           It sure will.
                         
          Paul looks around, a bit worried.
                         
                          PAUL
           What's that noise ?
                         
                          HELEN
           Where ?
                         
          The camera pans to the other side of the room, where a middle-aged
          woman with red curly hair has just entered. She is Gladys Dalton,
          Paul's assistant. She is walking with the help of a cane.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Oh, Mrs. Dalton. I didn't know you were here so early.
                         
                          GLADYS
           Oh, uh, I-I didn't know whether an-anyone was here. I-I'm
           sorry. I-I-I heard the noise and I thought...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           It's quite all right.
                         
                          GLADYS
           But, but, uh...
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           It's quite all right.
                         
                          GLADYS
           I apologize.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Quite all right.
                         
                          GLADYS
           All right.
                         
          Gladys Dalton starts going out of the room and the camera tilts up
          on the stairway, on which Ted and Carol are still hiding.
                         
           HELEN (voice over)
           I'd love to really get an acting job. I had it with this
           modeling.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           Maybe you won't have to work at all.
                         
          Ted and Carol are moving away from the stairway, which remains
          empty.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Close shot on the clock on the wall : the time is just after one
          o'clock. The room is completely dark and the clock is the only
          source of light. The camera pans to the bed and on Carol, sound
          asleep. We hear a noise, like an object dropping down. Carol
          instantly wakes up. She gets up and the camera pans to Larry,
          still asleep. He eventually wakes up, moves around in the bed,
          takes his glasses from the night-table and put them on his nose.
                         
           CAROL (whispering in voice over)
           Oh, my God.
                         
          Slowly Larry gets out of the bed.
                         
                          LARRY
           What's the matter ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Larry, come with me, okay ?
                         
          Larry starts walking along the corridor.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Geez, I was...
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Come on.
                         
                          LARRY
           I was fast asleep. I was dreaming of round card girls.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Larry has reached the front hall. Carol is looking through the
          peephole of the front door.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay. Uh, it looks like he's gone. Yeah. Yeah. He's gone.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Christ. Not that again. Please, you know...
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen, Larry. I want to take another look around his
           apartment. Yeah.
                         
          Carol walks along the corridor toward the bedroom. Larry follows
          her.
                         
                          LARRY
           What are you talking about ? Where're you going ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen.
                         
                          LARRY
           It's-It's one o'clock in the morn...
                         
                          CAROL
           He'll never be back, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ? What ?
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                          CAROL
           No, he's not coming back. Not for at least an hour, an hour
           and a half.
                         
                          LARRY
           What-What're you doing ? You got his key ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           You're kidding. What are you talking about ? You can't
           do... Why... because you-you followed him to the movie
           house, you-you said there was nothing happening.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, wait a minute, look, he was with this young model type,
           and they were talking about money.
                         
          Carol is putting her shoes on.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, so what ? That's the...
                         
                          CAROL
           So, that's the motive.
                         
                          LARRY
           What... Hey, listen to me. Come here.
                         
                          CAROL
           What are you talking about ?
                         
          Carol walks back through the corridor toward the front hall. Larry
          follows her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come here. Wait a minute. Come here. Look, look.
                          CAROL
           Come here. What do you mean, Larry ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I've been thinking about you.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
                          CAROL
           What do you mean ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I think you gotta see... I gotta... You gotta, you gotta go
           back to your shrink.
                         
                          CAROL
           What do you m...
                         
                          LARRY
           I want you to see Doctor Ballard again.
                          CAROL
           Huh ? Larry, I went for two years.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm s... Yeah. I know. But you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Just come... come on.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know how General Motors will recall defective cars ?
           Well, you gotta go in for a tune-up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, we'll be in and out in five minutes.
                         
                          LARRY
           You got... No. No.
                         
                          CAROL
           Five. Only five.
                         
                          LARRY
           I... What... I'm telling you, I'm your husband. I command
           you to sleep !
                         
          He points to the bedroom.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, I didn't...
                         
                          LARRY
           Sleep ! I command it !
                         
                          CAROL
           No, I...
                         
                          LARRY
           I command it ! Sleep !
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, all I can tell you is, if this had been a few years
           ago, you would have been doing the same thing. Because if
           you recall, we solved a mystery. Yep, we solved a mystery
           once. Remember ? It was the-it was the noises in the attic
           mystery.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, yes. The country house. The bluebird. I know.
                         
                          CAROL
           That's right. So...
                         
                          LARRY
           But that, though, was a sweet mystery. This is murder.
                         
                          CAROL
           This... Wh... You agree, right ? It's murder, Larry ? So,
           I'm right.
          She opens the front door and walks out of the apartment.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, I... Yeah, look, no, I-I forbid you ! I forbid you to
           go! It's a-a... I'm forbidding ! Is that what you do when I
           forbid you ? If-If that's what you... I'm not going to be
           forbidding you a lot, if you do...
                         
                         
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the landing. Carol is walking rapidly toward us and
          Paul's apartment. Larry walks behind her. Carol takes Paul's key
          out of her pocket and tries to open the front door. But she takes
          the wrong key on the keyring.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, damn it.
                         
          Larry takes her by the shoulders.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't do this. We should be asleep, now, in one of our many
           cuddling positions.
                         
                          CAROL
           Please, stop it, will you ? Please, be quiet, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           This is wrong.
                         
                          CAROL
           Be quiet. You're gonna wake up the neighbors, okay ? Okay,
           I got it. I got it.
                         
          She opens the door.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Full shot of the front door, seen from the living room. A small
          lamp is still lit on a low table. The door opens and Carol walks
          in, followed by Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           This is no good. I promise you, this could only lead to
           great unhappiness.
                         
                          CAROL
           Listen, Larry... Relax, okay ?
                         
          She closes the front door.
                         
                          LARRY
           Pl... I can't relax. How can I relax ? I'm in a strange
           man's apartment in my, in my T-shirt and-and pajamas.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, don't worry about it. All right, now Ted told me to try
           something here... Yeah.
          She rests her hands on the telephone, which is next to the lamp.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, Ted told you ? Who... Ted ? Ted ? What is
           he, your mentor ?
                         
          The camera zooms to a close shot on the telephone. Carol picks it
          up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Um, «Last number dialed».
                         
          The camera zooms backward to Carol with the phone handset to her
          ear.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ted is a sick schmuck. He's-He's home, and we're in...
                         
                          CAROL
           Just be quiet for a second, all right ?
                         
          She listens to the phone.
                         
                          CAROL
           Shhh !
                         
                          LARRY
           I mean, I'm... What if he comes back ? I'm... My heart
           is....
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry.
                         
           MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE
           Waldron.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh, who ?
           MALE VOICE OVER FROM THE PHONE
           Who is this ? Who do you want ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Um, who's this ?
                         
          She puts her hand on the phone microphone and turns toward Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           Do you know anybody named Waldron ? Waldron ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Hang the phone up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Just be quiet. Okay, wait.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hang the phone up, now.
                         
          She puts the phone handset back to her ear.
                          CAROL
           Oh, great. Now they-they hung up on us.
                         
                          LARRY
           Good, good.
                         
          He takes the handset from her hand and slams it down.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, great.
                         
                          LARRY
           Let's get out. I wanna go home. I want to go back to bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, just let me think for a second, now. Waldron, right ?
           Helen Moss. Okay. He used the name Tom, right ? So, Tom
           Waldron. We gotta run a check on that.
                         
                          LARRY
           Run a check on it ? What, do you want to beat it down to
           the morgue ? You got all the jargon.
                         
                          CAROL
           Come on.
                         
          She walks away from the phone table.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where are you going ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Right.
                         
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Carol enters the bedroom, followed by Larry.
                          LARRY
           I'm not a night person. I don't wanna be... What are you...
           I don't know what I'm looking for.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, oh, wait. Look.
                         
          She starts looking through the mail scattered on a table.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ? What do you wanna do, go through the guy's mail ?
           This is insane.
                         
          He starts looking through the mail.
                         
                          CAROL
           What do you mean ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, my...
          As he takes some more letters, Larry hits a small porcelain
          statuette, and drops it on the floor, where it breaks. He bends
          down to pick up the debris.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus. Oh, Christ !
                         
                          CAROL
           What are you do... Well, just... Clean it up, Larry. Clean
           it up.
                         
          Larry stands up.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, clean it up ? What am I gonna do,
           vacuum ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Put it under the rug, or something like that, okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't. It's a wall-to-wall carpet. I broke his-his-his-
           his... porcelain...
                         
          He looks at the porcelain pieces in his hands.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well then glue it. Glue it back to...
                         
          She moves around the room.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, glue it ? What are you talking about ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, look. Look.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Look.
                         
          She shows him a pair of gloves she just picked up on a low table.
                         
                          LARRY
           So what ? Gloves. I have gloves. They keep my fingers warm.
                         
                          CAROL
           So ? I know. I know, but you keep yours out on the bureau
           in this kind of weather ? Uh ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Let's get out of here, because this is a...
                         
                          CAROL
           I think something's very strange, here. I mean, he left
           these out and ready. I think the whole thing is really
           sinister.
                          LARRY
           It's eye of the beholder. What you have... you've got to go
           to the eye doctor, get happy glasses.
                         
          He pushes her toward the exit of the room.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Look, I'm gonna take the pieces with us, and we'll-we'll
           get rid of them.
                         
          NEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot of the famous entrance of the club 21, with the line
          of painted cast iron lawn jockey statues which adorns the balcony
          above the entrance. The camera zooms backward to give a full shot
          of the entrance of the club.
                         
          NEW-YORK - CLUB TWENTY-ONE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot on the lobby of the club. On the right, a counter with
          an attendant behind the counter. Facing us the entrance of the
          main room. Carol, Larry, and their son Nick, are coming out of the
          room. Nick must be in his early twenties.
                         
                          CAROL
           So, how did you like your birthday cake, Nick ?
                         
                          NICK
           I loved it, I...
                         
                          CAROL
           I know.
                         
                          NICK
           I loved... But then again, I love chocolate anything, so...
          The camera moves around the three people as they walk toward the
          cloakroom.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know.
                         
                          LARRY
           Right.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. What-What-What are you laughing about ?
                         
                          NICK
           Well, I...
                         
                          LARRY
           If only he could stay in town-If only could stay in town
           just a couple of more hours.
                         
                          NICK
           I know. I was going to, but I...
                          CAROL
           Well, what about that ?
                         
                          NICK
           They're working us so hard at school. I can't.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh.
                         
          They've stopped in front of the cloakroom.
                         
                          NICK
           I gotta get right back.
                         
                          CAROL
           Really.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm gonna take him to Brooks Brothers for his present. And-
           And-And, uh...
                         
                          NICK
           Brooks Brothers. Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Your mother's going to a wine-tasting.
                         
                          CAROL
           You're going to get something from Brooks Brothers ?
                         
                          NICK
           Yeah. A sweater.
                         
                          LARRY
           She's going to a wine-tasting. Can you believe that ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, if I'm going to be a restaurant owner, I should know
           something about wines. Don't you... Larry ?
                         
          Larry walks across the lobby, because he has seen someone he knows
          in the sitting-room. He waves his hand and comes back to his wife
          and his son.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hi. Hey, I want you to meet somebody.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ?
                         
          The camera pans around, to show us Marcia crossing the sitting-
          room.
                         
                          LARRY
           I want you to meet somebody. This is, this is...
                         
                          MARCIA
           Hi, Larry.
                          LARRY
           Hi. How are you ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Good. How are you doing ?
                         
                          LARRY
           This is my wife.
                         
          Marcia has reached the lobby.
                         
                          CAROL
           Honey, I'm here. I'm right o...
                         
                          LARRY
           You snuck around.
                         
                          CAROL
           Carol. Remember me ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. This is Marcia Fox.
                         
          The two women shake hands.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, hi.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Hi.
                         
                          LARRY
           My son Nick. He's in town on, uh...
                         
                          MARCIA
           Good to see you.
                         
                          LARRY
           It's his birthday, so we took him to Twenty-One.
                         
          Marcia shakes hands with Nick.
                         
                          NICK
           Nick. How are you doing ?
                         
                          LARRY
           It's a tradition we have in the family.
                         
                          MARCIA
           That's great. Oh, your friend called me. He's taking me to
           dinner in New Jersey next week. Some mafia joint.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, I fixed her up with Ted. He's going to take her...
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, you did.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. That place that we ate at.
                          CAROL
           Well, very nice. That's lovely.
                         
                          LARRY
           He's a lot of fun. You'll have a very good time.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Great. Great.
                         
                          LARRY
           That's great. So.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, good to see you. Good to see you.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, you too.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Take care.
                         
                          CAROL
           Goodbye.
                         
          Marcia walks away.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, it's great. She'll have a great time.
                         
                          CAROL
           So, that's Marcia Fox, huh ?
                         
                          LARRY
           S-So, what are you making a face for ? She's great.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, do you think she's Ted's type ? Is that...
                          LARRY
           Ted's type ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
          Larry gives his ticket to the cloakroom attendant, whom we don't
          see.
                         
                          LARRY
           She's anybody's type. She's brilliant, she's talented.
           Yeah. I gave you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Thank you.
                         
          Larry gives her purse to Carol.
                         
                          LARRY
           You get your bag.
                          CAROL
           You know, your pupils are dilating.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, she's dangerously sexual.
                         
          They start walking toward the entrance of the club.
                         
                          CAROL
           I just wanted to tell you that.
                         
                          LARRY
           Let me tell you... Listen, when you go to the wine-tasting,
           honey...
                         
                          CAROL
           I see.
                         
                          LARRY
           Getting back to real life, spit it out. Okay ? When you
           drink...
                         
                          NICK
           Yeah. Don't drink too much, Mom.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, spit... And spit it out.
                         
                          CAROL
           What do you mean ? Nick.
                         
                          LARRY
           They spit it out at a wine-tasting, you know what I mean ?
           Because, yeah. I don't want you to be lying on the bathroom
           floor with your head by the bowl tonight, you know ?
                         
          They walk out of the club.
          NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          This is very nice lounge in New-York, very tastefully decorated.
          It looks like one of those old English Club in London. Beautiful
          paintings on the walls, and even stained glasses on the windows.
                         
          This is where the wine-tasting is taking place. The camera pans
          around the room. We see people talking while holding wine-glasses.
          We hear Ted and Carol's conversation without seeing them yet.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           That Mouton 45. That was...
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Didn't you love it ?
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Oh, that was-was like, sublime, you know ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah.
           TED (voice over)
           And the inexpensive Spanish one. Wasn't that... wasn't that
           a nice surprise ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           It was very, very...
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Wasn't that great ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Look at these paintings. Look at this.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           So, uh...
                         
          The camera has reached Ted and Carol and follows them walking in
          the room.
                         
                          TED
           I love the blue in that.
                         
                          CAROL
           So, Larry fixed you up with Marcia Fox, huh ? His, uh...
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, yeah, well, you know. He's...
                         
                          CAROL
           His favorite writer.
                         
                          TED
           He says she's wonderful, and I'm...
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh.
                         
                          TED
           I'm trying to do everything I can to get out and meet
           people, you know.
                         
                          CAROL
           Sure.
                         
          We now get a medium shot of Carol and Ted walking toward us.
                         
                          TED
           I'm-I'm not looking forward to this.
                         
                          CAROL
           So, you're taking her to Vincent's out in Jersey ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          CAROL
           Is that what you're...
                          TED
           I-I guess. She's not my first choice.
                         
                          CAROL
           No ? God, look at this! Oh, that park is so beautiful.
                         
          They have reach a large window, where they can get a view of the
          park on the other side of the street.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, it's great. Of course, I can't have my first choice.
                         
                          CAROL
           No ?
                         
                          TED
           I'm getting drunk. I don't know what I'm saying.
                         
          He sits down. She sits down on the sofa besides him. Behind them,
          you see the park through the windows.
                         
                          CAROL
           You're getting... So am I. I don't know about this.
                         
          Ted looks at his watch.
                         
                          TED
           I'm gonna be late for my shrink. I've got a...
                         
                          CAROL
           You've got to go, huh ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay.
                          TED
           Well, you know, you would be my first choice.
                         
                          CAROL
           Me, huh ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
          Carol laughs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well. Oh, boy.
                         
                          TED
           Well, you... Can I give you a lift ? Do you, uh, I'm gonna
           go east. Do you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Thanks. No, I-I think I'll stick around, I need to think. I
           need my... I feel a little, you know, tipsy.
                          TED
           I didn't offend you by what I said, did I ?
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You didn't offend
           me, no, I was very, uh, flattered by this, Ted. Flattered.
           Well, anyway.
                         
                          TED
           See you later.
                         
          He stands up and bumps into a low table in front of the sofa.
                         
                          CAROL
           See you. Oops, careful. Whoops.
                         
                          TED
           Sorry. Excuse me.
                         
                          CAROL
           Excuse me.
                         
          Carol looks at him walking away with a strange expression in her
          eyes.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium tracking shot of Ted walking on the sidewalk, coming from
          the lounge and toward us.
                         
          Medium low-angle shot of one of the window of the lounge, seen
          from the street. This shot is low-angled because the lounge is
          located slightly above street level. Carol is seated in front of
          the window, looking very pensive. She takes a sip of her glass of
          wine. She looks absently though the window.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A LOUNGE - INTERIOR DAY
          The street seen through the window, next to which Carol is seated,
          but we don't actually see Carol. We see a big car, followed by a
          bus. The camera zooms on the bus. Through one of the bus windows,
          we see a woman, seated inside the bus. And this woman looks very
          much like the deceased Lilian, Paul's wife.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Close shot on the window, in front of which Carol is seated. She
          looks at the passing bus, with a wide open mouth, and a surprised,
          almost frightened, expression on her face. She stands up a little
          and then sits back.

          Full view of the room. In the background, Carol, still seated by
          the window. She stands up, picks up her purse, and starts crossing
          the room, bumping into people. She reaches the staircase, and
          walks downstairs.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY
          Full view on the entrance of the lounge. Carol is walking rapidly
          down the stairs leading to the entrance. She reaches the sidewalk,
          and looks around her for the bus. She walks away from the lounge
          and toward us, with the camera on a tracking shot in front of her.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot of Larry working in the kitchen, putting things away
          in the cupboards. Behind him, we see the front hall. The front
          door opens and Carol walks in.
                         
                          LARRY
           I got a great sweater at Brooks Brothers' today for Nick,
           today.
                         
          Carols closes the door and leans on the wall. But Larry doesn't
          seem to understand that something is wrong with her. He walks away
          to the sitting room. He keeps on talking in voice over, while
          Carol is still leaning on the wall of the front hall.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Really beautiful. It's cashmere. Very expensive. The kid
           looked so handsome in it, though. Also, I decided I'd cook
           dinner tonight. My one dish tuna casserole.
                         
          Larry comes back in the kitchen and looks at his wife, but still
          doesn't seem to notice that something is wrong. We follow Larry
          into the sitting-room.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is setting the table for dinner
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Well, no wonder he had her cremated.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Mrs. House.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus. You're not about Mrs. House again. I thought
           we'd have a light dinner, you know, because we had a rich
           lunch at Twenty-One, I thought.
                         
          The camera pans to Carol standing at the entrance of the room and
          leaning on the wall
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I just saw Mrs. House.
           LARRY (voice over)
           What are you talking about ? The ashes ?
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, no. A bus. It passed me, and she was on it.
                         
          Larry joins Carol.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, the dead woman passed you on a bus ? Which bus was
           this, the bus to heaven ?
                         
          Larry walks away toward the kitchen. Carol follows him.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, but I'm not, I'm not joking. I mean, I'm telling you
           something. I'm telling you, I really saw her. I actually
           saw her.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is checking his cooking.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
          Larry takes two wine-glasses out of the sink.
                         
                          LARRY
           You want to lie down for a while ? We'll put a cold
           compress on your head, or a hot compress on your back,
           or...
                         
                          CAROL
           No, Larry, you know, I was at the wine-tasting, right ? And
           I was just... I was sitting at, you know, a bay window. I-I
           happened to look out. A bus passed, and she was on it,
           Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Remember I said to you ? Yes, remember I said to you, spit
           it out ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I...
                         
                          LARRY
           I said don't drink it. You said you were going to a wine-
           tasting ?
                         
                          CAROL
           But ?
                         
                          LARRY
           You said you were going to taste wine all afternoon ? I
           said spit it out ?
                          CAROL
           Yeah...
                         
                          LARRY
           I said don't swallow it ? You swallowed it. And that's why
           you're this way.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. I know. Okay. I-I... Yeah. I had a few drinks, but
           it's-it's not... I mean, I saw her.
                         
          Larry puts the glasses away on the dinner table.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I 'm sure you saw her.
                         
                          CAROL
           I ...
                         
                          LARRY
           How could you see her ? She's dead. Not only is she dead,
           she's been cremated. It's not even Halloween.
                         
          They walk into the sitting-room.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - SITTING-ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay. Are you telling me that you... That, that, that, that
           you... That I didn't see her ? Is that what you're saying ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I think it's a pretty fair assumption that if a person is
           dead, they don't suddenly turn up in the New York City
           transit system.
                         
                          CAROL
           I just... I just don't know what's happening, Larry. I-I-I
           don't know what's going on.
                         
                          LARRY
           What's going on ?
                         
                          CAROL
           What's... yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Let me put it this way : total psychotic breakdown. Okay ?
           Is that enough ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I...
                         
                          LARRY
           Maybe, look. Maybe she's a twin. That's possible. Now
           forget this.
                         
                          CAROL
           Why ?
                          LARRY
           Taste my tuna casserole. Tell me if I put in too much hot
           fudge.
                         
          He opens the dish he had put earlier on the table.
                         
                          CAROL
           Honey, you're getting so close-minded these days. I just...
                         
          The phone rings.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh. Oh, God.
                         
          She picks up the phone from the wall. Larry sits at the table.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hallo ? Ted. Ted.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Ted. Ted.
                         
                          CAROL
           Ted, you're not going to believe this, but, Ted, I saw Mrs.
           House. Yes, Mrs. House. Yeah. Mrs... the murdered woman.
           That's right.
                         
          Larry opens the red wine bottle and pours some wine in his glass.
                         
                          LARRY
           She wasn't murdered. It was a coronary. It was a coronary,
           folks. It was a coronary. She wasn't murdered. I don't know
           what they're talking about.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. No, I'm sure. I'm sure I saw her. She was on a bus,
           you know ? I mean, I-I saw her just moments after you left.
           I was looking out the...
          Larry puts the cork back on the bottle.
                         
                          LARRY
           He was at the wine tasting, too. Sure, why not.
                         
                          CAROL
           Would you ?
                         
                          LARRY
           They're both at the wine tasting.
                         
                          CAROL
           Would you really ? Oh, that would be so great. You'd just
           run a check on Paul and Lillian House.
                         
          Larry stands up and walks toward Carol.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't run a check. Don't run a check.
                         
          He takes the phone from Carol's hand.
                          CAROL
           What are you talking...
                         
                          LARRY
           Stop.
                         
                          CAROL
           What are you doing ? I mean...
                         
          Larry talks to Ted on the phone.
                         
                          LARRY
           Listen, could you call back later, because my marriage is
           falling apart.
                         
          He puts the phone down.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, what are you... But, what ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Forget it. Will you ? If you're gonna have an affair with
           the guy, you don't need a murder to do it.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm telling you, I saw Mrs. House.
                         
          Larry sits back at the table.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes, I know, on the bus, the dead persons' bus. No car
           fare.
                         
                          CAROL
           I s...Okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           Now, sit down. Let's...
                         
                          CAROL
           Now look. Just... I can tell you. I can show you the exact
           spot, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I'm not going to see the exact spot.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh ? What about lunch ? Tomorrow ?
                         
                          LARRY
           No, I've got a business lunch tomorrow. I got...
                         
                          CAROL
           On... on your, on your lunch hour ?
                         
                          LARRY
           No, I got a business lunch. I'm not interested.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. I'm telling you... I mean, this is such a shock.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hm ? I'm not interested. Come on, will you...
                         
          She walks away toward the front hall.
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, I'm telling you, I'm just vibrating from this. I
           mean, I saw this woman.
                         
                          LARRY
           Will you eat something ? We've got tickets to the theatre.
                         
          Carol comes back into the room.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ? Wh...I'm not going to the theatre.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           What do you mean you're not go... We've been holding onto
           these tickets for two months, now.
                         
          Carol walks again to the front hall and comes back toward the
          sitting room, via the kitchen.
                         
                          CAROL
           Do you comprehend the enormity of what I'm telling you,
           Larry ? Do you compr...
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           If you got a big story, tell it to the Police. Don't tell
           it to me.
                         
                          CAROL
           What am I going to say to them ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Tell them your story. Tell them this whole cockamamie
           story.
                         
                          CAROL
           What story ? I don't have a story. I mean, I got nothing.
           Unless... Oh !
                         
                          LARRY
           That's right. That's right, you've got nothing.
                         
                          CAROL
           Unless... Unless I locate her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, okay, good. Now, will you sit down because we're
           going to the theater. I don't care what you say.
                         
          She takes a drink on water in the kitchen.
                         
          LARRY'S BUILDING - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot of Larry and Carol coming out of the lift. They cross
          the lobby. Jack, the caretaker of the building in standing near
          the entrance of the building.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jack ? Jack ? You-you were there when Mrs. House died,
           right? You saw her ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Right. Yeah. You saw her lying there, right ?
                         
                          JACK
           Yes, she was lying on the floor.
                         
                          CAROL
           You said... Yeah, but... but you're, you-re sure it was
           her, right ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, he said it was lying on the floor. Right. Right. You
           know, I... He's sure. He's sure. He's sure.
                         
                          JACK
           She was in that bag. Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           My-My-My wife's been having some bad dreams, and she
           doesn't know what she's talking about.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, look. Yeah, yeah.
                         
          Larry gives some banknotes to Jack.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, this is, this is for all the times I call you to fix
           the faucet, and you show up six months late.
                         
                          JACK
           Thanks.
                         
          THEATER - AUDIENCE HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the audience watching the show. We hear music. In the
          forefront, Carol and Larry. Larry is taping his chin with the
          program. Carol turns toward Larry and starts whispering.
                         
                          CAROL
           The super is a drunk. I know, but, we've seen him smelling
           of Jack Daniel's, remember ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, but...
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, I know he didn't see Mrs. House, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           If she's a twin, it's a different story. But you don't seem
           to feel she is, so...
                          CAROL
           Well, I don't know. Oh, I know. Unless he's in on it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Who's in on it ? The super ? The super can't change a fuse.
                         
          The lady, sitting next to Larry, just gave the couple a bad look,
          and Carol taps on Larry's arm.
                         
                          CAROL
           Shh !... Shh !...
                         
          A short pause.
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, she...
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, she's alive. And my question is, who was in that bag.
           I mean, somebody...
                         
                          LARRY
           She's not alive, unless she's a twin. Okay ? Now keep
           quiet...
                         
                          CAROL
           Look, somebody... Somebody got cremated, Larry. Somebody.
                         
                          LARRY
           Shut up.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot of Ted and Carol walking toward us in a quiet street.
          Actually it is the street where the wine-tasting lounge is
          located, and, of course, the street where Carol saw the bus with
          Lilian on board of it. They walk near the entrance of the
          «National Arts Club». Ted is holding a small notebook and looking
          at what is has written in it.
                         
                          TED
           Lillian House.
                         
                          CAROL
           Right.
                         
                          TED
           Uh, maiden name, Lillian Beagle. Born in Carlyle,
           Pennsylvania, nineteen-thirty-five. Married Paul Richard
           House.
                         
                          CAROL
           Right, I know.
                         
                          TED
           She was not a twin. Had an older sister who...
                          CAROL
           So goes Larry's theory.
                         
                          TED
           Uh, went to England twenty years ago, and an older brother
           who died in nineteen-eighty-seven.
                         
          Carol stops in front of the building next to the «National Arts
          Club». It is the building where they had the wine-tasting session
          the day before.
                         
                          CAROL
           Right here. This is it.
                         
                          TED
           This is where we were.
                         
          The camera tilts up to show the window behind which Carol was
          sitting the day before.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           This is where we were. I know. And I was sitting right
           here, after you left.
                         
          The camera tilts back down to Ted and Carol.
                         
                          TED
           Right.
                         
                          CAROL
           And I was having a glass of, you kn-you know, wine, and I
           looked out the window, and-and I saw the... right here.
                         
          Carol shows Ted the spot where she saw the bus.
                         
                          TED
           You saw her after I left ?
                          CAROL
           Yes, I saw... her on a bus. It was passing. You... It was,
           like.
                         
          She walks in the middle of the street.
                         
                          TED
           Wait a minute. Are you... You're absolutely sure you saw
           her ? You saw her face ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm positive I-I saw her.
                         
          A car is honking. Carol, still standing in the middle of the
          street, moves out of the way of the car.
                         
                          CAROL
           Whoo !... Excuse me. I-I'm telling you, Ted.
                         
          Ted joins Carol in the middle of the street.
                         
                          TED
           What was the number of the bus ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh, I don't know what the number of the bus was, but I know
           that it was heading west to east, so it was... it obviously
           was a cross-town bus.
                         
                          TED
           All right. Okay, look, look. It's a cross-town bus.
                         
          They walk to the sidewalk on the other side of the street, where
          the park is located.
                         
                          CAROL
           Right.
                         
                          TED
           Okay, so look. The end of the line is a few blocks down
           there.
                         
                          CAROL
           So, okay. So, then, it's like...
                         
                          TED
           So, she... She had to get off somewhere... somewhere.
                         
                          CAROL
           Then... Her destination was probably within the next five
           or six blocks.
                         
          They start walking on the sidewalk, going the way where they first
          came from.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, right. So, let's, let's look around. Let's, we, we'll
           see some, you know, uh, like a, like a, you know... clue,
           or something. Or something. Maybe we'll see her. You're
           sure you saw her face ?
                          CAROL
           Don't, don't doubt me, okay ?
                         
                          TED
           Okay, okay, okay. No, no, no, no.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm-I'm not kidding. Look.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A WIDE AVENUE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          This is not a nice area anymore. It is a wide dingy-looking
          avenue, with the nearest buildings very far away and a road bridge
          over the street. And it is raining.
                         
          Long shot of the avenue, with Carol and Ted walking further away.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. Well, I think, you know, I think we've reached the
           end of the line.
                          TED
           I think this is it.
                         
          A bus is coming toward them.
                         
                          CAROL
           Look. The bus.
                         
          The bus slows down.
                         
                          TED
           I don't think... there's noth... Watch out. Watch out.
                         
          Ted pushes Carol so she doesn't get soaked by the bus driving very
          close to the sidewalk and into the pools of rain.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, what ? Oh. Whoo !...
                         
          The bus makes a U-turn on the avenue.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, look. See ? See, he's turning. That's it.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, I know.
                         
                          TED
           That's all there is, here.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, what do you think ?
                         
                          RED
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Do you think we should retrace our steps ?
          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE LOUNGE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          They are back in the same street where the wine-tasting place is
          located.
                         
          Full shot of the park across the street, seen across the thick
          vertical bars of the railings that surround the park. Ted and
          Carol are walking on a lane in the park.
                         
                          TED
           You-you wear a tie with a dress. It's a... It's a very
           special...
                         
          The camera follows Ted and Carol, moving on the other side of the
          railings.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, I don't think it looks good, and I don't even know if
           it looks... I mean, I feel like it'd be to masculine if I
           wore it with a pair of pants.
                          TED
           Oh, it'd look great on you. No, no, just don't wear it with
           pants.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh.
                         
                          TED
           With pants, it's-it's... what ?
                         
          Carol has just stopped walking, and she is looking at something on
          the other side of the railings.
                         
                          CAROL
           Ted, look.
                         
                          TED
           At what ? What ?
                         
          The camera pans around to a reverse angle shot of the other side
          of the street. It stops on a building. On the awning above the
          entrance of the building is written : «Hotel Waldron». The camera
          stops on that shot and doesn't move anymore.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           That hotel.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           What about it?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Well, that's... the Waldron. I mean, I thou... I-I was in
           his apartment, I pressed the number... «last number
           dialed», and...
                         
           TED (voice over)
           You're kidding.
           CAROL (voice over)
           And they answered the phone. And said... Waldron.

          Only two people, Larry and Marcia, are seated at a table behind a
          set of crossed wooden bars, on the other side of which the camera
          is located. Apparently Marcia is teaching Larry how to play poker.
          Marcia wears sunglasses and has a cigarette stuck between her
          lips.
                         
                          MARCIA
           If I get two kings, I take one. Otherwise, I fold.
                         
                          LARRY
           So...
                         
                          MARCIA
           Got it ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I-I never go out. I-I-I-I-I just, I can't take... I
           can't...
                         
          Marcia shuffles the cards.
                          MARCIA
           That's how you wind up on welfare.
                         
          The camera pans away from the two players to another section of
          the restaurant, where a few people are still eating. It looks like
          a very good restaurant, with waiters dressed with white shirt and
          black vest.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           You know, I need the action, for some reason. I-I can't...
           I bet anything. Okay, just...
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Cut ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           No, no, go ahead, I trust you. Lay it on me.
                         
          The camera pans back on Larry and Marcia. This is a different
          shot, with the camera in front of their table. Marcia seems very
          relaxed with the cards in her hands, when Larry seems quite
          nervous. He holds the card very close to his eyes, seeming afraid
          that his partner will look at them.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You seem in a strange mood.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, no. I'm just probably just a little drunk.
                         
                          MARCIA
           On Perrier ?
                         
                          LARRY
           No. What are you talking about ? I had rum cake.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Want any cards ?
                         
          Larry shuffles his cards in his hand, hesitating on his next move.
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, one second. Just let me, let me see, see what I,
           possibilities I got here. Uh, yeah. I'm gonna have, uh...
           I'll have, uh... I'm gonna have four cards.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Four ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
          She gives him his four cards.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Cruising for a bruising.
                         
                          LARRY
           Inside and outside straight.
          Marcia looks at her cards. Larry keeps shuffling his cards very
          nervously.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You're in trouble, now.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, I can't escape the feeling that my-my wife is
           becoming attracted to somebody else... and it's really
           bothering me.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Really.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah. That's why I'm not playing my best. This guy is, you
           know, more adventurous than I am, and for some reason they
           just seem to hit it off. I'm gonna be very lonely if, uh,
           you know, if this happens.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You must love her a lot.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I do. I do.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Um... if you want to hold on to her, you have to make some
           effort. I mean, who's the guy ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Uh, Ted. The guy that I fixed you up with.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Ted.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, we could always switch. Ted gets Carol, I can be your
           date.
                         
                          LARRY
           Maybe-Maybe I should actually make a greater effort with-
           with Carol.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of the entrance of the Waldron Hotel. The pavement is
          wet but it doesn't seem to rain anymore. The camera pans to a car
          parked on the other side of the street a short distance from the
          hotel. This is Larry's car, with Larry seated behind the wheel and
          Carol seated on the passenger's seat. Medium shot of the inside of
          the car, seen through the open window.
                         
                          CAROL
           So, you bored ? I mean...
                          LARRY
           Well, it's more fun than the Wagner opera.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Well, to me, I mean, just... I mean, it's just one of
           the most exciting adventures I've ever been on.
                         
                          LARRY
           Would you rather be here with Ted ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Well-Well, he has a more enthused attitude, Larry. I...
                         
                          LARRY
           More enthused ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, enthused, yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, he's a fun guy. He's a light guy, I'm a heavy guy.
                          CAROL
           Well, I...
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, Ted-Ted would be fun on a scavenger hunt.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, look. I... Larry, you used to be a lot of fun.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, he's the guy you want if you have a really heavy
           scavenger hunt. He's the man.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, well, but, y-you know. You used to...
                         
                          LARRY
           Do you know that this neighborhood was where I first took
           you out on a date when we-we first started going out.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ? I don't know. I don't know. Just for some reason,
           you've gotten so stodgy in your old age, you know ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, you remember there was a movie house right on this
           corner.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, I know. Yes ! Yeah, I remember.
                         
                          LARRY
           Not to change the subject.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, I...
                         
                          LARRY
           I took you to see «Last year at Marienbad» on our first
           date ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, I know. I had to explain it to you for the next six
           months.
                         
                          LARRY
           Who knew they were flashbacks ? You know.
                         
                          CAROL
           Look, Larry. Look. We've got plenty of time to be
           conservative. You know what I'm saying ? Don't you see ?
                         
          The camera starts moving around the car.
                         
                          CAROL
           It's to me, it's like this-this tantalizing plum has just,
           like dropped into our laps. I mean, life is just such a
           dull routine and here we are, right ? I mean, we're on the
           threshold of a genuine mystery. I mean, to me, the whole
           thing is like. It's... Hey, no.
          The camera stops moving on another medium shot, where we still see
          Larry through his open window, but we see Carol only through the
          wet windshield.
                         
                          LARRY
           Are you gonna burst into a song, here ? We're in a car.
                         
                          CAROL
           Just don't make fun of me, okay ? Because I'm open to new
           experiences.
                         
                          LARRY
           Let me ask you a personal question, here.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Did you ever sleep with Ted ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Sleep ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't get nervous. Yeah. Yeah, you guys...
                         
                          CAROL
           What, are you nuts ?
                         
                          LARRY
           We were on an eating tour of France, together.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           You two guys spent an evening, you know, together.
                          CAROL
           Yeah, right. We sp...
                         
                          LARRY
           At that place, you know.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know... Yeah, but what about you ? Remember ? You spent
           the evening with Julie. Am I right ? You spent the night,
           and shared a...
                         
                          LARRY
           That meant absolutely nothing. She hated me. Julie despised
           me.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ?
                         
                          LARRY
           You know that. She-She thought I was a low-life and a wimp
           and a vermin and a roach. Just-Just jump in anytime you
           want to defend me, you know.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, I mean, I'm waiting for you to say something I don't
           agree with, okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Ho-ho ! Hey, you're nailing me... Jesus !...
                         
          He stops smiling because he just saw something in front of his
          car, something we don't yet see, because the camera hasn't moved
          from its position.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh. Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
          The camera starts panning very rapidly toward the entrance of the
          hotel.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Larry, Larry, look. It's her ! I'd say it's her !
                         
          A lady carrying a white open umbrella is entering the hotel.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh my god, it is.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah. You see what I mean ? See, so I was right all along,
           wasn't I ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Can you... Are you sure ? Are you sure ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           I'm positive. Yes.
                         
          The camera starts panning back toward Larry's car.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, my God.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Right ? Right ? I mean, I was...
                         
          Medium shot of Larry and Carol in the car, seen through Larry's
          open window.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm... Jesus, I'm sh...
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. W-Well. Come on.
                         
                          LARRY
           That is her. Are you...
                         CAROL
          Yeah. I know.
                         
                         LARRY
          I told you so.
                         
                         CAROL
          What do you mean, you told me so ? What are you talking
          about ? You're nuts, honey.
                         
                         LARRY
          Oh, Jesus. I'm flabbergasted.
                         
                         CAROL
          Yeah. No, look. You're white. You're completely white.
                         
                         LARRY
          I know. All the blood rushed to my brother.
                         
                         CAROL
          Larry !
                         
                         LARRY
          I don't know what to do.
                         
                         CAROL
          Let's go. Let's get out there. Let's find out what's going
          on.
                         
                         LARRY
          No, I don't want to.
                         
                         CAROL
          Oh, come on. Y-You're not afraid of her, are you ?
                         
                         LARRY
          No, I'm not afraid.
                         CAROL
          You're not afraid of Mrs. House.
                         
                         LARRY
          She's an old woman and I'm a virile male.
                         
                         CAROL
          I know.
                         
                         LARRY
          And yet somehow I am scared. I don't know why. Maybe
          because she's dead. You know ?
                         
                         CAROL
          Let's go. You know, I tell you, I'm gonna break this thing
          wide open.
                         
                         LARRY
          Well, how ? What do you want to do ?
                         
                         CAROL
          I'm... You know, I'm... God, if only Ted were here with us
           now. You know what I'm saying ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, don't give me Ted ! Wh... Let's... Let's... Wh... Let's
           get out of here.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, wait. I got an idea.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I know what we should do. We should get a gift, right ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
          Carol gets out of the car.
                         
                          CAROL
           We'll surprise her. We'll sneak into the hotel. Come on.
                         
                          LARRY
           How ? How ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, no. Come on.
                         
          Larry gets out of the car.
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - LOBBY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          A modern clean lobby, with a very conventional decoration. Medium
          shot of a clerk cleaning the lobby floor with a broom. She is a
          woman in her forties, very casually dressed with a flowered blouse
          and a beige sweater, and with uncombed hair hanging on her
          shoulders.
          The camera pans around toward the street door. Carol enters the
          lobby, followed by Larry. Carol is holding a small present-wrapped
          parcel in her hand and walks toward the clerk.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh, excuse me. Hi.
                         
           HOTEL DAY CLERK
           Hi.
                         
                          CAROL
           Um, we were just wondering. Uh, did you see a woman come
           in ? She was, uh, she was a little woman, about five foot
           three ? She had on a gray sweater ?
                         
           HOTEL DAY CLERK
           Older woman ?
                         
                          LARRY
           And came in with a-with a canvas bag, and an umbrella.
                          CAROL
           Slightly older. Not...
                         
           HOTEL DAY CLERK
           Mrs. Caine ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Mrs. Caine ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Mrs. Caine. Oh, yes. Uh-huh. That's her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Mrs. Caine. Uh-huh.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes.
                         
          Larry takes the parcel from Carol's hand.
                         
                          LARRY
           We-We had a present for her. We're friends. We-We wanted to
           surprise her, because it's her birthday, so-so...
                         
          He gives the parcel back to Carol.
                         
           HOTEL DAY CLERK
           Oh.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, that's right. What room ?
                         
           HOTEL DAY CLERK
           Uh, six-eleven.
                         
                          CAROL
           Six-eleven. Really, thanks a lot.
           HOTEL DAY CLERK
           Okay. Sure.
                         
          Carols walks away, but Larry stays with the clerk. He takes a
          banknote out of his pocket.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, we-we may need some information, while we're here,
           so-so, we just want you to know... I'll take very good care
           of you, if you play ball with us.
                         
          He gives the banknote to the clerk, who seems a bit surprised by
          Larry's attitude and present. She looks at the banknote.
                         
                          LARRY
           What are you making that face for ? He's the father of our
           country.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Will you come on ?
                         
          Larry walks toward Carol, who is waiting for the elevator.
                          LARRY
           I'm coming, I'm coming.
                         
                          CAROL
           Come on. What're you doing ?
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot on the elevator door opening. Carol walks out,
          followed by Larry, who closes the door. Carol starts looking
          around for room numbers. The camera follows them
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay. Um, six-eleven. Six-oh-seven.
                         
          The camera stops at the beginning of a long narrow corridor. Carol
          and Larry walk along the corridor, away from the camera.
                         
                          LARRY
           Huh. Very nice. I love a hotel that's got lots of blue
           powder sprinkled along the baseboard.
                         
                          CAROL
           Six-eleven. Here, Larry. All right.
                         
          They have stopped walking at the end of the corridor, in front of
          a door. Carol knocks on that door.
                         
                          CAROL
           Um, Mrs. House ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Mrs. House ?
                         
          Carol knocks louder on the door, helped by Larry. Under Larry's
          fist, the door opens slowly.
          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium close shot on the door, that opens slowly.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           M-Mrs. House ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Hallo ?
                         
          Carol enters the room, followed by Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hallo ? Mrs. Hou...
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't... I don't...
                         
                          CAROL
           My God, I don't...
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't think she's...
                         
          The camera starts panning around the room, up to the window, then
          starts panning back toward Carol and Larry.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           I don't see her.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           This may not be the right-right place.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Just hold on, Larry. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
                         
          The camera is back on Carol and Larry. Larry is looking inside a
          closet.
                         
                          LARRY
           There's nothing here.
                         
          He closes the closet door. Carol yells.
                         
                          CAROL
           Ahhh ! Larry !
                         
          She runs to the beds and look down on the floor between the two
          twin beds. She drops the parcel on the floor.
                         
                          LARRY
           What's the matter ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God ! Wait a minute !
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus.
                         
          Carol kneels down on the floor, bending on something she just saw
          on the floor. The camera follows her movement and we see a human
          hand resting on the floor, the rest of the body being hidden by
          one of the bed.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God, look ! Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What's the matter ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Hallo ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What-What-What...
                         
                          CAROL
           Mrs...Oh, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           What? What-What's...
          Carol, still kneeling on the floor, straightens up and looks at
          Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           I think she's dead.
                         
                          LARRY
           Dead ? T-T-Try-Try giving her the present.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Oh, my God. Mrs. House ? Mrs. House ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, come on ! Let's get out of here !
                         
                          CAROL
           I think that's it, Larry. I think she's dead !
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on. Let's get out of here.
                         
          He helps Carol to stand up.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm thinking of running the Boston marathon.
                         
          They both start running out of the room.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. Okay, oh God.
                         
                          LARRY
           This woman is forever dying.

          Same shot of the long corridor as before. We see Carol and Larry
          coming out Room 611 and running toward us.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on, come on. Move, move. Adrenaline is leaking out of
           my ears.
                         
          They reach the end of the corridor, and the camera follows them as
          they run around the corner of the hallway.
                         
                          LARRY
           Get down those stairs.
                         
          They don't use the elevator and instead run down the stairs.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, all right.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on, come on. Quickly.
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Long shot of the entrance of the hotel, seen from the other side
          of the street. A blue police car is parked in front of the hotel.
          Two plainclothes police officers and one uniformed policeman are
          talking with Carol and Larry. They both try to explain the
          situation to the police officers. But since they both talk
          together, the police officers have a hard time understanding them.
                         
          While they are talking, the camera zooms forward from a long shot
          to a full shot of the group.
                         
           CAROL (talking together with Larry)
           And then, you see, what happened was I suspected Mr. House,
           right ? He's a... He runs a movie house. But-But then what
           hap... We're sit... I saw her on this bus, right ? And...
           And she has... no place at all. Then we checked anyway. So
           we were just sitting there, just waiting...
                         
           LARRY (talking together with Carol)
           We-We-We were there. She-She was very nervous. So-So we
           were going to the movies, and, and, and we were walking and
           looking around the place. And then suddenly she's a... Her
           hand is on the floor. You could see it on the side of the
           bed. She was lying there, she was sort of... like blue in
           the face. The girl was nervous. I tried to keep calm, as
           best as I could.
                         
          One of the plainclothes police officers stops their talking.
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           There's nobody up there.
                         
                          CAROL
           There's what ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, there's nobody up...
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           There's nobody.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait a minute, wait...
                         
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           There's no body there.
                         
                          CAROL
           We-We saw...
                         
                          LARRY
           We just saw her there. She's lying on the floor.
                         
                          CAROL
           We...
                         
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER (talking to the uniformed policeman)
           Mike, check the basement with...
          He starts climbing the few steps to the entrance of the hotel,
          followed by Carol and Larry. The other police officer remains on
          the sidewalk.
                         
                          LARRY
           She was totally dead.
                         
                          CAROL
           We... She's there.
                         
                          LARRY
           Wait, wait.
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium close shot of an uniformed policeman, different from the
          one we just saw in the street.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           She was right here. She was lying, like, right this-a-way.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Yeah, she was definitely laying here.
                         
          The camera pans from the uniformed policeman to the two police
          officers talking with Carol and Larry in the middle of the room.
          The following dialogue transcript separates what Larry says from
          what Carol says, but, most of the time, they talk together at the
          same time, making it quite difficult for us, or for the police
          officers, to follow their conversation.
                         
                          CAROL
           Because, I mean, she was, she was there, do you
           understand ?
                         
          The camera tilts down on one of the police officers looking under
          the bed.
                          LARRY
           The... Y-Yes. She was... It looked like she was strangled,
           or something. Not-Not that I'm an expert on violent death,
           because I wouldn't know.
                         
                          CAROL
           We're-We're two professional people.
                         
                          LARRY
           Right, I'm a... I-I work at Harper's.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm in publishing.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, that's right, and I'm-I'm looking to start a little
           restaurant, basically French, although international
           cuisine would be fine. Not that I really have a location...
                          LARRY
           Right, she's a fantastic cook. But, uh, I'm against the
           restaurant, myself, but-but she's a wonderful cook.
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           Calm down. Calm down ! Please !
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, just...
                         
                          LARRY
           Look, obviously what happened is, in the time it took you
           guys to respond... somebody came here and removed the body.
           Not that you didn't respond quickly, you know, you were
           here fast. It took-took you three minutes, not-not-not
           counting the half-hour that the operator 911 took to
           understand what I was saying.
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           Nobody is doubting you, okay ? We're going over the whole
           building, all right ?
                         
                          CAROL
           All right.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot of Carol, Larry, the first plainclothes police officer
          and the uniformed policeman we first saw in the street.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh, did you check...
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           Mr. House...
                         
          The second plainclothes police officer joins the group.
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           ...He's been at his place of business all day.
                         
                          LARRY
           Any witnesses ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, b...
                         
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           Uh-huh, backed up and corroborated.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, but you didn't use our names, or anything like that,
           did you ?
                         
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           No, we didn't.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, okay.
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           I don't know. If you think you saw his wife, shouldn't you
           tell him ?
                         
                          CAROL
           No, I'm... No, I mean, he's in some sort of scheme, here.
           It's...
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           We think you should calm down and file a report.
                         
                          CAROL
           It's not... Oh !
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           This way, if anything turns up, we got it on record.
                         
          He gives his business card to Larry.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right.
                         
           FIRST POLICE OFFICER
           Take a card, give us a call, have a good day.
                         
                          CAROL
           Thank you. Thanks very much.
                         
           SECOND POLICE OFFICER
           Bye-bye.
                         
          The two police officers walk away with the uniformed policeman.
          Larry looks at the card in his hand.
                         
                          CAROL
           Thanks very much. Oh, man, I don't know how we're gonna...
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus, I gotta have a drink. I gotta calm myself. I need
           fourteen Zanacks or something.
                         
                          CAROL
           Where is Ted ? I just don't understand where Ted is. I
           mean, you know, all this stuff is happening.
                         
          They start walking away on the sidewalk, while the police officers
          are climbing in their car.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ted ? Ted-Ted's, you know, he's got his date with Marcia
           Fox tonight. He's probably out buying some Spanish Fly.
                         
                          CAROL
           Do you think Helen Moss might be in on this ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Helen ? I don't know and...
                         
                          CAROL
           I think so.
                          LARRY
           I don't want to know about this. I think we should change
           our lives.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, think about it.
                         
                          LARRY
           We should move out of that stupid apartment, you know. You
           know, start over maybe in Mexico.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, no.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, sell blankets. We'll work off the hood of a car
           or something.
                         
          A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of a classical New-York cafeteria. Rows of table on
          either side of the room, each table surrounded by beige imitation-
          leather twin seats. Another row of table in the middle of the
          room, with chairs around them. Huge electrical fans hanging from
          the ceiling.
                         
          The camera pans on the left to a medium shot of the table around
          which Larry and Carol are seated. They are drinking beer.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm just beginning to calm down.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm telling you, I didn't know what's happening. It was
           like one of those television shows, where you open the
           door, and you see a-a dead body. You know, I always hated
           those shows.
                          CAROL
           Yeah. You know, I've never seen a dead person before in my
           whole life.
                         
                          LARRY
           I... The only one I ever saw was my uncle Morris, who was
           ninety-four years old.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           He collapsed from too many lumps in his cereals.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, is this the most exciting thing that's ever happened
           to us in our whole marriage ?
                         
                          LARRY
           This is too exciting. I don't need this. You know, I like
           something quiet... like a fishing trip, a Father's day, you
           know, or, the time we saw Bing Crosby walking on 5th
           avenue. You know, I don't need a murder to enliven my life
           at all.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, whoever did it was probably still in the room
           while we were there. Probably hiding in the closet.
                         
                          LARRY
           Make sure and tell me that just before I go to sleep,
           tonight. That'll be good for me.
                         
                          CAROL
           But you know, that probably means he saw us.
                         
                          LARRY
           Great, I'll never get my eyes closed. You know, I mean,
           what do you want me to do ? I'm petrified. Not only that,
           but I'm a little drunk.
                         
                          CAROL
           I wonder who was cremated. Who was it ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, it was... Well... You know, obviously, it wasn't Mr.
           House, because he has an alibi.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, yeah, but I don't buy that.
                         
                          LARRY
           She doesn't buy that. She doesn't buy the alibi. Let's get
           out of here. I want to go home.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us. It is very dark
          and the sidewalks are wet from a recent rain.
                          LARRY
           Jesus, it's starting to rain again. Can you believe that ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. If only Ted were with us, he'd have a million
           theories about this, I'll tell you that.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I know. I know. Ted's got a mind like a steel sieve.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, right.
                         
          The camera hasn't moved, so now we get a medium shot of Larry and
          Carol. They have reached their car, and Carol walks around it to
          get into the passenger's seat.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know what I think ? I think it's possible. That hotel
           room was on the, on the ext... That end of the hall.
          The camera tilts up the facade of the Waldron Hotel.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           What ? Yeah ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           It's right up there. That's the room.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           I know.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Well, what if they got the body out over that little roof ?
           You know, that would be a possibility. Why would...
                         
          The two windows, which Larry is pointing at, suddenly get lit.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Ohhh !... What are the lights...
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, Jesus.
                         
          The camera tilts back down to street level. Larry and Carol are
          around their car, ready to climb in.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, the lights !
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, that's eerie, isn't it ?
                         
                          CAROL
           My God. This gave me the chills, honey.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, well, let's call the police.
                          CAROL
           I mean... Oh, no, no, no. Come on. Let's go over there now.
           Let's check it out. Come on. We don't have time.
                         
                          LARRY
           Check it out ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes.
                         
                          LARRY
           What, are you nuts ? No, I'm not gonna check that out.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, but look at it, Larry. Look at that. There's lights
           going on, there.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I know, I know. That's crazy. Look, look. Why don't
           we go home and nap, and we'll call the police, and they can
           check it out while we're home in the... ?
          Carol walks away from the car toward the hotel.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, no, the police are red tape. Come on. This is my case,
           honey.
                         
          Larry catches up with her. The camera remains on the sidewalk,
          looking at the couple walking toward the hotel.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean, it's your case ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, it's my case.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, come here. I don't want to do this.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, come on.
                         
                          LARRY
           No.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. If only Ted were with us.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hey, don't give me Ted. Ted would be shaking in his boots.
                         
                          CAROL
           Ted... Oh, God.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm at least just trembling like a leaf.
                         
          They have reached the hotel and they are climbing the steps to the
          entrance of the hotel.
          HOTEL WALDRON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium close shot on a window set in the wall of the lobby. Behind
          the window, the night clerk is sorting some paper. There is a
          grill in the window, to allow people to to talk to the clerk.
                         
          Carol and Larry walk to the window.
                         
                          CAROL
           Um, excuse me. We're with the Police department. We'd like
           to, uh, check out room, uh, six-eleven, please ?
                         
          Larry tries to play the part of the relaxed policeman doing his
          job, but he overdoes it and he looks more bizarre than serious.
                         
           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK
           You were here before.
                         
                          CAROL
           Uh, that's right. Yes. Mm-hm. Yeah.
           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK
           You are Police ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Ee... Ooh, um, just, uh-uh... Show him your card.
                         
                          LARRY
           My what ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Your-Your card. Your-Your Police identification card.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I-I...
                         
                          CAROL
           Your card, you know. Your card. He's got his card.
                         
          Larry goes through the pockets of his jacket and gets the business
          card the police officer gave him. He shows it to the clerk and
          then slides it through a small rectangular hole at the bottom of
          the window. The clerk takes it and looks at it.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. See ?
                         
           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK
           Okay.
                         
          The clerk gives the card back to Carol.
                         
                          CAROL
           Thank you very much. Six-eleven ? Okay. Great.
                         
          The clerks goes and gets the key of the room. He gives it to
          Carol, who drops the card on the small counter under the window.
                         
           HOTEL NIGHT CLERK
           Is there any trouble ?
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, no, no, no. I-m-I'm-I'm-I'm j... I'm-I'm ju...
           um... I'm a detective. They-They-They lowered the height
           requirements, so I... I'll take this card back. They-re,
           they're...
                         
          He takes the card from the counter and puts it back in the inside
          pocket of his jacket.
                         
                          CAROL
           Come on.
                         
                          LARRY
           ...expensive.
                         
          Carol walks toward the elevator and Larry follows her.
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - SIXTH FLOOR HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          As before, the camera is located at one end of the long corridor,
          showing Larry and Carol at the other end of the corridor ready to
          enter Room 611. Larry keeps looking around while Carol is opening
          the door.
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - ROOM 611 - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of the room with the door in the background. The door is
          opening slowly. Carol enters the room, followed by Larry
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           Be careful.
                         
                          CAROL
           Telling me to be careful. Now, just don't upset anything.
           Okay, Larry ?
                         
          Larry closes the door.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm not upsetting anything. I just, you know, I'm just
           gonna leave a-a set of fingerprints around, so if there's a
           trial, we can get trapped.
                         
          The camera follows Carol and Larry moving around the room.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right, now look. The murderer must have, like, hid in
           this closet, right ?
                         
          Carol opens a closet.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't like this.
                         
          Carol gives a quick peek inside the closet, and then closes it.
                          CAROL
           Right, and then he must have...
                         
                          LARRY
           Let's go. You know, I've got to get up early tomorrow. I've
           got to be in temple.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, he must have dragged the b... The body out, really
           fast. What ?
                         
          We hear a click coming from the door of the room.
                         
                          LARRY
           Shhh !...
                         
          Larry picks up a metal lamp from the floor and hides behind a
          closet in front of the door with Carol behind him. The door opens
          and the cleaning lady walks in with her bucket and things. Larry
          is ready to hit her, but, when he realizes who she is, he drops
          the lamp. The cleaning lady yells.
                          CLEANING LADY
           Ahhh !... Oh, Jesus! What...
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm... Didn't mea... I-I, oh, it's-
           It's-It's a...
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, hi.
                         
          Larry opens the door and pushes the lady out of the room.
                         
                          LARRY
           You don't have to turn the bed out. It's not necessary. And
           no-no-no croissants tomorrow for breakfast.
                         
          He takes some money out of his pocket and gives it to her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Here, here. Here, take this for yourself. I like the
           towels. Keep the little mints coming on the pillow, uh...
                         
          He closes the door.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, Jesus. Larry. I mean, really.
                         
                          LARRY
           Let's go. That's why the light was on. This is crazy, we're
           gonna get in trouble.
                         
                          CAROL
           Just a second, Larry. Let me just look around here, just a
           little bit.
                         
          Larry picks up the lamp which is broken in two pieces.
                          LARRY
           Oh, look. I did damage. I... Now. I'll be sued.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh ! Larry !
                         
                          LARRY
           That's what ?
                         
          Carol comes back to Larry, holding something small in her hand.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, look. Look. I thinks that's her wedding band, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           How do you know ?
                         
                          CAROL
           How do I know ? I saw it on her.
                         
                          LARRY
           You did ?
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus.
                         
                          CAROL
           I think so.
                         
                          LARRY
           So much for the police combing every inch of this place.
           Where did you find it ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I found it behind the door, right there.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, brother. Let's get out of here, come on. And take the
           ring with you. Maybe there's a pawnshop open.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay. Okay.
                         
          Larry opens the door and they walk out of the room.

          Medium shot inside the cabin. The elevator is moving down.
                         
                          CAROL
           Didn't I tell you the police weren't thorough ? I mean they
           probably thought we were cranks, right ? I mean, we got no
           body, and... I mean, they must get fifty crisis calls a
           minute. Why would they bother with us ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't know. I just know, this is very deep stuff.
                          CAROL
           Just...
                         
                          LARRY
           We should not be here. I'm scared, this is creepy. You know
           what I mean ? This goes... this could be... Who knows who's
           involved in this ? This could go very deep, Carol. This
           could be like, you know, like with the Warren commission,
           or something. I don't like it.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, not the Warren Commission.
                         
          There is a loud noise and the elevator suddenly stops.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God !
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus ! What is that ?
                          CAROL
           Wait a minute. Okay, all right, now look. All right. The-
           the elevator's probably stuck.
                         
                          LARRY
           Why are we stopping ? Why are we stopping ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Relax now, Larry.
                         
          Carol starts punching all the buttons on the control panel.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't tell me to relax ! I'm-I'm-I'm a-a world-renowned
           claustrophobic.
                         
                          CAROL
           It's okay. It's okay, everything's going to be fine.
                         
                          LARRY
           Stop. Hit something.
                         
                          CAROL
           I am hitting it.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't like this, I don't, I don't...
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, I know. It's okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           It's easy for you to say, but I can't breathe, I'm phobic.
                         
                          CAROL
           The-the idea is, there's plenty of air, in this elevator.
           Uh, Larry, relax. Now, if you just don't panic, okay ?
           Don't panic, all right ?
                          LARRY
           I'm not panicking, I'm not panicking, I'm...
                         
                          CAROL
           Now, just don't worry.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm just going to say the rosary, now.
                         
                          CAROL
           Somebody'll help us. Somebody's gonna help us. Somebody'll
           find us here. Hello !
                         
          She hits the door with the palms of her hands.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, I don't know, I don't like this.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hello !
                          LARRY
           Say something. Stop it.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hallo ! Hallo !
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't like this.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God, look just...
                         
          Larry is getting really hysterical, moving his hands nervously
          around him.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm running over a field, I see open meadows. I see a
           stallion.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, it's...
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm a stallion.
                         
                          CAROL
           Shh. Shut up, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           There's-There's a cool breeze passing over me.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry, just shut up and calm down. Just, okay ? You're
           gonna be o...
                         
                          LARRY
           I see grass. I see dirt.
                          CAROL
           Larry, shut up ! Hallo ! Hallo !
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, you said, you said, «Act as a policeman».
                         
                          CAROL
           I know, yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           I said «No». You said «Pretend to be a policeman». You said
           «Show him your card». I said «What card».
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, wait a minute. I know what. Here, just... Larry,
           boost me up.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, I ca...
                         
          Carol points to the ceiling of the cabin.
                          CAROL
           Boost me up, and we'll get out there. We're gonna do it.
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't get through those things.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Yes we can. I can do it. I can loosen it.
                         
                          LARRY
           It'll never open, they're painted shut.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, wait. No, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           They're-They're... They-They never, they... they never
           open.
                         
                          CAROL
           Come on. All right, put your hand together. Come on. Put
           your hand together.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm breathing.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, no, it's okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry !
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't breathe. I can't breathe.
                          CAROL
           Larry, I mean, it's just... All I have to do is loosen
           that, okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm fainting because the-there's...
                         
          Carol takes Larry's hands and joins them together.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right, put your hand together. Put you hand together.
           Now give me a boost, okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus !
                         
                          CAROL
           All right, you ready ?
                         
          She puts a foot on Larry's hands.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait a second ! Wait, wait !
                         
          Close shot on Larry's distorted face. We see Carol's body going
          up.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus, you've got to cut down on those rich desserts.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, wait a minute, now ! Oh, just wait ! Wait, wait !
                         
                          LARRY
           Let's go, my life is passing in front of my eyes. The worst
           part of it is, I'm driving a used car.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, now you'd think they'd loosen this stupid thing.
                         
          Medium close shot on the ceiling of the cabin. Carol is trying to
          open a trap above the ceiling lamp.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm scared.
                         
          The trap opens, and Lilian House's body comes out. Carol yells and
          falls down on the floor. The upper part of the body is hanging out
          of the trap, with its arms moving around.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God !
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, my God. It's her.
                         
          The camera tilts down to floor level and Larry and Carol.
                         
                          CAROL
           So that's where he hid her.
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus. Claustrophobia and a dead body. This is a
           neurotic's jackpot.
                         
          Suddenly, the lights switch off. The cabin is now pitch dark.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh ! Oh, Larry, hold on. I'm scared.
                         
          We hear the noise of the elevator starting again.
                         
                          LARRY
           We're going down.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God. What's happening ?
                         
                          LARRY
           We're going down.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God, press up ! Press up !
                         
                          LARRY
           Press up ? I can't see my hand. How can I press up ? Jesus.
                         
                          CAROL
           We must be heading for the basement, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           The basement. I want to get off in the mezzanine. I'm
           returning shoes. It's dark in here.
                         
          We hear the noise of the elevator door opening.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ? What are you doing ?
                         
          Apparently Carol has come out of the elevator.
                         
          HOTEL WALDRON - BASEMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          This shot is supposed to be in the basement of the hotel, but
          since it is still pitch dark, we can't tell the difference.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where are you... I'm getting back on the elevator. I don't
           care.
                         
                          CAROL
           I don't know where... Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           I-I can't see anything.
                         
                          CAROL
           There's nothing out there. Wait a minute. What are you
           doing ?
          Larry lights a match, and we see his scared face lit by the flame
          of the match.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, what are you doing with matches ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Th-Th-These are my matches. I got them at...
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait a minute, what... When were you at the «Café des
           Artistes» ?
                         
          Larry blows the match, because it is burning his fingers.
                         
                          LARRY
           Look. I got... Yeah, I was with an author. An authoress.
           At-at the... At...
                         
                          CAROL
           At the «Café des Artistes» ?
                          LARRY
           Yeah, b... A French, a French authoress. An author.
                         
          He lights another match. We very dimly see the basement walls
          around them.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait. Shh ! Shh ! Shh !
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus.
                         
                          CAROL
           Try this way.
                         
          Medium full shot of Carol and Larry walking toward us in a
          corridor. Beside the light of the match, there is some other dim
          light coming from somewhere in the basement.
                         
                          LARRY
           I like a basement with-with knotty pine and a pool table.
           You know, where you can...
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey, look, look, look, look. Uh-huh.
                         
          They are now in close shot.
                         
                          LARRY
           What ? What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           What's this ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I... No, wait a minute. Not so fast. I don't like it here,
           it's dank.
          The camera turns around to follow them in the corridor.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right.
                         
                          LARRY
           And there's strange noises. I don't know what this is. I
           don't know. This...
                         
          We hear a loud metallic bang.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus !
                         
                          CAROL
           Calm down.
                         
                          LARRY
           Calm down ? Don't tell me to calm down.
                         
                          CAROL
           There. Turn the light on.
          Larry switches the light on. They are in a room with beige walls.
          There are pots of paint stacked behind Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           This... Wh-Wh... I-I don't... What do you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me see.
                         
          Carol tries to open a door near Larry, but it is locked.
                         
                          CAROL
           Where... There. Oh. We're locked in here. What are you
           gonna do ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, relax, relax, relax. Don't... I'll break it down. Stand
           back.
                         
          Larry walks back a few steps and rushes on the door, trying to
          break it open.
                         
                          CAROL
           Careful, now.
                         
                          LARRY
           Don't worry. Just-Just give me a second.
                         
          He does it another time.
                         
                          CAROL
           Don't hurt yourself.
                         
                          LARRY
           Must be one of those new doors.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let's try out here.
                         
          Carol points to another room opening in the one they are in.
                         
          Carol and Larry are now walking in a lit corridor.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, my god. I keep hearing noises.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh. What's down there ?
                         
          Carol walks rapidly toward a dark section of the corridor. The
          camera follows her.
                         
                          LARRY
           Where ? Where you... Where are you going ? Don't leave me.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me see. It's okay. What ? Oh !
                         
          She has reached a door with a barred window showing the street
          outside.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. I think this is it. I think this is the service
           entrance.
                         
          She tries to open the door, but it is a bit stuck.
                         
                          LARRY
           Well, come on.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm trying.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on, get it open.
                         
          Carol succeeds in opening the door.
                         
                          CAROL
           I got it. I got it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Go into a trot.
                         
          They rush outside.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE THE WALDRON HOTEL - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Long shot on the dark street. At a distance, we see a man putting
          a large oblong-shaped parcel in the trunk of a car. The man looks
          very much like Paul.
                         
          The camera pans around to give us a reverse-angle medium shot of
          Carol and Larry coming out of the basement of the hotel. They
          stopped in the middle of the short staircase.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait ! Wait ! Did you see that ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What ?
                         
                          CAROL
           It looks like somebody's putting a body into a car.
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus.
                         
                          CAROL
           I swear. Look. It's got a white sheet on it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes.
                         
                          CAROL
           Right... Yeah. Come on.
                         
          Carol walks on to the sidewalk, followed by a very frightened
          Larry.
                          LARRY
           It is. Oh, brother.
                         
          The camera pans back around to give us a reverse-angle shot of the
          car leaving the curb of the street.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Let's-Let's-Let's get out of here. Let's get out of here.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, my God. Wait. No, look ! Let's-Let's follow him. Come
           on.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           No, no, no, no.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Yeah, no. Come on.
                         
          The camera pans back around again to give a reverse-angle medium
          long shot of Carol and Larry running toward their car.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm not going to follow. I'm not gonna... I don't wanna
           follow him.
                         
                          CAROL
           No, let's follow it. I swear, there was a body in that car.
                         
                          LARRY
           I know, I saw that there was a...
                         
                          CAROL
           Larry !
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't wanna follow a car with a body in it.
                          CAROL
           Come on, hurry up. Hurry up !
                         
                          LARRY
           It's-It's probably-It's probably a rented car.
                         
          They have reached their car and they start climbing into it, Larry
          still on the driver's side.
                         
                          CAROL
           There ! Oh !
                         
                          LARRY
           And a rented body.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hurry up. Come on.
                         
          They slam the doors, switch the headlights on and start.
                         
          NEW-YORK - AERIAL OVERVIEW OF BROOKLYN BRIDGE - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          The camera starts with the interchange at one end of the bridge,
          then pans to the bridge itself. At this early hour of the night,
          the bridge still has a lot of traffic moving on it. Then the
          camera moves down to get a closer look of the traffic on the
          bridge.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Oh, Jesus. I-I can't c... I can't follow his car.
                         
          The camera follows the moving traffic on the bridge, and certainly
          also follows Larry's car, even though, from this height, we can't
          tell which car it is.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Well, he's right up ahead. He's right there.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Where, up ahead ? I don't know which car I'm following
           here. I... You know, I'm not a good driver. I can't chase
           somebody in a car. I'm gonna have an accident. I'm, you
           know, I'll-I'll-I'll wind up hitting a school bus or
           something.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Look, it's nighttime. There's no school buses at night-
           time.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Don't tell me that. What about night school ?
                         
          LARRY'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Long shot of the road taken from inside Larry's car. They pass the
          «15W» exit.
                         
          NEW-YORK - INDUSTRIAL PARK - EXTERIOR NIGHT
          Long shot inside an industrial park, somewhere on the outskirts of
          New-York. Larry's car drives slowly inside the park, coming toward
          us. There is no one else at this time of the night. The place is
          lit by a few lampposts, and there is smoke behind Larry's car.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           You have no sense of direction. I was...
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Well, not exactly. Twenty-twenty vision.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           You have no sense of direction.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Not exactly. But anyway... No, I do have a sense of
           direction. He came right here.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Where the hell are we ? What is this ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           I-I don't know why here.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           I don't know, but...
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           There it is !
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           What ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           There's his car. Right there.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           How do you know it's his car ?
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           That's his car.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Oh, it is his car.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           It is his.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Yes. Yes. Yes.
                         
           CAROL (voice over from inside the car)
           Well, of course.
                         
          The car stops.
                         
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Okay, let me turn the light off.
                         
          The car headlights switch off.
           LARRY (voice over from inside the car)
           Be careful, be careful, be careful.
                         
          They both get out of the car, and they start walking toward the
          place where Carol saw the other car.
                         
          They reach the other car surrounded by huge piles of metal scrap.
          The car and the scenery around it are lit by a powerful red light.
          Carol and Larry run toward the place where the red light comes
          from. It is inside a huge building. But they don't go inside the
          building and, instead, keep on running along the building.
                         
          Medium shot on Larry and Carol. Carol stops Larry and points at
          something.
                         
                          CAROL
           Look, look !
                         
          The camera pans to the thing Carol was pointing at. A body, half-
          wrapped in a white sheet, is being lifted by a huge electromagnet.
           LARRY (voice over)
           Oh, my God ! It's Mrs. House's body !
                         
          Reverse high-angle shot on Larry and Carol, as if they were seen
          from the magnet.
                         
                          LARRY
           Come on ! We gotta stop it before it gets dropped.
                         
          Larry takes Carol's hand and runs toward the magnet.
                         
          Reverse angle long shot on a group of workers in the background.
          Then the camera pans to a reverse angle medium shot on Larry and
          Carol coming out between rows of huge heavy-duty bags.
                         
          Reverse angle medium shot on a huge cauldron full of hot melted
          metal. A huge pair of metal jaws is dropping metal scraps into the
          cauldron. Among the metal scraps, we see Mrs. House's body
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God.
                         
          The camera zooms to a close shot on the cauldron.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Good bye, Mrs. House.
                         
          Reverse angle shot on Larry and Carol. Then reverse angle long
          shot on the cauldron. A lot of bright sparks are coming out of the
          cauldron.
                         
          Long shot on the building. Larry and Carol are coming out of the
          building. They start running toward the camera. The camera pans
          around to a medium shot on Paul's car. Through the windshield, we
          see Paul behind the wheel, lit by the red light coming from the
          melted metal. He starts the car and drives away.
                         
          The camera pans around toward Carol and Larry, still running - too
          late - toward Paul's car.
                         
                          LARRY
           That was Mr. House ! That was definitely Mr. House.
                         
                          CAROL
           What are we gonna do ?
                         
          They run after the departing car.
                         
          NEW-YORK - LARRY'S RESIDENCE STREET - EXTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Full shot of Larry's car. He has just parked it, and Carol and he
          are coming out of it.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm gonna call the Police, now.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, Larry, and tell them what ?
                         
                          LARRY
           And get them...
                         
                          CAROL
           I mean, this guy...
                         
                          LARRY
           What are we...
                         
          Larry has walked around the car and joins Carol on the sidewalk.
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, he's got proof his wife died of a heart attack
           two weeks ago. We've got no body. We've got nothing, Larry.
                         
          Larry looks away from her and puts his hand on his mouth, as if
          frightened by something
                         
                          LARRY
           Ohhh !...
                         
                          CAROL
           What ? What ? What's wrong ? What? Oh !...
                         
          The camera turns around Larry and Carol and, located now behind
          Larry's back, gives us a full shot of the entrance of Larry's
          building.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
                         
          Paul and Gladys Dalton, Paul's assistant at his movie house, are
          coming out of the building. Paul tuns his head around and sees
          Carol and Larry.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hallo, there.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hey.
                         
                          PAUL
           How are you ?
                         
                          CAROL
           H-How are you ?
                         
                          PAUL
           May I introduce Gladys Dalton, my gal Friday ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Mrs. D... How are you ? Nice to see you.
                         
          Carol and Larry shake hands with Gladys.
                         
                          PAUL
           This is Larry and Carol, my neighbors.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes.
                          GLADYS
           Nice to see you.
                         
                          PAUL
           We were just watching Madame Bovary. Wonderful.
                         
                          GLADYS
           Such a sad story.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, it is. We, you know...
                         
                          LARRY
           She-She-She gets cremated. She gets killed at the end.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          PAUL
           Yeah. Listen you gotta stop up for a drink before I go on
           my trip.
                         
                          CAROL
           Love to.
                         
                          PAUL
           See you later.
                         
                          CAROL
           See you later.
                         
                          PAUL
           Oh, incidentally, if you hear of anybody who needs an
           apartment, I think I may be moving.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, well, it...
                          PAUL
           See you later. Come on, Gladys.
                         
          He puts his hand on Gladys' shoulder and start walking away with
          her.
                         
                          CAROL
           What a shame.
                         
                          PAUL
           Good night.
                         
                          CAROL
           Good night.
                         
          The camera follows the departing couple, Gladys still walking with
          the help of a cane.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot of Larry and Carol, sitting in their bed. They've
          already put on their nightclothes and they have a last talk before
          going to sleep.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, Jesus. What a day, huh ? I can't figure it out. It's
           got to be that either he's a...
                         
                          CAROL
           What ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Either she's a twin, or he's a twin.
                         
                          CAROL
           He... He...
                         
                          LARRY
           Or they're multiple personalities, or you're a twin or I'm
           a twin.
                         
          Carol laughs.
                         
                          LARRY
           Because I don't know what's going on.
                         
                          CAROL
           You're nuts.
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, look.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait, wait, yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Let me be logical about this.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, she's not a twin. We know she's not a twin.
                          LARRY
           Hey.
                         
                          CAROL
           What are you talking about, Larry ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Stay calm. I want to try and puzzle this out.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm calm, Larry. Okay, but okay, she's a twin, she's not a
           twin. I mean, now you're saying we are twins ? What are
           you, nuts? Okay, I'm calm. I'm calm, okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, I'm going to be logical.
                         
                          CAROL
           All right, all right.
                         
                          LARRY
           The, um, the first thing is this.
                         
                         FLASHBACK SCENE
          LARRY'S LANDING - HALLWAY - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          The door of the elevator opens. Inside the cabin, Larry and Carol
          are smiling and talking.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           We came home that night. There had been a heart attack.
                         
          Some neighbors are gathered around Paul's apartment door. Larry
          asks them questions.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Uh, what if they induced it ? You know, some kind of
           poison. We never saw the body.
                         
          The camera pans inside Paul's corridor, where Mrs. House's body,
          completely covered by a white sheet, is lying dead on a stretcher
          with the doctor and the emergency medical team around her.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           You know, it had to be some other woman. You know, some-
           some woman who probably had some kind of ballpark
           resemblance to Mrs. House.
                         
          The camera pans around to the group of neighbors standing in the
          hallway.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           The super says he saw her, but, uh, he's a drunk, you know.
           Mrs. House could have been hiding.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Back to Larry and Carol sitting in their bed.
                          LARRY
           But you-you remember that you heard a noise that night.
           That had to be Mrs. House leaving to check into the hotel.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah. Yeah. Well...
                         
                          LARRY
           I can't sleep. I just, I...
                         
                          CAROL
           No, wait a minute, wait.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm too, you know... I'm too...
                         
                          CAROL
           But it doesn't make any sense at all, Larry, because
           suddenly, you know, he murders her. I mean, what's it all
           about ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Let me, let me call Vincent's restaurant in New Jersey...
           and why don't we go meet Ted and Marcia and get something
           to eat, and talk with them.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait a minute. At one in the morning ? What are you talking
           about ? You mean... You wanna...
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, so what ? So what ? It's so, you know, Ted-Ted was
           taking her to a show and to-to-to dinner... so they'll be
           there.
                         
                          CAROL
           All the way out to New Jersey...
                         
                          LARRY
           So, hey, kid, this is the apple. This is the town that
           never sleeps. That's why we don't live in Duluth. That,
           plus I don't know where Duluth is.
                         
          He picks up the phone on his night table.
                         
                          LARRY
           Lucky me.
                         
          VINCENT'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Vincent's is a nice cosy place, with dim lights, tasteful
          decorations, and light piano music.
                         
          Full shot of a table with the four customer seen in profile. Larry
          is seated next to Marcia, and across from his wife. Ted is seated
          next to Carol. During the following conversation, the camera moves
          around the table.
                         
                          TED
           Uh, you really saw his face ?
                          CAROL
           Yes. Oh, yes, I'm here to tell you...
                         
                          TED
           You saw, you saw what he looked like ? No question. You
           know exactly who it is.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, no question about it. It was-It was Mr. House. There
           was no... Not a, not a question. I mean, you could see him
           because, uh, you know, there was-there was just no way that
           you could avoid it. He was right there.
                         
          The camera stops on Marcia and thus stops moving around the table.
                         
                          MARCIA
           To me, it's obvious.
                         
                          LARRY
           Wh... How do you see it ?
                          TED
           How obvious ? What do you mean ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Obvious he's committed the perfect murder.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean ?
                         
                          TED
           What ? How ? What do you mean ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Okay, look. You have to start off with another woman who
           bears some ballpark resemblance to Mrs. House.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           That's what I said. That's exac... I used the term
           «ballpark resemblance» myself.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. You used the term, right.
                         
                          LARRY
           It was my idea. I said what she said.
                         
                          MARCIA
           They're with this woman.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                         FLASHBACK SCENE
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
          Paul and another woman, that looks like his wife, are seated
          around a table, having dinner. Lilian House gives a glass of wine
          to the woman, then another one to Paul, and kisses him on the
          forehead.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Maybe having dinner. They don't induce a heart attack,
           because that's fiction bullshit.
                         
          Later. The woman has a hard attack. Paul helps her to walk to the
          sofa.
           MARCIA (voice over)
           She has a heart attack. She drops dead spontaneously.
           They had no thought of killing her. Maybe they wished she
           was dead.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Why ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           I don't know. Maybe they stood to gain if she died. They
           see a golden opportunity.
          Later. Lilian, wearing a pink night-robe, is dressing the dead
          woman, lying on the sofa, into her own clothes.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Mrs. House dresses her up in her clothes. She hides.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           This is my theory. Exactly my theory.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           That's right. She checks into a hotel.
                         
          VINCENT'S RESTAURANT - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Back to the restaurant. Long shot on the table. All the other
          tables are empty. The camera zooms to a full shot of the table,
          Marcia and Larry facing us, and Carol and Ted with their back to
          us.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, well, we got that far, with the exception of the
           actual spontaneous heart attack.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Okay, you know the husband's planning to go to Paris with
           this pretty young woman.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah.
                         
                          MARCIA
           He's cheating on his wife.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah.
                         
                          MARCIA
           So, instead of finishing the scheme they planned, he
           double-crosses her and kills her, taking her share of the
           profits.
                         
                          TED
           Well, you think, you think Helen Moss is in on this, too,
           huh ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Yeah, a good chance she's aware.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, but what about Mrs. Dalton ? He claims he took her to
           the movies.
                         
                          MARCIA
           She's his alibi. She covered for him when he strangled his
           wife. She said he was at work all day.
                          LARRY
           That's right, because he introduced her as a colleague.
                         
          Marcia lights a cigarette.
                         
                          TED
           Wait, why... Why would she...
                         
                          MARCIA
           She's a colleague who maybe loves him.
                         
                          TED
           Oh, wait, wait. He's cheating on her, too.
                         
                          LARRY
           Cheating on two women ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's perfect. Just, it all fits.
                         
                          LARRY
           The guy doesn't look the part.
                         
                          MARCIA
           The point is, he's gotten away with the perfect murder.
           There are no bodies around to prove anything. And all the
           paperwork is strictly above board. He's home free.
                         
                          TED
           Oh, my... Oh, where did you find this woman ? She's a
           genius.
                         
                          LARRY
           She's brilliant. She's brilliant. But the guy... He knows
           that we know, so if he knows we're on him.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, he doesn't care. Why should he ? Everything's been
           neatly disposed of. He's home free. Only he, and maybe his
           mistress, know the truth.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, j...
                         
                          LARRY
           She's right, there's no body.
                         
                          CAROL
           Hold on, hold on, for a second. We don't know this is all
           true. This is just a theory.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, but it's a great theory. Have you been paying
           attention ? This is a great theory.
                         
                          TED
           Oh, yeah. It sounds good, it holds water. Everything fits
           together in this.
                         
                          CAROL
           I am paying attention.
                         
                          LARRY
           I think it's great.
                         
                          MARCIA
           When I come back from the ladies room, I'll tell you how to
           trap him.
                         
          She stands up and starts walking away to the toilets. Larry and
          Ted stand up too. They wait for her to be gone to sit back.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, excuse me.
                         
                          TED
           Where-Where did you find her ? She's-She's-She's really
           something.
                         
                          LARRY
           Her mind, it just goes.
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, she's got one idea after another. It's like one thing
           leads to another.
                         
                          LARRY
           Fantastic.
                         
          Close shot on Carol.
                         
                          CAROL
           I'm surprised you two didn't drool yourself to death.
                         
          The camera zooms back to a medium shot on Carol and Ted.
                         
                          TED
           Oh, I thought we just had a nice first date. That's...
           LARRY (voice over)
           I knew that they would hit it off.
                         
                          CAROL
           Why? Uh-huh. Yeah. Him.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           I-I-I knew this.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, uh-huh. What about you ? You were gonna jump into her
           lap. I saw you, Larry.
                         
          The camera moves around the table to a medium shot on Larry, with
          Ted and Carol's backs in the foreground.
                         
                          LARRY
           What are you talking about ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Huh ?
                          LARRY
           I'm, I'm, huh, what's wrong with you ? I'm her editor. I'm-
           I'm a father figure to her, how...
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, the only thing you didn't do is rub your hands
           together. That was it.
                         
                          LARRY
           You gotta be joking. What... are you telling me that you're
           jealous of Marcia ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I... Well. It's not that I'm jealous.
                         
                          TED
           Kids, kids. People, what are we doing, here?
                         
          The camera pans to a medium close shot on Carol.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, look who's talking. My God, I mean, you kept staring
           into her eyes like she was the Dragon Lady, or something.
                         
          The camera slightly zooms back to show us Larry and Carol
                         
                          LARRY
           What'd wrong with you ? You're jealous because he's-he's
           interested in her.
                         
                          TED
           I'm interested in her theory. What... I don't... What are
           you...
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, I'd just like to know if you take all your-your
           authors to lunch at the Café des...
          Marcia walks back to the table.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Okay, I've got it.
                         
          She sits down, while Larry half-stands up and then sits back.

           Here's the story. Since he's gotten away with it, all we
           can do is bluff. As long as we have no body, we have no
           case.
                         
          The camera pans to Ted.
                         
                          TED
           What... What do you mean ? What do we... We pretend that he
           slipped up, and the molten steel didn't do the job ? What-
           What do you mean ?
                         
          The camera pans back to Marcia.
                          MARCIA
           Yeah, it's possible. He saw you there, he knows you're onto
           him. After he ran away, why couldn't you have retrieved the
           body ?
                         
                          LARRY
           You're kidding. I... We couldn't have gotten her out of
           that. We... I would have wound up with a few toes and a
           shoulder, maybe, at most.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, that's... Okay, okay, you have the body. What does he
           know ? He was probably too scared to be very lucid.
                         
          The camera pans to Ted, who looks at Marcia with worshipping eyes.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           He's an amateur. He dumped the body and ran off, and then
           somehow - who knows the details, you two dug her out. Now,
           you can send him to the chair.
                         
                          CAROL
           Okay, okay, just...
                         
                          TED
           I like this woman, she's lurid.
                         
                          CAROL
           Let me tell you why he's not going to believe us, okay ?
                         
          The camera pans on Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, first of all, because I can't, I can't bluff or lie
           without giggling, so-so...
                         
          The camera pans to Carol.
                          CAROL
           Yeah. No, because if we really had the body, why tell him ?
           Why not go straight to the Police ?
                         
          The camera pans to Marcia.
                         
                          MARCIA
           If you tell the cops, you can't shake him down.
                         
          Medium shot on another table, around which two middle-aged men are
          seated, listening very eagerly to the conversation.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Oh, she's wicked. Oh, I-look... look how, look how this
           works out. You go to the law, what do you gain ?

                          TED
           I mean, so-so maybe they, you know, they put him in jail.
           What have you got ? You haven't got anything.
           LARRY (voice over)
           Right.
                         
                          TED
           But if he wants the evidence, and he's got to pay for it,
           now... Okay, now he's nervous, right ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah, you know, wait. There's just so many fallacies in
           this, I can't even count them.
                         
          The camera pans to Marcia and Larry.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           What ? Name one.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Name one? Okay, the guy looks us straight in the eyes and
           says, «What body? What the hell are you talking about ?
           Prove it».
                         
                          MARCIA
           Well, that's when we keep bluffing.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           What ? How ? What do we do ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           We produce the body.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yeah, but where are you gonna get it. Madame Tussaud's ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Yeah. Say-Say we found someone to corroborate this story.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, really. J-Just...
                         
                          MARCIA
           Someone he trusted.

           Like who ?
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Like his lover. Say she called and said, «Paul, I've just
           seen Lillian's body. They want a hundred thousand dollars
           for it».
                         
                          TED
           Why-Why would she do that ?

           MARCIA (to Larry)
           Remember that book you recommended to me ? «Murder in
           Manhattan» ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, yes. Max Schindler's book. That's right, the phone
           call.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           I don't remember that book.
                         
                          LARRY
           This is perfect.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           You never mentioned that book to me.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no. Because you don't like light reading, so I never...

           Since when did I not like light reading, Larry ?
                         
                          TED
           I don't know... I don't know this book. What is this book ?
                         
          The camera pans to Larry and Marcia.
                         
                          LARRY
           This book. That's fantastic ! It would be so perfect
           because s-she's a, she's a-an, actress, or would-be
           actress, anyhow, and you're-you-re... Jeez, we could use
           his theatre. He's a playwright. This is so perfect. Your
           theatre is empty all the time, anyhow.

                          TED
           Oh, yeah, thank you. That's great. What-What are we talking
           about here ? What-What do you mean ? What-What is this ?

                          LARRY
           Listen to this. What you do is, we get her in for a fake
           audition, and you write some lines that don't mean
           anything.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           And she does them, and she doesn't know what she's doing
           and we tape-record it.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Uh...
                          LARRY
           Listen to this.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           I'm listening.
                         
                          LARRY
           And we edit it up. We edit the tape recording up, and we
           make one end of a phone call...
                         
          The camera pans to Ted and Carol.

           ...and we play it into the phone to Mr. House.
                         
                          TED

           CAROL (voice over)
           Oh, come on. No, that could never, ever work, in a million
           years. You don't know what he's going to say.

           What's he gonna say ?

           In the book, they use several tape recorders.
           CAROL (voice over)
           In the book ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           We coordinate it.
                         
                          LARRY
           It's coordinated.

                          CAROL
           In the book. You mean, you're basing your plan on some dumb
           paperback ?
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           This is great. This is great.

           I s... No, really.

           LARRY (voice over)
           It's great. What happens, is... it provokes him to kill
           again. They catch him the second time.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Exactly. He's gotten away with the first murder.

                          LARRY
           Actually, in the book what happens is, now that I think of
           it, he... he kills the... the two people that are working
           the scheme on him.

           Yeah, that's all right.

           Um, well, I don't know.

           Either that, or I've... I've just developed Parkinson's.

           No, we can handle him. We can handle him. Listen, this is
           incredible. This is an incredible idea.
                          MARCIA
           It's perfect. It's perfect. He knows you're onto him. You
           shake him down.
                         
                          CAROL

           This is great.
                         
                          CAROL
           Wait, no, okay... What you're saying... Oh boy. You're
           saying, you want to provoke Mr. House into trying to murder
           Larry and me.
                          MARCIA
           Yeah. It's perfect. You're not scared, are you ?
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, no, no, no, I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm
           just turning it over in my mind. I just want to check with
           my clergyman before we commit.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot on Helen Moss, making a phone call from an open booth
          in the street. While she is talking, the camera comes closer to
          her, to a medium close shot on her face.
                         
                          HELEN
           Hi, uh, B-twenty-four messages ? Oh, really ? Audition for
           what ? Did he say ? Okay, okay. Wait, hold on.
                         
          She looks into her purse and gets her agenda out of it.
                         
                          HELEN
           Let me get a pencil. Okay.
          TED'S THEATRE - STAGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full slightly high-angled shot on the stage. In the middle of the
          stage floor, a white circle, on which there is a chair and a small
          table with a telephone. Suzanne Raphael, a young woman, is
          auditioning. She is seated on the chair, holding the telephone.
          Behind Suzanne, which is the left side of the stage seen from the
          audience, a white wall, with a doorless opening. On either side of
          the wall, two red columns. And on either side of the girl, which
          are the front and the back of the stage, two red metallic frames.
          In front of the girl, a video camera on a tripod, with an operator
          standing behind the camera. Actually, the operator is Sy, Larry
          and Carol's friend, whom we have seen much earlier in the film, in
          the antique market and at Elaine's restaurant. The stage is well
          lit, when the audience hall is in the dark.
                         
                          SUZANNE
           Yeah, well, Dad, you know, I've heard just about enough of
           this.
                         
          She slams the phone down. The camera pans around to show us the
          right side of the stage, where there is several rows of theatre
          seats and a table in front of the seats. Ted, Marcia and Marilyn
          are seated in the front row. Marilyn is Sy's wife, whom we have
          also seen earlier in the film. Carol is seated in the second row,
          behind Marcia.
                         
                          TED
           Good, that's great. Thank you, Suzanne. Thank you.
                         
                          MARCIA
           We'll let you know. That's Suzanne Raphael, right ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah. Good, thank you.
                         
          Carol taps on Marilyn's shoulder, and whispers something to her.
          Ted joins them in their whispered conversation. The camera pans
          back on the stage. Larry, with a clipboard in his hand, has
          entered the stage, pushing Helen in front of him.
                         
                          LARRY
           This is Helen Moss.
                         
                          HELEN
           Hi, there.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Hi, there.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Hi.
                         
                          HELEN
           Hi.
                         
          Medium close shot on Ted, who stands up, and walks toward the
          stage. The camera follows him.
                          TED
           Uh, have you, uh... I know, I know you just got the
           material, uh, you know, just in the... last little while,
           but... uh, h-have you had a chance to-to study it ? To go
           over it, a little bit ?
                         
          The camera pans to a medium close shot of Helen.
                         
                          HELEN
           Yes, yes. Uh, I have, but, um, I have just a few questions.
                         
                          TED
           Sure , yeah.
                         
          The camera moves slightly, and is now located behind Ted's back,
          still with Helen in medium close shot.
                         
                          HELEN
           Is she divorced, in this ?
                         
                          TED
           Uh, yes. Yes.
                         
                          HELEN
           Uh, recently ?
                         
                          TED
           Yes. Yeah. But she's, uh, very, highly emotional.
                         
                          HELEN
           Yeah.
                         
                          TED
           You know really... uh, lot of... Lot of feeling. Very
           strong.
                         
                          HELEN
           Oh.
                          TED
           Hm ?
                         
                          HELEN
           Should I just begin ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, just... Whenever, you know, whenever you feel it.
           Whenever you feel into it.
                         
          Ted walks away. Helen takes a very deep breathing, sits down, puts
          her hands trough her hair, takes another breathing, and picks up
          the phone handset from the telephone on the table. She overdoes it
          a lot, trying to act as the prima dona she is not.
                         
                          HELEN
           Yeah, okay.
                         
          She dials a fake number on the phone keyboard.
                         
                          HELEN
           Hello, Joe ? I-I was just... I...
                         
           TED (voice over)
           Uh, let me stop you right there.
                         
          Helen looks in Ted's direction.
                         
           TED (voice over)
           I'm sorry, I... uh, if you'll be... if you'll start out
           more frightened... then that'll take you where you're gonna
           go.
                         
                          HELEN
           Right, right.
                         
          She breathes deeply before starting again.
                         
                          HELEN
           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, now, and if I sound
           strange, don't get alarmed.
                         
          Later. Helen is auditioning another scene. She doesn't have the
          phone in her hand any more. She is holding a script and looking at
          it. Larry is seated in front of her, and read his own script on
          his clipboard.
                         
                          HELEN
           Give me your hand. Hold on. Try not to fall. Hold on.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm trying, I'm trying.
                         
                          HELEN
           Quickly ! Hurry !
                         
          Later. Close shot of Helen's face auditioning another scene.
                         
                          HELEN
           They're asking two hundred thousand dollars for it. Yeah.
           They say it's Monet, but I say it's a fake.
                         
          Medium shot of Helen, seen from behind. We see Sy standing behind
          his camera on her right, and Larry standing with his clipboard in
          his hand on her left. In the background, Ted, Marcia, Marilyn and
          Carol listening to her. While Helen is talking, the camera moves
          backward through the opening in the scenery.
                         
                          HELEN
           Ever since Joe came home from Vietnam, he's cast a pall on
           everything. A dark cloud, a pall.
                         
          A BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT.
                         
          Full shot on the upper level of a building, that could be either
          Ted's theatre of Sy's workshop. The camera tilts down to street
          level.
                         
          SY'S WORKSHOP - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          We are inside Sy's workshop. It is full of very high-tech video
          and audio equipment.
                         
          Medium shot of Marilyn standing behind a computer. Close to her,
          Carol is seated on a table, and Ted is standing next to her. They
          are both looking at a large video monitor. On the monitor screen
          and on the computer screen, we see the same picture of Helen
          auditioning with the telephone in her hand.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much, right now...
                         
          The camera pans to Marcia, seated behind Carol and also looking at
          the monitor. Behind her, Sy is looking at another monitor, and
          manipulating some switches on an editing machine underneath the
          monitor. Larry is standing next to him.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
                         
          Sy rewinds the video tape.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Joe ? I can't talk much right now.
                         
          Sy fast winds the tape.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Joe ? Ever since Joe came back from Vietnam...
                         
          Close shot on Ted's face, then the camera pans to Carol and
          Marcia, seated one behind the other, and behind them, Sy working
          on the editing machine, with Larry standing next to him. The
          camera zooms on Sy.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           ... he's cast a pall on everything. A dark cloud, a pall.
                         
          Sy rewinds the tape.
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           A pall.
                         
          Sy rewinds the tape.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Pall.
                         
          Sy rewinds the tape.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Pall.
                         
          Slightly later. Medium close shot of Ted looking at something we
          don't see, with Marcia standing next to him.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Joe ?
                         
          The camera pans to Carol standing up and looking at the same thing
          as Ted. We hear Helen's voice distorted by Sy's editing machine.
           HELEN'S VOICE (distorted)
           Hello, Joe.
                         
          The camera pans back on Ted and Marcia, then it pans to a close
          shot of a big high-tech tape recorder, on which Sy is working. We
          see his hands cutting off a short section of the audio tape, and
          gluing back the two severed ends of the tape together.
                         
          Full shot of the room. In the foreground, Sy is working on his
          tape recorder. On his right, Larry is standing and looking at him.
          On his left, Marilyn also looking at him. Behind him, Carol, Ted
          and Marcia, all looking at him.
                         
                          TED
           It's so...
                         
          The camera zooms on Ted and Marcia.
                         
          Close up shot on the tape recorder. Sy starts it.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Paul ? I can't talk much, right now...
                         
          The camera tilts up from the tape recorder to a medium shot on Ted
          and Marcia. Ted smiles when he hears the work Sy has done with the
          tape.
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           ... and if I sound strange, don't get alarmed.
                         
                          MARCIA (SMILING)
           Perfect.
                         
          She shakes hands with Larry.
                         
                          TED
           That's great.
          He also shake hands with Larry, moving slightly Carol out of the
          way.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You did great. Great.
                         
          Larry suddenly notices that Carol has been excluded from the hand-
          shaking party, and he turns around toward her.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, yeah, it's, excuse me, hey, don't worry, yeah, okay.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Fantastic.
                         
          MARCIA'S CAR - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The camera is behind Marcia, who is driving in a street in New-
          York. We see Helen walking on the sidewalk.
                         
                          MARCIA
           There she is.
          The camera pans around, from inside the car, to get a better shot
          of Helen.
                         
                          TED
           Where ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           You have to keep her busy for all afternoon.
                         
          Through the back window of the car, we see Helen entering a
          restaurant called «Time».
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'll-I'll just keep
           improvising, you know ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Okay, well, it shouldn't be too hard. She's a hungry
           actress, you're a playwright with a role.

          talking together.
                         
                          TED
           You know what ? I'll g... I'll talk about the play, or, get
           her, get her talking about the part, you know, her life.
           I'll get her talking about her life, and her whole
           background. Stop the car, I'm gonna get out here.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Good. We'll hook up later, okay ?
                         
                          TED
           All right. Good - Good luck with your assignment. Ok ?
                          MARCIA
           All right, you too.
                         
          Marcia has stopped the car, and Ted is getting out of it.
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of a large room, furnished with good taste. In the
          background a large bay window, overlooking some green trees. On
          the right, there is a large modern mantlepiece. On the left, a
          bicycle is leaning on the wall. Under the window, a large and cosy
          sofa.
                         
          Carol and Sy are standing in front of the window and talking
          together. Next to them and Marcia is also standing and reading a
          large album. In the foreground, Larry, who is the only one not to
          be casually dressed, and is wearing jacket and necktie, is playing
          with a small cassette-player in his hands. Marilyn is walking into
          the room.
                         
                          MARILYN
           Listen, does anybody want some guacamole or anything ?
          Sy walks toward her, holding another cassette player. Carol is
          also holding one.
                         
                          SY
           Would you stop with the guacamole ? We have to get started
           with this.
                         
          He looks at his watch.
                         
                          LARRY
           He should be back for lunch, right ?
                         
                          SY
           Come on, let's go.
                         
                          MARILYN
           Yeah. All right, let's go.
                         
                          LARRY
           So, everybody's got the right tape recorder and the right
           tape in ?
                         
                          SY
           Yes, we do.
                         
          They all sit down around a low table.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           All right, one second. And then we ca... I mea... so, uh,
           we're on speaker.
                         
                          CAROL
           This is so insane.
                          LARRY
           Now wait, wait, wait. There's, um... I'm not nervous.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, w...
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The backstage is in the same disorder as before, with all the
          mirrors scattered around. Full shot of Paul and Gladys standing in
          the middle of the room
                         
                          PAUL
           I have the contractor come in and nobody's here ? Now you
           see if you can find...
                         
          The phone rings.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'll get that. Uh, you go and call him.
                         
          Paul walks out of the room.
                          GLADYS
           Oh. Yes, yes, all right.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Paul walks into a small room in a corner of the backstage. It must
          have been a dressing room, but now it is full of various junk,
          with a big poster, that looks like a enlarged newspaper, on the
          wall. Paul picks up the phone from a small counter fixed on the
          wall.
                         
                          PAUL
           Hallo ?

          Full shot of the little group around the low table. Marcia and
          Larry are seated next to each other in front of the camera, Sy is
          seated on Larry's left and his wife on Marcia's right. Carol is
          seated on the other side of the table, with her back to the
          camera.
                         
          Marcia, who is seated next to the telephone, presses the «play»
          button on her cassette player. Helen's voice comes out of it.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound
           strange, don't get alarmed.
                         
          Marcia presses the «stop» button.

                          PAUL
           What's the problem ?
          He sits down.
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Marcia presses the «play» button.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          PAUL
           Say that again.
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Carol is shaking her head, not paying much attention to what is
          going on. Marilyn and Marcia both silently point to Carol's
          cassette player, to tell her it is her turn to play it. Carol
          picks up her player to put it in front of the telephone and
          presses the «play» button.
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           They have your wife's body. They showed it to me.

                          PAUL
           Exactly who has it ? How many are there ?
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          It is Sy's turn to switch his player on.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Your neighbors. That's right. They want two hundred
           thousand dollars for it.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          PAUL
           Where are you calling from ? There's an echo. Are you on a
           speaker phone ?
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The group seems surprised by a question they did not expected.
          Marcia silently points to Marilyn's player. Marilyn presses the
          «play» button.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hold on.
                         
          Marcia presses on the «mute» button on the telephone set.
                         
                          LARRY
           We don't have an answer for that. What are we gonna do ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           Go to a different thought.
                         
                          CAROL
           Mm...mmm... What thought ? Wait.
                         
          Marcia presses the «mute» button on the telephone. Sy turns to
          Carol.
                         
                          SY
           Shhh !...
                         
          Carol puts her hand in front of her mouth. Larry gets his player
          close to the telephone and presses the «play» button
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           You've either got to pay them off, or get rid of them.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          PAUL
           Look, we can't talk about this on the phone. Can you meet
           me ?
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          It is still Larry's turn to use his player.
                         
           HELEN'S VOICE (louder)
           Yes! They're keeping it refrigerated.
                         
          Marcia hits Larry's elbow, to tell him it was the wrong cue.
                         
           PAUL (voice over in the speaker of the telephone)
           What ? What did you say ?
                         
          Larry is very nervous all of a sudden, and puts another player in
          front of the telephone.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           About two hours ago.
                         
          Larry drops the player.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          PAUL
           Two... what ? Two hours what ?
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Marcia points to Marilyn's player. Marilyn presses the «play»
          button.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hold on.
                         
          Marcia presses the «mute» button on the telephone set. Larry just
          got the cassette out of his player and can't put it back in. He is
          more and more nervous.
                          LARRY
           Jesus... we're all screwed up. I got this all screwed up.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Okay, let's get off as quick as possible. We've done it.
                         
                          SY
           All right, well, do something. Do something.
                         
           MARCIA (to Larry)
           Shhh !... Um, okay. Sh !...
                         
          She presses the «mute» button on the telephone, then presses the
          «play» button on her player.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hello, Paul. I can't talk much right now. And if I sound
           strange, don't get alarmed.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          PAUL
           Look, Helen, you're not making any sense. I know you're
           upset, but you have to pull yourself together. Now, could
           we meet ? The usual spot.
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           Hold on.
                         
          Marilyn, who has just been playing her player, presses the «stop»
          button on it. Then Marcia presses the «mute» button on the
          telephone. Meanwhile, Larry has succeeded in getting a good length
          of tape out of his cassette, and tries to put it back in !
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          PAUL
           Helen ? Helen, you still there ? Helen ?
                         
          SY AND MARILYN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is still trying to put the tape back into the cassette.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Okay, hurry up, hurry up. Okay.
                         
                          LARRY
           Somebody press something, come on.
                         
          Now, Larry is surrounded by a hundred feet of tape, which is
          flying all around him ! Marcia points to Carol's player.
                         
                          CAROL
           What ?
                         
                          LARRY
           You can't press some... Come on.
          Marcia presses the «mute» button on the telephone, and Carol
          presses the «play» button on her player.
                         
                          HELEN'S VOICE
           You have no choice, they've got the goods. You just pay
           them off, or get rid of them. I have to hang up.
                         
          Marcia presses the «off» button on the telephone.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Paul slowly puts the telephone down on its hook. He stands up and
          walks back to the backstage.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
                          GLADYS
           What's the matter, Paul ? You look all shaken up.
                         
                          PAUL
           No, no. It's nothing.
                          GLADYS
           I worry about you these days, Paul.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm fine, I'm fine.
                         
                          GLADYS
           You're different.
                         
                          PAUL
           I said I was fine. Will you stop interfering ?
                         
                          GLADYS
           You never used to pull away from me.
                         
           PAUL (getting mad)
           I told you to leave me alone ! I don't want to have this
           conversation all the time !
                         
          He walks out and Gladys put her hands on her eyes. She slowly
          walks away with the help of her cane.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET OUTSIDE SY AND MARILYN'S HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Full shot of a nice building with short trees and wrought iron
          gates in front of it. We hear voices but we don't see anyone yet.
                         
           LARRY (voice over)
           Great. All right. Now, my job is to wait exactly one hour
           and call Mr. House from a phone booth. Where are you...
           Where are you running so fast ?
                         
          Carol runs out of the building.
                         
                          CAROL
           I have to go home and change.
                         
          Larry comes out of the building and closes the door. Carol turns
          toward him.
                         
                          CAROL
           I've got an appointment with a friend of Ted's about a
           location for... What ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What's the matter ? What are you so angry about ? What are
           you so... What are you so steamed up about ?
                         
                          CAROL
           What do you mean ? Well, I meant... I just don't understand
           how you could give a book to Marcia, and not to me.
                         
          They start walking down the street. The camera follows them.
                         
                          LARRY
           What are you talking about ?
                         
                          CAROL
           I just don't need...
                          LARRY
           We had just a big success in there.
                         
                          CAROL
           What...
                         
                          LARRY
           Marcia likes to read what I like to read.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, right, God. Yeah, well it's true. I guess it's true. I
           mean, we've got nothing in common, that's for sure. Now
           that, now that Nick's grown up, I mean, you know, we're
           just left facing each other.
                         
                          LARRY
           You got stuff in common with Ted, right ? You can cook
           together with Ted, or you can take your clothes off and
           baste a chicken with him.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, right. Oh, oh, well, what about you and Marcia, huh ?
           What does she teach you besides poker ? That's what I'd
           like to know, okay ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Mud wrestling. Is that what you want to hear ? Nothing, I'm
           her editor.
                         
                          CAROL
           Look, I think the time has come for us to reevaluate our
           lives.
                         
                          LARRY
           I reevaluated our lives.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                          LARRY
           I... I... I got a ten. You got a six.
                         
          The camera stops moving and just shows just the departing couple
          walking down the street.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, listen, I think maybe I will go back to seeing my
           shrink.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh. You don't have to see your shrink. There's nothing
           wrong with you that can't be cured with a little Prozac and
           a polo mallet.
                         
                          CAROL
           Just... I just would like to be alone for a while, okay,
           Larry ?
                         
                          LARRY
           What are you talk...
                          CAROL
           Just... just, I... I... Uh, okay ?
                         
          Long shot of Carol running away, while Larry, standing in the
          middle of the sidewalk, looks at her going away.
                         
          A CAFETERIA - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          A classical New-York cafeteria, with tables and chairs scattered
          all around the room. In the background the long counter, where the
          food is displayed, and along which the customer are lining up at
          lunchtime. Around a slightly isolated table on the left, Ted and
          Helen are talking.
                         
                          HELEN
           So, I have this, like, really crazy father and everything.
                         
                          TED
           Oh, yeah ?
                         
          The camera zooms to a medium shot on Ted and Helen.
                         
                          HELEN
           And, yeah. He's wanted, like, in three states. He has a
           terrible driving record. So we had to move from Virginia
           then to New Jersey, and...
                         
                          TED
           So, your father is wanted in three states for driving ?
           Really ?
                         
                          HELEN
           Yeah, for driving. Yeah. So I moved to Hackensack, and
           then... Well, anyway, I was in all these different contests
           and I was even, uh, Miss, uh, Teenage Passaic.
                         
                          TED
           Oh, how wonderful.
                         
          LARRY'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot of the room. The front door opens and Carol walks in.
          She slams the door shut and puts her purse on a table. She takes
          her coat off, walks into the corridor and opens a closet to put
          the coat away in it. She then chooses a new set of clothes and
          shoes to go to her appointment. She closes the closet and walks
          into the bathroom to change. She closes the bathroom door. The
          camera remains outside the bathroom and starts moving along the
          corridor back to the front door. The front door opens and Paul
          walks in. He walks silently along the corridor toward the
          bathroom.

           Was that before or after the fourth abortion ?
                          HELEN
           Well, after the fourth, but before the drama prize.
                         
                          TED
           The drama prize ?
                         
                          HELEN
           And... Mm... hm.

           Yeah, yeah.

          Larry is in an open phone booth in a quiet street. He picks up the
          handset, put a coin in the slot, and starts dialing the number he
          has written on a piece of paper.
                         
                          LARRY
           Hallo, Mr. House ? This is Larry Lipton. I... I got a... a
           package I think you're gonna want. Of course it's gonna
           cost you, uh, $200,000 in... in small, unmarked bills.
           Or... or... or large marked ones, if... if... if you want
           to go that route.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          The small disused dressing-room in the corner of the backstage.
          Paul is talking into the telephone. In front of him, Carol is tied
          on a chair, with a white cloth gag taped on her mouth. While Paul
          is talking, the camera zooms on Carol's frightened face.
                         
                          PAUL
           And I have a package you might want, Mr. Lipton. If you
           ever wanna see your wife alive again, you'll do as I say.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is still in the phone booth.
                         
                          LARRY
           Oh, really ? Well, I think you're bluffing. Yeah, don't...
           don't ever try and bluff a bluffer. Yeah, if... if you got
           Carol, put her on the phone.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Paul takes the gag off Carol's mouth and put the phone mouthpiece
          in front of her lips.
                         
                          CAROL (CRYING)
           Larry, Larry, help me ! I'm here, Larry !
                         
          Paul puts the gag back on Carol's mouth

                          LARRY
           Oh, my... Oh, my God. D... Don't hurt her !
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Paul is holding the gag in front of Carol's mouth with one hand
          and the telephone with the other hand.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'll tell you exactly where to meet me, and you bring that
           package I want. Now, once I have it and I'm safely gone,
           you'll get your wife back. Otherwise, I'll kill her.
                         
          NEW-YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry is now very very frightened.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes, yes. Yeah, no, no, no, no. I... I... I understand. I,
           uh, yes, no. I'll be there. I'll be there. I... I... Yes,
           I'll b... I... I'll bring your wife's body, she... In...
           in... in the trunk of my car. Yes, I'll... I... I promise.
           I'll be there. I...
                         
          Larry hangs up and hold the side of the phone booth.
                         
                          LARRY
           I don't have his wife's body. Bluff, bluff.

          Long shot of a street covered with iron works. Actually, this is
          the same street and the same shot as the one we saw earlier in the
          film, when Ted and Carol were following Helen going to Paul's
          movie house in a yellow cab.
                         
          Larry's car is coming toward us, and then turns into the dead-end
          street where the back entrance of Paul's movie house is located.
                         
          DEAD END STREET BEHIND PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Larry stops the car near the entrance of the movie house. Paul is
          waiting for him.

                          LARRY
           Where's Carol ?
                         
          Paul walks toward the car. He's got a gun in his hand.
                         
                          PAUL
           First show me Lillian's body.
                         
                          LARRY
           I... I got it.
                         
                          PAUL
           There's no way she could have survived that vat of molten
           steel.

           No, no, I... I... I got...
                         
                          PAUL
           If you're not bluffing, where is she ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Why are you so nervous ? What are you so nervous about ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Where ?
                         
                          LARRY
           If I don't have her, what are you so nervous ?
                         
                          PAUL
           Where is she ?
                          LARRY
           I got her in the trunk of my car.
                         
                          PAUL
           Open it. Come on, now.
                         
                          LARRY
           I... I got her.
                         
                          PAUL
           If she's not there, I'll put a bullet through your head.
           Now, open it !
                         
                          LARRY
           I... I...
                         
          Larry walks around his car toward the trunk.
                         
                          PAUL
           Come on! Come on!
                         
          Larry opens the trunk.
                          PAUL
           Step back!
                         
          Larry takes something in the trunk, then closes it back, but the
          door of the trunk doesn't close well and opens again. Larry walks
          back to Paul and shows him what he's got in his hand.
                         
                          LARRY
           No, no, I got her. See, if I don't have her, how come I got
           her ring ? I got her ring, there. This is... This is her
           ring.
                         
                          PAUL
           I think you're lying !
                         
          He walks to the open trunk.
                         
                          LARRY
           It's a... No, no, no, no. Uh.
                         
          Paul takes a bad-looking dummy out of the trunk. Apparently, it is
          an amateur dummy that Larry has made himself.
                         
                          PAUL
           What is this ? What is this ?
                         
          He throws the dummy back in the trunk.
                         
                          LARRY
           I could never bluff.
                         
                          PAUL
           What ?
                         
                          LARRY
           I... I... I've lost a fortune in cards over the years.
                          PAUL
           Listen to me.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm not a bluffer.
                         
                          PAUL
           I'm going to put a... Get a...
                         
          They start fighting.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Carol is still tied and gagged on the chair. She tries desperately
          to get free.
                         
          DEAD END STREET BEHIND PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot on Larry and Paul, still fighting. Larry succeeds in
          getting away from Paul, who fires his gun. But, apparently, Larry
          is not hit by the gunshot, because he runs toward the back
          entrance of the movie house. The camera follows him.
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot on the staircase on the side of the backstage. Larry
          runs down the stairs, while we hear the sound of the «Lady from
          Shangai». «The Lady from Shangai» is a 1947 film written, directed
          and played by Orson Welles.
                         
                         
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           That's what Grisby thought. But, of course, she meant to
           kill Grisby, too. After he'd served his purpose. Poor
           howling idiot.
                         
          Larry has now reached the backstage. He is behind the screen, a
          small part of which is seen on the side of the shot.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           He never even did that. He went and shot Broome. And that
           was not part of the plan. Broome might have got to the
           police before he died.
                         
          Larry walks around the backstage, trying to find his way. We see
          the black and white film on the screen, but also reflections of
          the screen on the multiple mirrors scattered around the backstage.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           And if the cops traced it to Grisby... and the cops made
           Grisby talk, he'd spill everything.
                         
          Medium shot on the staircase. Paul is walking very slowly
          downstairs.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           And she'd be finished, so she had to shut up Grisby but
           quick.
          Back on Larry, still trying to find his way around the backstage.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           And I was the fall guy.
                         
          Full shot on the screen, where a man is falling down a long slide,
          like the one used by kids on playgrounds. We hear the film music.
                         
          Medium close shot on two mirrors, one behind the other. On the
          mirrors, we see the reflection of the screen. Paul is slowly
          walking from behind the first mirror, his gun in hand.
                         
          Full shot on the mirrors, with Larry walking cautiously among
          them.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium shot on Carol in the small room. She is still trying to get
          free from her bonds and gag.
                         
           ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)
           Why don't you try to understand ?
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - BACKSTAGE - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Back to the mirrors showing numerous reflections of the screen.
                         
           ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)
           He was mad. He had to be shot.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           And what about me ?
                         
          Paul walks in, his gun in his hand.
                         
           ELSA (Rita Hayworth - voice over from the film)
           We could have gone off together.
                         
          Close shot of Larry half-hidden behind a large mirror.
                         
           MICHAEL (Orson Welles - voice over from the film)
           One who follows his nature, keeps his original nature in
           the end.
                         
          Larry inadvertently drops the large mirror on the floor. The
          mirror breaks with a crashing sound.
                         
           CAROL (voice over)
           Help ! Help !
                         
          The camera pans to Paul, walking slowly with his gun pointed
          toward Larry.
                         
                          PAUL
           They can't see us behind the screen, and they can't hear us
           with the sound on. Not even a gunshot.
                         
          Behind Paul, we see the film on the screen. We have now reached
          the famous last scene of the film, shot in the hall of mirrors.
          Rita Hayworth's face is reflected on the many mirrors in the film,
          just like, in the actual scene in the backstage, Paul and Larry
          are reflected on the many mirrors scattered around.
                         
           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)
           I knew I'd find you two together.
                         
          Arthur's figure, walking with a cane, is reflected in the many
          mirrors in the film. Just the same, Gladys, who has just entered
          the backstage, walking with a cane, is also reflected on the
          mirrors scattered around her. She has a gun in the hand which is
          not holding the cane.
                         
          While Gladys and Paul are talking, the film keeps on showing on
          the screen behind them, but we do not understand the words from
          the film, because Paul and Gladys' voices are louder.
                         
                          GLADYS
           Hallo, Paul. Didn't you expect me ?
                         
          Medium shot on the mirrors, showing several reflections of Paul.
                         
                          PAUL
           Mrs. Dalton.
                         
          Close shot on Gladys' face. While she is talking, the camera pans
          away from her, showing her reflection on a mirror.
                         
                          GLADYS
           You made a lot of promises to me, over the years. And then,
           you decided to dump me for that young model.
                         
          The camera keeps on panning, showing another reflection of Gladys.
                         
           PAUL (voice over)
           I never led you on.
                         
           GLADYS (with a very harsh voice)
           It's late for excuses.
                         
          Medium shot on the mirrors showing several reflections of Paul.
                         
                          PAUL
           None of you can prove anything.
                         
          Full shot of the screen, showing Arthur and his numerous
          reflections on the mirrors in the film.
                         
           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)
           So you'd be foolish to fire that gun.
                         
          Low angle shot on the staircase, showing Larry going down the
          stairs.
                         
           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)
           With these mirrors, it's difficult to tell. You are aiming
           at me, aren't you ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Carol ? Carol ? Carol ?
          Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections.
                         
                          GLADYS
           I'm aiming at you, lover.
                         
           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)
           Of course, killing you is killing myself.
                         
                          GLADYS
           Of course, killing you is killing myself.
                         
           ARTHUR (Everett Sloane - voice over from the film)
           It's the same thing.
                         
                          GLADYS
           But you know, I'm pretty tired of both of us.
                         
          She fired her gun twice
                         
          Medium shot on the many reflections of Paul. He fires his gun
          twice. We hear noises of mirrors being broken by the gunshots,
          both in the film, and on the backstage itself.
          Medium shot of Gladys and one of her reflections. She turns
          around, not being sure, because of the mirrors, of Paul's exact
          location.
                         
          Medium shot of Paul walking on the backstage. We still hears
          noises of mirrors being broken, but we don't know if the noises
          come from the film or the backstage.
                         
          Medium shot of Gladys and several of the reflections.
                         
          Medium shot of the floor of the backstage. We see the bottom of
          the screen and, of course, the film projected on it, and in which
          the mirrors are being broken. Paul enters from behind a mirror
          frame, and falls on the floor. Gladys' reflection appears in
          several mirrors. She stops and looks at Paul's body lying on the
          floor.
                         
          PAUL'S MOVIE HOUSE - OLD DRESSING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY
                         
          Medium close shot of Larry entering the room. He rushes to Carol,
          and takes her gag off.
                         
                          LARRY
           God ! Are you okay ? Are you okay ?
                         
          He hugs and kisses her.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God, Larry ! Oh, Larry, I'm so happy to see you !
                         
                          LARRY
           Jesus, I was, I was never so glad to see somebody in my
           life. Are you all right ?
                         
          He starts untying her hands.
                         
                          CAROL
           Yes, I'm all right.
                         
                          LARRY
           You don't know what's going on out there. I'll never say
           that life doesn't imitate art again. I'm... I'm... Oh,
           gee...
                         
                          CAROL
           We... we gotta call the police, Larry.
                         
                          LARRY
           Yes, and... and... and... a glazier.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know. Oh, God.
                         
                          LARRY
           Quick, quick. Dial, dial, dial.
                         
          He picks up the telephone, and Carol, whose hands are now
          completely free, starts dialing.
                          CAROL
           Larry. Oh, God, Larry. Oh, God. Oh, honey. Oh, God. Ow !
           Ow ! Oh, God ! Jesus !
                         
          Larry hugs and kisses her again.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, wife mine.
                         
          He takes the rope away, but he does it so nervously that he almost
          takes Carol's head off !
                         
                          CAROL
           Aow ! Aow !
           (talking in the phone)
           Hello ?
                         
                          LARRY
           Wife mine.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, God.

          Medium close shot on the top part of the door of the police
          station. A sign says : «4th precinct 621».
                         
          The camera tilts down. Three uniformed policemen are standing on
          the sidewalk near the door. Marcia and Ted come out of the
          station, and stop at the entrance.
                         
                          TED
           God, it's... it's so complicated. I can't... Can't keep
           track of it all.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Oh, listen. I'll give it to you one more time.
          Marcia takes a cigarette, and Ted lights it with his lighter.
                         
                         FLASHBACK SCENE
          PAUL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT
                         
          Medium shot. It's dinner time in Paul's apartment. Paul and
          Lilian's sister are seated around the table. Lilian comes in from
                         THE KITCHEN
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Mrs. House had a sister who moved to England many years
           ago.
                         
          Lilian gives a glass of wine to her sister.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           She changed her name when she married.
                         
          Lilian gives a glass of wine to Paul.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Her husband died. She moved back to New York recently, a
           very, very rich widow... but a recluse.
                         
          Lilian's sister has a heart attack. Paul helps her walk away from
          the table to the sofa.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Mr. and Mrs. House knew they weren't in her will. They have
           her over to dinner, she accidentally keels over. I guessed
           right there.
                         
          Lilian's sister is lying dead on the sofa, and Lilian, wearing a
          pink night-robe, is dressing her sister in her own clothes.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           She has a reasonable resemblance to her sister, so they
           fake it... Pretend Lillian House died. They cremate the
           sister.
                         
          The camera pans to Paul talking on the telephone.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           Lillian checks into a fleabag joint... and for several
           weeks she pretends to be her sister... closing her
           accounts, liquidating her assets, accumulating big money.
                         
          The camera pans back to the sofa, where Lilian is still dressing
          her sister.
                         
           MARCIA (voice over)
           What she didn't realize was that her husband was two-timing
           her with Helen Moss, this pretty model.
                         
          NEW-YORK - STREET IN FRONT OF THE POLICE STATION - EXTERIOR DAY
                         
          Back to the entrance of the police station, where Ted and Marcia
          are still talking. They start walking along the street.
                          MARCIA
           So, he decides not to cut her in and go off to... I don't
           know... With his mistress and, uh, keep all the dough. So,
           he kills Lillian. He cremates her, or pours molten steel
           all over her or something... and, uh, that's when we came
           along and tripped him up.
                         
          Medium shot of Ted and Marcia slowly walking behind the police
          cars parked near the station.
                         
                          TED
           He had some great alibis.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Yeah, that woman that worked for him ?
                         
                          TED

                          MARCIA
           Mrs. Dalton ? She covered for him. She loved him. Not that
           she dreamed he was a murderer.
                          TED
           What do you... What do you... I want, I want to celebrate,
           or something. What do you wanna do ? You wanna... Wanna go
           see what, uh, what Larry and Carol are up to ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           I think they wanna be alone.

           plans ?
                         
                          MARCIA
           You're taking me to dinner, right ?
                         
                          TED
           Yeah, right. Absolutely. Only we can't sleep together.
                         
                          MARCIA
           Why not ?

           not young and active like I used to be.
                         
                          MARCIA
           You'll do anything to catch a murderer, won't you ?

          Full shot of the corner of the street where Larry's building is
          located. The pavement is wet from a recent rain. Carol and Larry
          are coming around the corner of the street.
                         
                          LARRY
           What an experience.
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, really one.
                         
                          LARRY
           I'm... I'm still vibrating.
                         
                          CAROL
           I know.
                         
                          LARRY
           Incredible.
                         
          Carol, who was walking quite rapidly, suddenly slows down. Track
          shot of Larry and Carol, with the camera in front of them
                         
                          CAROL
           Oh, you know, Larry, you were surprisingly brave.
                         
                          LARRY
           What do you mean surprisingly ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           You seem shocked.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well...
                         
                          LARRY
           You know, I'm a pretty good guy, you know.
                         
                          CAROL
           Well, you know... Yeah, I know, uh...
                         
                          LARRY
           Where do you wanna go for dinner tonight ? Let's not go to
           any restaurant where they serve cowards.
                         
          Carol laughs.
                         
                          CAROL
           I don't know.
                         
                          LARRY
           I... What are you laughing at ?
                         
                          CAROL
           You know, Larry, I love you. I love you.
                         
                          LARRY
           How could you have ever been jealous of Marcia ? Isn't that
           ridiculous ? Don't you know that I could only love you ?

                          CAROL
           You were jealous of Ted.
                         
                          LARRY
           Ted ?
                         
                          CAROL
           Yeah.
                         
                          LARRY
           You've got to be kidding. Take away his-his-his elevator
           shoes and his fake suntan and his capped teeth... and what
           do you have ?
                         
                          CAROL
           You.
                         
          Larry laughs. They have reached their building and they enter it.
                         
                          LARRY
           Right. I love that.

                          CAROL
           I...
                         
          An attendant opens the door for them. Through the glass doors, we
          see them cross the lobby toward the elevator.

1   INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY                                          1

    A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The
    boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard
    tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This
    is Claude.

    We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle,
    balances it in one hand as he opens the door.

    The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.

    He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits
    while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above
    the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration
    alternating between the food and the path.

    He sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog.

                           CLAUDE
              Here.

    He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black
    circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly
    blushes and mumbles:

                           CLAUDE
              Sorry.

    He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next
    to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder
    length hair. Her name is Margot.

                        MARGOT
              That was quick.

                        CLAUDE
              I sat next to the wrong person.

                         MARGOT
              Really?   Where?
    She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her
    shirt.
                        CLAUDE
              Please don't look.    She'll see you.
                        MARGOT
              Careful with my blouse.

                                                             2.


2   CUT TO:                                                       2

    Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude
    listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up,
    and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes
    between cars.

    The train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops,
    looks around. He screams again.

3   CUT TO:                                                       3

    Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a
    river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.

    Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant.
    Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger
    against the glass and traces the wires.

                        CLAUDE
              Will the wedding be crowded?

                        MARGOT
              I don't know. I think she doesn't
              know anyone anymore.

                        CLAUDE
              How long has she known Malcolm?

                        MARGOT
              Only a year.

                        CLAUDE
              Is that short?

                        MARGOT
                  (pointedly)
              Would you marry someone you'd only
              known a year?
                        CLAUDE
              I'm not going to ever get married.
                        MARGOT
              I can't say I have a lot of hope
              for the whole thing.
                        CLAUDE
              Why are we going then?

                        MARGOT
              We're supporting her.

                                                               3.


                        CLAUDE
              I thought she wasn't speaking to
              you.

                        MARGOT
              No...no...I wasn't speaking to her,
              but I'm over it.

4   EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY                                           4

    A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs,
    clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun
    hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his
    shoulder.

5   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                                5

    The rumbling and sputtering of the boat.    People get out of
    their cars and stretch their legs.

    Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his
    face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She
    stuffs the phone in her pocket.

                        MARGOT
              Why aren't you wearing your new
              shades?

                        CLAUDE
              I don't think I need them right
              now.

                        MARGOT
              You begged for those glasses.

                        CLAUDE
              I know, but...I will wear them, I
              just feel like people might think
              it's weird that a kid is wearing
              dark shades.
                        MARGOT
              That's ridiculous.
    Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk
    sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self-
    consciously.
                        MARGOT
              You look very cool.
    He takes them off.

                                                             4.


                        CLAUDE
              I don't need them right now.

6   CUT TO:                                                       6

    Margot and Claude wait.   The ferry has emptied out.

                        CLAUDE
              Do they know we're here?

    A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops
    across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the
    backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down
    the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and
    sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.

                        MALCOLM
              Are you...?

7   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                              7

    Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is
    in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl,
    Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind.
    Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a
    panda on it.

                        MALCOLM
              Paul apologizes for not coming,
              she's still getting the house
              ready.

                        MARGOT
              I'm sorry it was such short notice.

                        MALCOLM
              I don't care. Paul's frantic, but
              I don't give a shit. Oh, and
              Ingrid wants me to tell you that
              she made us all bracelets.
                        INGRID
                  (embarrassed)
              No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...
                        MALCOLM
              Oh, I thought you asked me to tell
              them. Anyway...

    Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange
    bracelet.

                                                           5.


                    MALCOLM
          I got Knicks colors.

                    INGRID
          They're not Knicks colors!

                    MARGOT
          It's beautiful, Ingrid.

                    INGRID
              (to Claude)
          I made this one for myself.

She shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.

                    INGRID
          Yours is yellow. Is that okay?

                          CLAUDE
          I guess.

                    INGRID
          Where's your dad and Josh?

                    CLAUDE
          They might come later.

                    MARGOT
          Josh's spring break is next week.
          Jim teaches through Friday and then
          they open the house in Vermont on
          the weekend.

                    MALCOLM
              (bluntly)
          It means a lot to Pauline that
          you're here.

Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.
                          MARGOT
          Oh.     Good.
A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near
their car. Malcolm swerves anyway.
                    MALCOLM
          Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!
Ingrid giggles.    Margot clutches the handle above the door.

                                                                 6.


                        MALCOLM
              If you're wondering about the
              moustache --

                        MARGOT
              No, I wasn't.

                        MALCOLM
              I had a full beard   for a while and
              then when I shaved   it I left this
              part for last, you   know to see how
              it looked, and...    It's meant to be
              funny.

    Margot nods politely.   The sound of tires on gravel:

8   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  8

    The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway
    alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water.
    They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.

    Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her
    sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot
    smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips
    down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.

                        PAULINE
              You're so handsome.

    Now she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.   Claude beams.

                        PAULINE
              I never thought I'd get you here.

    A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A
    large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped
    into their yard. There's whispering and movement through
    brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with
    concern.
                        PAULINE
              You're arriving in the midst of a
              drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is
              inside.
    Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.
                        INGRID
              It's the Voglers.

                                                                7.


                        PAULINE
              The neighbors want us to cut down
              our tree.

    She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the
    adjoining property.

                        MARGOT
              No, that's our tree!

                        INGRID
              They think it's sick and rotting
              their property.

                        PAULINE
              We're having the ceremony under it.

                        MARGOT
              You took the swing down.

                        MALCOLM
              Pauline thinks this is their way of
              trying to be friends. I think they
              resent us because we're...

    He searches for the word, but can't come up with anything.
    He says wearily:

                        MALCOLM
              I don't know what we are.

9   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM/INGRID'S ROOM - DAY                     9

    Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his
    wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door
    opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto
    another bedroom.

    Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a
    realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.
                        INGRID
              This is my room.
                         CLAUDE
              Okay.
                        INGRID
              Do you like showers or baths?

                         CLAUDE
              Showers.   What about you?

                                                                8.


     Ingrid shrugs.   She says, already bored with the topic:

                         INGRID
               I don't care.

10   INT. STAIRWELL/MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    10

     Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now
     wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one
     another.

                         PAULINE
               Is Malcolm what you thought he'd
               be?

                         MARGOT
               Well, I didn't know what to --

                         PAULINE
               The moustache is temporary. He
               left it for last when he was
               shaving. It's meant to be funny.

                         MARGOT
               He told me.

                          PAULINE
               Yeah...

     They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the
     curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.

                         PAULINE
               I'm sorry -- with so little time to
               prepare, we had to put you in
               Malcolm's storage room --

                         MARGOT
               This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky.
                         PAULINE
               Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a
               storage room. I've just started to
               feel like it's our house not my
               parents. You know?
                         MARGOT
               Our parents.

                         PAULINE
               Of course. It might still smell
               like paint, but...

                                                           9.


                     MARGOT
           I thought he was a musician.

Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to
unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.

                     PAULINE
           Well, music's officially a hobby...
           He's painting now. And writing
           letters to newspapers and
           magazines. He's very meticulous,
           he'll spend up to a week writing a
           response to a music review. He's
           incredibly smart. Maybe too smart.
           I don't know. We're doing very
           well.

                       MARGOT
           Good.    I mean, you must be.

Silence.

                     PAULINE
           I don't know where to begin. What
           can I tell you? It seems I'm
           pregnant, but it's really early
           so... I haven't told anyone. I
           mean, I haven't told Malcolm or
           Ingrid.

                       MARGOT
           Wow...

                     PAULINE
           Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I
           hope so. Things are good. We did
           a couples seminar two months ago or
           so in Maine. They give you
           exercises and things to do. I know
           you're not convinced, but...
                     MARGOT
               (vaguely)
           Mm hm.
                     PAULINE
           We got engaged right afterwards.
           The guy who runs it, Strickland,
           wrote a really interesting book
           about loving which I'll lend you if
           you want.

                                                10.


                    MARGOT
              (non-committal)
          Okay.

                    PAULINE
          But only if you'll read it.
          Because I need it back. I made
          notes in the margins.

                    MARGOT
          I may not get to it for a while.

                    PAULINE
          Well, I'm not going to lend it to
          you if you're not going to read it.

They meet eyes.   Pauline quickly turns away.

                    PAULINE
          It's going to be very informal by
          the way. Just Mom and Becky.
          Malcolm's brother. Few friends.
          And now you and Claude. Nothing
          like the first one.

                     MARGOT
              (wary)
          Becky's coming?

                    PAULINE/MARGOT
          She isn't how you.../I'd really
          like...

                     PAULINE
          You go.

                    MARGOT
          I was going to say, "I'd really
          like some white wine."
                    PAULINE
          Oh. Yeah. We have a...
          Well...I'm glad you changed your
          mind and came. I never heard from
          you after I sent the invite...I
          even wondered if you got it.
                    MARGOT
              (quickly)
          Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
                    PAULINE
          Did you get it?

                                                               11.


                         MARGOT
               Yeah.

     Pauline waits for an explanation.

                         MARGOT
               I'm sorry you were so angry...

                         PAULINE
               I wasn't angry. I
               was...disappointed.

                         MARGOT
               Uh huh. But you see when you say,
               "disappointed" it puts me in a
               crummy situation. Like I let you
               down.

                         PAULINE
               But you did in a way.

                         MARGOT
               I don't see it like that.

                          PAULINE
               Fine. I felt betrayed.    Is that
               word okay?

                          MARGOT
               Again, you're making me the
               aggressor.

                          PAULINE
               You were the aggressor.
                   (pause)
               Let's not... I've become a really
               good cook.
11   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY                                 11
     Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his
     feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record
     sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little
     brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.

                         MARGOT
               I can't believe you've still got
               all of our old records.
     Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the
     scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and
     hands it to her mother.

                                                       12.


                    INGRID
          Mom, can you hide this please.

Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf.

                    PAULINE
              (for Margot's benefit)
          Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek
          once?

                    MALCOLM
          In the late `80's. It was a solo
          gig after he left the Cars.

                    CLAUDE
          So, you're kind of famous.

Malcolm reddens.

                    MALCOLM
          No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I
          used to want to be, but, No. Do
          you want to be famous?

                    MARGOT
          Claude wants to be very famous.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, make sure you can handle
          rejection. I can't. For me,
          expectation just turns to
          disappointment. So, ultimately I'd
          rather not try. It'll all go black
          for us soon enough anyway.

                    PAULINE
          Claude, ignore him.

Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with
an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows
uncomfortable. She says to Claude:

                    PAULINE
          When your mother moved to New York
          she used to send me books and
          records. She sent me REM's
          Murmur...
                    MARGOT
          And the Pixies.

                                                            13.


                   PAULINE
          And X. She was very cool your
          mother.

                    MARGOT
          You only liked top forty.

                    PAULINE
          Yeah, but I love REM now.

Margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes.

                    MARGOT
          I don't really listen to music
          anymore.

                    PAULINE
          I was dating that guy, Horace back
          then. Remember him?

                    MARGOT
          Was that the guy who liked to rough
          you up?

                    PAULINE
          No, that was our dad.

Pauline and Margot crack up laughing.   Malcolm raises an
eyebrow at Claude.

                    MARGOT
          Our father used to strip down to
          his skivvies and beat us with a
          belt.

                    MALCOLM
          That man had a sexual screw loose.

                    PAULINE
          It's awful -- that stuff that
          happens to kids. Malcolm was
          fondled by a male baby-sitter.
                    MALCOLM
          Just use that information however
          you want...
                     PAULINE
          Sorry. We're with family.     I
          figured...
Claude looks at Malcolm.   Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.

                                                              14.


                         PAULINE
               I think Becky got it the worst.

                          MARGOT
               Did she ever. Raped by the horse
               trainer...

     Margot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back
     into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream
     down Margot's face. Claude watches.

12   EXT. PATIO - NIGHT                                         12

     Malcolm, Pauline, Margot, Claude and Ingrid sit with a
     homosexual couple, Alan, 40's, and Toby, 30's, and their son,
     Bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup.
     Part of Alan's face is paralyzed.

                         TOBY
               Alan rolled over in bed and looked
               at me and he said I can't feel my
               face. It took three doctors before
               we knew it was Bells Palsy.

                         ALAN
               They say a brush of wind can do it.

                         TOBY
               Feeling is slowly coming back.

                         MALCOLM
               We're all getting older... Which
               is terrible -- I don't care how
               universal it is. I can't remember
               names anymore.

                         MARGOT
               I have that. I blank out on
               certain words now too. Like the
               other day, I couldn't remember the
               word for...
                   (laughs)
               I've forgotten it again. The stuff
               in wine. Sediment! That was it.

                         MALCOLM
               I know that. I was talking more
               about not remembering who was the
               bassist for Motley Crüe.
     Malcolm lights up a cigarette.   He offers one to Claude who
     shakes his head, No.

                                                            15.


                    PAULINE
          Ingrid, why don't you show Claude
          and Bruce the game trunk.

                    INGRID
          Okay.

Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce.      He looks back
longingly at the table of adults.

                     MALCOLM
              (relieved, to himself)
          Mick Mars.

                    MARGOT
          Toby, I think you need to have
          Bruce diagnosed.

                    TOBY
          Margot, I don't want to have this
          conversation with you.

We follow the kids inside.   We hear in the background:

                     MARGOT
          It's vital. If you keep telling
          him he's like everyone else he'll
          wonder why he isn't. He's
          suffering.

                     TOBY
          He's tested very well.    He does B's
          in school.

Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the
window. Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no
connection -- she goes back to Toby.

                    MARGOT
          But, that's how autism works. One
          part of the brain can work fine
          while the other is damaged.
                    ALAN
          We had him diagnosed, Margot.
          Nothing was found wrong.
                    MARGOT
          Did you really, though?
                    TOBY
          I'm...I'm not going to have this
          conversation. I'm sorry.

                                                              16.


     Silence.

                          MARGOT
                I know it must be so difficult for
                you, but I think you have to --

13   INT. KITCHEN - SAME                                          13

     Pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter.   She
     hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.

14   EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           14

     Margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb
     garden. She drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a
     joint. The bottle lies at her feet, three-quarters empty.

                          JIM'S VOICE
                What are you doing?

                          MARGOT
                I left you a note.

                          JIM'S VOICE
                Come back. Or meet me in Vermont
                on Saturday.

                           MARGOT
                No...no. The wedding is on
                Saturday. I'm here for that. I
                can't really pull out. How would
                that look?

                          JIM'S VOICE
                You haven't spoken to her in years -
                -

                          MARGOT
                Well, we're speaking now. She is
                my closest friend despite it all...
                You're the one who's been trying to
                get me to call her.
                          JIM'S VOICE
                Did you tell Claude what you're
                doing?
                          MARGOT
                    (suddenly laughing)
                Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's
                exactly what you'd imagine except I
                think he's clinically depressed.
                          (MORE)

                                                                17.

                         MARGOT (CONT'D)
               Not ugly, but completely
               unattractive. And he has no job.
               The best I can make out is that
               he's a letter writer. I don't
               know, the house looks weird to
               me...she's trying too hard and it's
               kind of a mess...they took down the
               swing...

     Silence on the other end.

                            MARGOT
               Hello?

                         JIM'S VOICE
               You said you weren't a hundred
               percent on this. You said that
               like a week ago. Can I come up
               there?

                         MARGOT
               No. I don't want to see you -- I
               feel happier already having done
               it.

                         JIM'S VOICE
               Really? You feel happier...
                   (silence)
               Please don't tell Claude anything
               please, until we've talked more.

                         MARGOT
               I need to tell him. And we need to
               tell Josh. Did he do his homework?

                            JIM'S VOICE
               Yes.

                         MARGOT
               This is happening and you have to
               get your mind around that.
15   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                             15
     Claude sleeps in bed.    Margot gently touches his face.   She
     whispers:
                         MARGOT
               Are you asleep?

                            CLAUDE
                      (softly)
               Yes.

                                                       18.


                    MARGOT
          Will you remember this?

                       CLAUDE
          Yes.

                    MARGOT
          I just talked to your dad...

Claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.

                    MARGOT
          I'm only going to tell you if you
          won't remember.

                       CLAUDE
          Okay.

Margot hesitates.    She changes her mind and says
thoughtfully:

                     MARGOT
          Everyone finds you so funny and
          charming. I always get compliments
          about you.

Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and
smears some eye make-up off of her face.

                    MARGOT
          Are you having fun?    Is it nice to
          see Pauline?

                    CLAUDE
              (opens his eyes)
          Yeah, I really like her.

                       MARGOT
          Yeah.     She is crazy though.
                    CLAUDE
          In what way?
                    MARGOT
          She's really berserk. Maybe it's
          hormones. You don't notice
          anything different about Pauline?
                       CLAUDE
          No.

                                                             19.


                         MARGOT
               She's pregnant -- she told me. But
               she's keeping it a secret -- I mean
               from Malcolm and even Ingrid.
               Which I think is unforgiveable.
               Now she'll have to marry him.
               What's she planning -- to get
               married and not drink champagne?
               Then she'll just be lying. I guess
               she's afraid she'll miscarry. She
               probably will. I think on some
               level she's ambivalent about the
               marriage and that's why she's not
               telling him.

                         CLAUDE
               Are you stoned, Mom?

                         MARGOT
               Maybe a little.

                         CLAUDE
               I don't like it.

16   INT. MALCOLM AND PAULINE'S ROOM - NIGHT                     16

     Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of
     whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.

                         MALCOLM
                   (shakes his head)
               My scrotum is longer than my penis.

     He turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of
     the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open.

                         MALCOLM
               It's sweet how Claude looks up to
               me.
     He waits for a reaction and gets none.

                         MALCOLM
               Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you
               made her out to be.
                         PAULINE
               What she did to Toby and Alan
               tonight didn't seem crazy enough
               for you?
                         MALCOLM
               I guess that seemed pretty crazy.

                                                        20.


                    PAULINE
              (immediately defensive)
          Well, she cares deeply.

                    MALCOLM
          Yeah, she's really worried about
          Bruce.

                    PAULINE
          This has nothing to do with Bruce.
          She thinks everyone is autistic.

Malcolm is about to speak, but instead he halts, paralyzed.

                    PAULINE
          What?

                    MALCOLM
          Nothing, you keep changing your
          position -- I'm just trying to
          figure out if I should agree with
          you or not?

                    PAULINE
          Well, can't she be both, care
          deeply and be crazy? Do people
          have to be all one thing?

                    MALCOLM
          I guess not.

                     PAULINE
          Well, okay...
              (back into it)
          It is nice she came for the
          wedding. She's so pretty, don't
          you think?

                    MALCOLM
              (warily)
          She's attractive.

                    PAULINE
          A little thin maybe...   But it is
          nice she came.
                    MALCOLM
          Let's fuck.

                                                                  21.


17   INT. MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - SAME                                17

     Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries
     to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and
     gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.

18   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                               18

     A croquet game in progress. Pauline and Malcolm play Margot
     and Claude. Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself.
     The dog next to her. Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully
     lines up his shot. Finally, he swings --

     The ball misses the wicket.    He shakes with frustration.

                          MALCOLM
               Fuck it!

     Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the
     neighbor's yard: A naked man, 40's, crouches. Arms extend
     from below and pull him downward. His ass pokes up over the
     weeds.

                         MARGOT
               Honey, you're up.

     Claude shakes out of his reverie. He walks briskly up to his
     ball and smacks it. It bullets forward and lands just short
     of Pauline's ball.

                         MARGOT
               Claude, don't just whack it.    Think
               about it before you hit.

                          CLAUDE
               Sorry.

     Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball
     down with her foot and prepares to swing.
                         MALCOLM
               Paul, what are you doing?
                         PAULINE
               I'm sending Claude's ball into the
               bushes.
                         MALCOLM
               Take the extra hit.

                         PAULINE
               I don't want to do that.

                                                         22.


                    MALCOLM
          It's the smarter play.

She whacks -- Claude's ball travels about two feet.

                       PAULINE
          Shit.

                    MALCOLM
          Pauline! See, I knew you
          couldn't... Your feet are too
          small!

Margot steps up to take her turn.   She regards the house.

                    MARGOT
          You took the awnings down.

Claude looks back into the adjacent yard: Flashes of skin. A
breast. Pubic hair. Claude crouches to see more clearly --
the bodies disappear from sight.

Malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes.
He swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a
ridge and onto the cement drive. It quickly sails down into
the road and bounces into a ditch.

Malcolm shakes furiously. He lifts his mallet, turns toward
the house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over the
incline and down to the water. Pauline puts her hands on her
hips.

                       PAULINE
          Well done.

                       MALCOLM
          Fuck you.

Malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach.
Claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.

                    MARGOT
          Honey, you're up.
He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double
wickets.
                    MARGOT
          You're going the wrong way.
                       CLAUDE
          Oh.

                                                                23.


     He blushes and laughs.    Pauline laughs.   Margot shakes her
     head.

                            MARGOT
               So stupid.

                         CLAUDE
               Mom, I'm sorry. Jesus.

     Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house.

                         CLAUDE
               We're in the middle of it.

                         MARGOT
               This is why I hate games.    I hate
               what it does to me.

     Pauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at
     her. Malcolm calls from the stairs:

                         MALCOLM (O.S.)
               Wait, we're not finished!

19   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                                19

     The five eat a salad nicoise lunch.

                         MARGOT
               Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline
               sometimes can't make eye-contact.
               How her gaze hovers just above your
               head.

                         MALCOLM
               Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.

                         MARGOT
               I always think I have something in
               my hair. It's not necessarily bad,
               Paul. It's just something you do.

     Pauline looks mildly horrified.   She suddenly turns to
     Claude.
                         PAULINE
               Claude have you ever seen your
               mother climb a tree?

                            CLAUDE
               No.

                                                                24.


                          MARGOT
               We don't have much opportunity in
               Manhattan.

                         PAULINE
               As kids Margot climbed everything.
               She could even climb that tree.

     She points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into
     the neighbor's property.

                         CLAUDE
               Can you do it, mom?

                         MARGOT
               Maybe later.

                          CLAUDE
               No, now.

                         INGRID
               Do it now, Margot!

                         PAULINE
               Show him, Margot.

20   CUT TO:                                                       20

     Margot strides toward the tree.   The group follows behind.

     She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself.

     Claude grins, impressed.

     With brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree.

     Claude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from
     below.

                         PAULINE
               I told you.
     Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the
     gang. They wave. She waves back.
     The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep
     breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The
     neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance,
     toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.

     An earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for
     a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more
     rapid.

                                                                25.


     A bug buzzes around her head.   She swats at it.

     Her family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a
     baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the
     table.

                         MARGOT
                   (under her breath)
               Shit.

     She wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked.    The
     buzzing continues.

     Close on Margot's ear. A small black gnat lands on the lip
     of the lobe. It hesitates and darts inside the hole.

     Margot gasps.   She jams her pinky in her ear.

     Pauline comes back out with an ice tea.

                         CLAUDE
               What's she doing now?

                         PAULINE
                   (dryly)
               She's stuck.

21   CUT TO:                                                      21

     A young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of
     the tree and toward Margot. He reaches out his hand to her.

                         MARGOT
                   (annoyed)
               I got it.

     She slowly lowers herself.

22   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       22
     Pauline is laughing, recounting the story. Claude and Ingrid
     laugh too. Margot shakes her head, embarrassed and furious.
                         CLAUDE
               You were great on the way up.
                         MARGOT
               Don't patronize me, Claude.
     Margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it.
                         PAULINE
               We're all laughing, Margot.

                                                               26.


                           MARGOT
                You're laughing in a kind way.
                Claude is taking too much pleasure
                out of it.

                            CLAUDE
                I am not.

                           MARGOT
                You are. You like to make fun of
                me. To see me get embarrassed.
                It's mean.

     Silence.   Margot puts her pinky back in her ear.   She frowns.

                          PAULINE
                What are you doing?

                          MARGOT
                I've got a fucking bug in my ear,
                okay?

23   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           23

     Pauline and Margot hike along a dirt trail. Claude and
     Ingrid idle behind, carrying walking sticks.

                           PAULINE
                I thought Claude could hand out
                programs. Ingrid's going to sing.
                Do you want to read a poem or
                something?

                          MARGOT
                You know I can't speak in front of
                people. I'm doing this
                "conversation" at the bookstore in
                town on Friday and I totally regret
                having said I'd do it.
                          PAULINE
                You're doing a "conversation?"
                          MARGOT
                Yeah, talking about my work in
                front of a crowd. I didn't invite
                you because...I thought it'd be
                boring.

                            PAULINE
                Uh huh.

                                                        27.


                      MARGOT
          What?    Say it.

                     PAULINE
          It's nothing. It's just...I would
          come...I want to come. I get a
          kick out of it. It's just weird,
          you know... So, you're not here
          for...
               (she stops herself)
          Okay, I get it. When did they ask
          you?

                    MARGOT
          A while ago. I'd said, No, but
          then when I was coming here anyway
          and...I guess it helps sales
          and...so...so.

                      PAULINE
          I see.

We catch a quick glimpse of people walking ahead in the path.

                    PAULINE
          Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes
          tied.

                    MARGOT
          Why? Is she seeing someone?   She's
          still obese, I assume.

                    PAULINE
          I think it's symbolic.

                     MARGOT
          I bet mom paid for it.   We should
          audit mom.

                    PAULINE
          I considered it in my twenties.
          You know, when I was fucking
          everyone. You remember.
                    MARGOT
          I did my share.
                    PAULINE
          But not like me.

                    MARGOT
          You want to count?

                                                         28.


                    PAULINE
          No, Margot, I don't want to count.
              (pause)
          What was it about Dad that had us
          fucking so many guys?

                    MARGOT
          I think it was the only time we
          could really feel unselfconscious
          and get out of our heads.

                    PAULINE
              (dismissive)
          I don't think that's it. I just
          think it was something we were good
          at.

Behind, Ingrid smacks her walking stick into Claude's.

                    INGRID
          Your mom thinks Bruce is gay.

                    CLAUDE
          No, she said she had Aspergers.

                    INGRID
          I thought that's what that means.

                    CLAUDE
          No, it's like lesser retarded.

                    INGRID
          I have adult ADD.

                    CLAUDE
          You mean child ADD.

                    INGRID
          No, for some reason I have the
          adult one. Maybe I'm retarded.
Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year
old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt
and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little
girl whines and lags behind.
Margot and Pauline slow down.   Claude and Ingrid catch up.
                     MAN
          Come on!
                    LITTLE GIRL
          I don't want to!

                                                        29.


                     MAN
          Come on!

                    LITTLE GIRL
          I don't want --

The woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her.
The girl screams.

                     MARGOT
          Hey!

The man and woman turn around sharply.

                    MARGOT
          Be careful!

                     WOMAN
          What?

                    MARGOT
          Be careful the way you pull on that
          child's arm. You'll take it out of
          its socket.

                    MAN
          Don't tell us how to treat our
          child.

                    MARGOT
          I don't care how you treat your
          child as long as you don't hurt
          him.

                    PAULINE
              (under her breath)
          It's a girl.

                    WOMAN
          She threw a rock at me.
                    MARGOT
          She's a little girl!
                    WOMAN
          She knew what she was doing.
She starts suddenly toward Margot.
                    WOMAN
          There is no hitting in our family.
          Do you understand?

                                                                   30.


     Margot backs up quickly.    The woman stops about ten feet
     away.

                         WOMAN
               Stay out of it, bitch.

     The woman turns back around. She lifts the girl into her
     arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight.

                         INGRID
               That was the Voglers.

                         PAULINE
               Jesus, Margot, what are you doing.
               They already hate us.

                         MARGOT
                   (wiping her eyes)
               Don't tell me what I can and can't
               do. That's child abuse.

                         CLAUDE
               Mom, she was psychotic.

                         MARGOT
               Stop picking on me.    Everyone.

24   CUT TO:                                                         24

     The four of them emerge into a clearing.     Nobody speaks.    A
     child's pink sneaker lies in the path.

                         MARGOT
               Oh God.

     Pauline walks over to it.    She crouches.

                         PAULINE
               It could be anyone's.
     Margot bursts into tears.    Pauline hesitates then holds her.

                         INGRID
               What are they going to do to us?
                         PAULINE
               They're not going to do anything,
               honey.

25   EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY                                          25
     Malcolm looks at Pauline. He's in the midst of writing a
     letter on a legal pad. Pauline is worked up.

                                                         31.


                    PAULINE
          We have to cut down that tree.

                    MALCOLM
          Where are we going to get married
          then?

                    PAULINE
          I don't...we'll do it in the
          fucking drive-way if we have to.

Claude and Ingrid listen from just inside the house.   Ingrid
looks at Claude nervously.

                    INGRID
          Your mom started a war. We have to
          make sure we wear shoes because
          they might start throwing glass.

                    CLAUDE
          Has that happened before?

                    INGRID
          I can't remember. I think so. No,
          it definitely has. Now I remember.

Behind them, Margot, made-up and wearing a dress, clomps down
the stairs, across the carpet and onto the porch.

                    PAULINE
          Where are you going?

                    MARGOT
              (tersely)
          To town. I'll be back for dinner.

                    PAULINE
          Come on, nobody blames you, Margot.

An old orange BMW idles at the end of the driveway. Pauline,
Malcolm, Claude and Ingrid watch Margot cross the drive-way.
A man, 50's, opens the passenger door. He smokes a brown
cigarette. Margot gets in. The man waves at the group on
the patio. Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid and Claude wave back.
                    CLAUDE
          Is that Dick Koosman?
                     PAULINE
          Yeah.   He has a house up here.

                                                              32.


                         CLAUDE
               What's he doing with mom?

                         PAULINE
               Good question.

26   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              26

     Ingrid sits at the roots of the tree, squeezing honey out of
     a honey bear onto her hand -- she watches the ants come.
     Claude sits on a low branch and looks over the fence:

                         INGRID
               How much do your parents make in a
               year?

                         CLAUDE
               I think about a hundred.    They bank
               at Chase.

     The front door of the Vogler's opens and a boy, 14, pees from
     the entrance-way into the plants in the yard.

                         INGRID
               Are they rich?

                          CLAUDE
               No.   They're middle class.

     The boy finishes and violently hurls a toy car at the fence.

                         BOY
               Just let me live!

     The toy lands a few feet short.   He goes inside and closes
     the door.

                         INGRID
               Upper or lower?
                         CLAUDE
               I think just middle.
     Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the
     Vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail. He stumbles,
     recovers and flings the animal at the front door.   He races
     back toward his property.
27   EXT. PORCH - EVENING                                          27

     Margot and Malcolm have cocktails. Pauline drinks a bottled
     water. Ingrid has cray pas, markers and paper and draws at a
     table. She draws a mole.

                                                           33.

Claude draws a boy with a big claw for a hand and CLAWED
under it. Wizard, the dog, lies at his feet.

                    MARGOT
          Dick and his daughter asked us over
          to swim tomorrow.

                    PAULINE
          We didn't invite them to the
          wedding.

                    MARGOT
          You're not really friends.

                    PAULINE
          We're friends enough that's it's
          awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us
          all the time.

                    MARGOT
          He's doing the interview with me in
          town on Friday. Did I tell you, he
          and I are collaborating on a
          screenplay, an adaptation of one of
          Dick's novels.

                    PAULINE
          No, I didn't even know you knew he
          was up here.

Malcolm takes one of Ingrid's markers and doodles.

                    MALCOLM
          Is he even a good writer?    Why do
          people care about him?

                    PAULINE
          You're competitive with everyone.
          It doesn't matter if they even do
          the same thing as you.
              (to Claude)
          He's competitive with Bono.

                    MALCOLM
          It's true. I don't subscribe to
          the credo that there's enough room
          for everyone to be successful. I
          think there are only a few spots
          available and people like Dick
          Koosman and Bono are taking them
          up.

Pauline looks at Malcolm's drawing.    It's a graphic image of
a man fucking a woman in the ass.

                                                                34.


                          PAULINE
               Malcolm, what would ever make you
               think that's something to draw
               right now?

     Claude and Ingrid stare at it.    Malcolm balls it up.

                         MALCOLM
               Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it.
               Sorry, Margot.

28   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                               28

     The car pulls into a driveway.    A modern house.   Dick and
     Maisy come out to greet them.

                         DICK
               You found it!

     Margot, the kids and Pauline get out. We stay in the car
     with Malcolm. Pauline comes to his window.

                            PAULINE
               What's up?

                         MALCOLM
               I don't want to do this...

                         PAULINE
               Come on, don't be that way.

     Maisy sits on the hood of the car and Ingrid introduces her
     to Claude. Dick approaches Margot -- she turns back to
     Pauline.

                         MALCOLM
               I'm not being that way -- I just
               don't feel like it. I'm going to
               go back and... I have work to do.
                         PAULINE
               Dick doesn't care that you don't
               make any money.
                         MALCOLM
               Is that why you think... That's
               not why I'm...I just hate swimming.
               I really hate it. It's disgusting
               to me. My mistake was saying I'd
               do it to begin with. You have fun.
                         PAULINE
               Fine, we'll have fun.

                                                                35.


     Malcolm's gaze goes to Maisy's breasts.    Margot watches him
     watch her.

                         MALCOLM
               People always pee in the pool.

                         PAULINE
               I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in
               their pool.

                         MALCOLM
               I'll bet you 500 dollars there's
               pee in that pool.

29   EXT. DICK'S POOL - DAY                                       29

     Pauline and Margot float beneath Claude who stands above
     them.

                         PAULINE
               To the end and back.   Claude, you
               say Go.

                         CLAUDE
               Okay.

     Margot knocks on the side of her head with her hand.

                         CLAUDE
               Go!

     Pauline flings herself in and is off. Margot hesitates then
     follows. Maisy and Dick watch from the chairs. Ingrid
     floats on a raft and cheers. Claude runs along the pool-
     side.

                         DICK
               How's your dad?

                         CLAUDE
               Good.
                         DICK
               He and I shared a thesis advisor at
               Stanford. Did you know that?
                         CLAUDE
               No.
     Pauline hits the far wall with her palm and flips around.
     Margot stops short and follows her sister. They're neck and
     neck. Their arms cut in and out of the water.

                                                               36.


                     DICK
           I was dating your mom back then,
           did you know that?

                      CLAUDE
           No.

Pauline lands -- touches the wall first.    Margot a close
second.

                     CLAUDE
           Pauline wins!

Pauline beams. Margot immediately drifts to the ladder.
She's panting heavily.

                     CLAUDE
           Mom cheated. You didn't touch the
           wall!

                     MARGOT
           I did so. It doesn't matter.     I
           lost anyway.

                     PAULINE
           It was close.

Pauline floats on her back, exhausted.

Ingrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up
from beneath the surface.

Margot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel.
For a moment it's an embrace. Margot looks quickly over at
Claude --

His foot slips.

He topples in.
Water roars around him.

He opens his mouth.   Bubbles spurt out.
He drifts down.
Lying next to the drain is a field mouse.       Its eyes are
white.

Splash.   Hands wrap around him.
He goes up.

                                                                37.


     The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer.

     Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the
     ladder. She helps him climb out. Ingrid and Maisy are
     grinning. Their expressions slowly shift as they see
     Claude's face.

     Claude is sobbing.

                            PAULINE
               It's okay.

     Margot immediately wrenches Claude from Pauline's grasp.    She
     looks shocked and angry.

                            MARGOT
               I got him.

     She leads her son behind the bushes out of everyone's sight.

                         MARGOT
               It's okay, my baby.

     She gently lets him down. His sneakers squeak and slosh.
     Claude, soaking wet and ashamed, looks at his mother. She
     breaks into laughter. Claude wipes the water and tears from
     his eyes.

                         CLAUDE
               I'm sorry I laughed about the tree.

                         MARGOT
               Now we're even.

30   INT. PAULINE AND MALCOLM'S DEN - DAY                         30

     Margot, reclining on the couch, drinks a white wine with ice
     cubes. Pauline passes the doorway and stops. She holds tear-
     sheets of flowers and wedding decorations from various
     magazines.
                         PAULINE
               Here you are.
                         MARGOT
               You've got a problem.
                         PAULINE
               What do you mean?

                         MARGOT
               I don't like the girl and I don't
               like the way Malcolm looks at her.

                                                       38.


                    PAULINE
          Oh, come on, it's sexy.

                    MARGOT
          You didn't see it. I saw it.
          You've got a problem.

                    PAULINE
          I'm not worried.
              (pause)
          We could teach Claude how to swim.

                    MARGOT
          He won't want to do it.   It's too
          late.

Pauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple
steps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass.
Margot passes it to her. Pauline sips.

                    MARGOT
          Are you supposed to be doing that?

                     PAULINE
          No.

She hands it back.

                    PAULINE
          I liked your last story in, was it
          Harpers? The one about mom. I was
          very...I liked it very much.

                    MARGOT
          It wasn't really about mom.

                    PAULINE
          I thought it was. Anyway. Why
          don't you want Claude to know how
          to swim?
                    MARGOT
          I didn't say I didn't want him to.
          Why do you care? It's not in his
          life -- we're New Yorkers. If he
          wants to learn when he's older, he
          can. I'm curious why you're so
          interested in the whole thing.
                    PAULINE
          I'm not. I'm just... As a safety
          thing and...I'm... Forget it.
              (pause)
                    (MORE)

                                                             39.

                         PAULINE (CONT'D)
               It's interesting -- this is the
               first time Dick has invited us
               over.

                         MARGOT
               But are you really friends?

                         PAULINE
               Kind of. We're neighbors. We
               employ Maisy. I mean I don't care,
               I just think it's interesting.
                   (pause)
               Are you excited about the talk? I
               thought I'd come if that's okay.
               My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's
               it like to have a celebrity as a
               sister?" I said, I've got no
               problem with celebrity. Alice
               Munro taught at Bennington and was
               kind of a friend of mine.

                         MARGOT
               I'm not a celebrity.

                         PAULINE
               Well, you're well known.

                         MARGOT
               To a very few people.

                         PAULINE
               Just accept the compliment.

                         MARGOT
               I guess I didn't realize it was a
               compliment.

31   EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY                                     31

     Margot walks the path alone. She hugs herself as a light
     breeze kicks up. Her footsteps echo in the trees.
     The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt.
     She crouches down and takes it.
32   CUT TO:                                                    32
     CLOSE: A note is being written.

     "...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your
     child I will call the police."

                                                               40.


     The word "any" is then underlined twice.   The page is torn
     from her little brown book.

33   EXT. VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING                                   33

     Margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door.
     She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and
     holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around
     to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window:

     It's a white tiled bathroom.

     A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced
     on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass
     is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs.

     Mrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the
     water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs
     against him.

     Margot chews her cuticle.

     The man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth,
     straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his
     temples.

     Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the
     window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces
     the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the
     floor.

     Margot moves to another window.   The pig's face now looks at
     her.

     Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The
     woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid.

     Suddenly a face appears in the glass. Margot leaps back.
     It's a thin boy. He says something. The family turns to the
     window. The father flicks off the bathroom light.
     From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition.
     Margot scampers into the trees.   She pushes through branches,
     her shirt tears. She runs.
34   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - EVENING                            34
     Claude sits on the bed. The record sleeve from Blondie's
     "Parallel Lines" rests in his lap. He reads the lyrics to
     the song, "Sunday Girl." He depresses the red record button
     on an old portable tape recorder. He sings a cappella and
     full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can.

                                                              41.


     Maisy appears in the doorway and watches.   Claude turns mid-
     lyric. He jumps, startled.

                            MAISY
               Singing?

     Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.

                            CLAUDE
               Hm?     A bit.

     She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who
     remains on the bed.

     Margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape.
     She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's
     hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth
     stomach.

                         MAISY
               Can I make a suggestion?

                            CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

                         MAISY
               You should get underarm deodorant.

                            CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

                         MAISY
               You kind of smell.

     Claude blushes.

                         MAISY
               Better I tell you than someone
               else.
35   INT. MARGOT'S BATHROOM - EVENING                           35

     Margot puts on mascara and watches Claude, who stands behind
     her, in the mirror.
                         MARGOT
               I think you smell nice.    You smell
               real.

                            CLAUDE
               I stink.

                                     42.


          MARGOT
It causes cancer.

          CLAUDE
Underarm deodorant?

          MARGOT
Yes. It's got chemicals and things
that are extremely harmful.

          CLAUDE
I'm not going to die from underarm
cancer.

           MARGOT
No, you'll get it somewhere else.
Like your stomach or your
testicles.

           CLAUDE
    (laughs)
Testicles.

          MARGOT
Don't laugh, that's a serious
thing.
Who told you this, anyway? Maisy?

          CLAUDE
Yeah.

          MARGOT
I hope you're not interested in
that girl. I find her
insufferable.

          CLAUDE
What does that mean?

          MARGOT
It means I can't suffer her. She's
loud and stupid. She goes on about
things of which she knows nothing
about.
          CLAUDE
She got into Harvard early.
          MARGOT
Stupid people get into Harvard
early all the time.

                                                             43.


                         CLAUDE
               Where did you go again?

                         MARGOT
               Barnard.
                   (pause)
               I just don't think you should do
               anything with her.

                         CLAUDE
                   (embarrassed)
               We're just friends.

                         MARGOT
               If you do, use a condom.

     Claude looks into the toilet. A square of toilet paper with
     a red lip outline floats on top of the water.

                         CLAUDE
               Where are you going?

                         MARGOT
               Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick.

                         CLAUDE
               Are kids coming?

36   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  36

     Claude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back
     seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The
     ignition turns.

     Claude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away.
     Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of
     them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a
     stalk of celery.

                         INGRID
               Who do we know who's gay?
                         MAISY
               How do I know what gay people you
               know.
                         CLAUDE
               Alan and Toby.
                            INGRID
               And Bruce.     He's gay and Aspergers.

                                                      44.


                    CLAUDE
          I don't know if Bruce is gay.

                    INGRID
          He might be, it's very common.

                    CLAUDE
          Your mom is pregnant.

                    INGRID
          No she isn't.

                       CLAUDE
          She is.

Ingrid looks stricken.

                    MAISY
          How do you know that, Claude?

                    CLAUDE
          She told my mom. But you can tell -
          - she's hormonally weird.

                    MAISY
          Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to
          have a baby sister or brother.

                    INGRID
              (quietly)
          My mom thinks your mom is
          unreliable.

                       CLAUDE
          Who cares.

But he does. Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on
the crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude:

                    MAISY
          Do you think your mom is fuckable?
                    CLAUDE
          I don't know.
                    MAISY
          I think she's hot, your mother.
          I'd do her if I was gay. I might
          anyway. I mean if she came on to
          me.
                       CLAUDE
          She won't.

                                                               45.


                         INGRID
               I'm not going to do anyone.

     There's a scraping sound on the window.   The kids turn
     quickly:

                         CLAUDE
               What was that?

                         INGRID
               Is it scary?

37   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                                          37

     The three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats
     in the fence: The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table. A
     pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. Mrs. Vogler says
     something and the kids and Mr. Vogler laugh.

     Maisy climbs over Claude to see better. He feels her breasts
     press against his back. Suddenly he swats crazily at his
     ear. Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass.

38   INT. VOLVO - NIGHT                                          38

     Malcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him. He's
     smoking with the window open, Dick and Margot in the
     backseat.

                         PAULINE
               Margot used to never speak. I
               remember when we went on a double
               date in high school, that kid Ron
               asked you if English was your first
               language.

                         MARGOT
               It's true. I used to think I might
               have some kind of brain defect.
                         PAULINE
               You thought you were aphasic.
                         MARGOT
               I'm still not sure.
                         PAULINE
               Oh, Jesus, Margot.
                         MARGOT
               It's very possible, Paul.

                                                        46.


                    PAULINE
          I just...your diagnoses sometimes
          irk the hell out of me.

Malcolm lights another cigarette -- the car jerks sideways.

                    MARGOT
          Malcolm, can you slow down.

                    MALCOLM
          What?

                    DICK
          I can drive if you like.

                    MALCOLM
          No, you got dinner, the driving's
          on me.

                    DICK
          Well, I'll let you pay your half if
          you'll slow down.

                    MALCOLM
          Well, neither Pauline or I ordered
          dessert.

                    PAULINE
          Malcolm, let it go.
              (taunting)
          Margot would insist on driving if
          she knew how.

                     MARGOT
               (to Dick)
          My license elapsed.   But I know
          how.

                    MALCOLM
          It's probably for the best. I have
          this theory, I think, historically,
          women have been held back in so
          many ways that when they get power,
          like they do behind the wheel, they
          can't help but abuse it. It's akin
          to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory
          about prison guards and prisoners
          switching rolls.
                    DICK
          That's a charming philosophy.

                                                           47.


                     MARGOT
          Yeah.   Tell that one a lot.

                    MALCOLM
          This isn't a blanket thing. I
          mean, women can be great drivers
          too...

He takes a long satisfied drag on his cigarette.

                    PAULINE
          Said the man with the moustache
          that he thinks he's wearing in
          quotes.

                    MARGOT
          It's meant to be funny.

                    MALCOLM
              (to Pauline, re: Margot)
          Are you doing this for her benefit
          or mine?

Malcolm pumps the brake.

                    MALCOLM
          What the fuck?

                      PAULINE
          What?

                    MALCOLM
              (momentarily sober)
          No, there they go. Okay. It's
          fine. I thought I had no brakes
          for a minute...

Malcolm pitches his cigarette out the window -- it flies
through Margot's window and lands on her lap.
                      MARGOT
          Malcolm!
Dick grabs the lit butt and chucks it in the road.
                    MALCOLM
              (turning around)
          What?!

The car swerves again -- everyone jumps.
                      MARGOT
          Watch it!

                                                              48.


                         MALCOLM
               It's fine, Margot!

                         PAULINE
                   (to Malcolm)
               You're just so incompetent.

                         MALCOLM
                   (exploding)
               Why don't you fucking drive
               yourselves home!

     Malcolm screeches the vehicle over to the shoulder.   They
     jolt to a stop.

                         PAULINE
                   (quietly furious)
               Oh, God.

     Pauline opens the door and staggers toward the brush. She
     leans against a tree and looks like she might vomit. Malcolm
     watches in the rearview mirror.

                         MARGOT
               You should go after her.

     Malcolm sighs heavily and gets out of the car. Margot and
     Dick watch out the back window. Pauline sees Malcolm coming
     and bolts into the woods. Malcolm charges after her.

                         DICK
               Come back with me tonight.

                         MARGOT
               I've got Claude.

                         DICK
               Come on, I've been trying to get
               you up here all year.
                         MARGOT
                   (vaguely)
               She's pregnant.
     Dick leans over to Margot's neck.    He licks her.
39   INT. INGRID'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   39
     Claude lies in bed with Ingrid. He chews off a piece of his
     pinky fingernail. He hesitates and places it on an end-
     table.

                                                       49.


                    INGRID
          Why are you putting that there?

                    CLAUDE
          I just want to keep it.

                    INGRID
          I left a piece of skin in a movie
          theater once so it could watch
          movies all its life.

                    CLAUDE
          I don't know if it's the same
          thing.

                    INGRID
          Are you obsessed with Maisy?

                     CLAUDE
          No.

                    INGRID
          You're always staring at her tits.

Ingrid traces Claude's upper lip with her finger.

                    INGRID
          You have a moustache.

                    CLAUDE
          My mom bleaches it.

                    INGRID
          I'm going to kiss your cheek and
          then you kiss mine.

                    CLAUDE
          I don't want to do that.

                     INGRID
          Why not?
                    CLAUDE
          Because it's pointless...
Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door
and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and
dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into
the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water
groans through the old pipes.

                                                              50.


                         INGRID
               Where are you going? I thought we
               were having a conversation.

                         CLAUDE
               You're starting to annoy me.

40   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                    40

     Claude walks -- he passes an open door: Malcolm is shaving
     his moustache -- the electric razor whirring.

41   INT. MARGOT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              41

     Claude enters.   It's empty. Her brown notebook rests on the
     bedside table.   He hesitates then opens it:

     It's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive
     in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page.

     Claude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles
     against the pillow and squints to read the writing.

                         MARGOT (O.S.)
               What are you doing?

     Claude startles.   Margot stands in the doorway with a glass
     of water.

                         CLAUDE
               I didn't think you came home.

                         MARGOT
               Where would I be?

                         CLAUDE
               Can't Josh and Dad come to the
               wedding?

                         MARGOT
               We've been through this.    Go to
               bed.
     Claude slides down to the floor.    He hesitates.
                         CLAUDE
               Can I sleep in here?
                            MARGOT
               No, honey.
                         CLAUDE
               We can put a pillow between us.

                                                              51.


                          MARGOT
               Okay.   Just for tonight.

     Claude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in
     the bed. We stay on him as he waits. Finally Margot climbs
     into the covers in a nightgown.

                         MARGOT
               When you were a baby I wouldn't let
               anyone else hold you. I think that
               may have been a mistake.

42   EXT. HOUSE - MORNING                                       42

     Malcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his
     mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white
     tent. A workman holds a pole steadily.

     Pauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. Ingrid
     idles a few feet away. They're in the midst of talking:

                         INGRID
               Why was it a secret?

                         PAULINE
               Because I didn't want to get you
               excited before it was real. It's
               not really a baby yet. In two more
               weeks we can celebrate together,
               okay?

                         INGRID
               Why did you tell Margot?

                         PAULINE
               Because she's my sister and I trust
               her. How do you feel about it?

                         INGRID
               I don't want a sister.
     Pauline touches Ingrid's hair gently.
                         INGRID
               I'm going to go get Wizard.
     She runs toward the house.   Pauline marches toward Malcolm.
                         PAULINE
               Margot told Claude something I
               expressly told her in confidence.
               And he told Ingrid.
                         (MORE)

                                                   52.

                    PAULINE (CONT'D)
          I'm stunned that she put me in this
          position. It's so fucking
          infuriating.

                    MALCOLM
          Well it's that thing where--

                    PAULINE
          Don't say anything. You know
          what...just be there for me.
          Silently.

                    MALCOLM
          Okay.

                    PAULINE
          Why do I have to be so careful
          around her, but everyone is allowed
          to make fun of me?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't know if --

                     PAULINE
          Malcolm, what did I just say?
              (sighs)
          You know, I just want you to take
          my side, I don't need you to make
          it better.

Malcolm puts his hand awkwardly on her shoulder.

                    PAULINE
          Ingrid's really upset about it.
          Fuck. I can't believe she did this
          to me!
              (pause)
          I didn't tell you because... I
          didn't want you to feel like you
          had to marry me. I found out right
          before our seminar... I'm
          pregnant.
                    MALCOLM
          Uh huh.
                    PAULINE
          Well...does that sound good to you?
                    MALCOLM
          I'm still digesting Margot telling
          Claude. What a fucking nut job.
              (quickly)
          Sorry. I think I'm really happy.

                                                              53.


     Ingrid is watching from across the field.

                         PAULINE
               Come here, honey!

     Ingrid hurries through the sparkly, dewy grass.   Pauline hugs
     her and they spin.

43   CUT TO:                                                     43

     Margot watches from the upstairs window. The mother and
     daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle.
     Finally, Margot turns away -- she's in Pauline and Malcolm's
     room.

     She opens drawers: Underwear, socks, bras. Topless photos
     of Pauline posing in the bedroom. A photograph of Margot and
     Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar
     and Patty Smyth respectively.

     Margot grins.

     Another photo of Margot, Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky -
     - in their 20's.

     Margot's expression saddens. She opens another drawer.
     Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses.

     She flips through these and drops them on the bureau.

     Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers.
     She squints to read the labels. She opens one and shakes out
     a few blue pills into her palm. She swallows one and puts
     the rest in her pocket.

     More drawers open: Self-help books, incense, pamphlets on
     Buddhism. A stack of pornographic DVD's.

                         CLAUDE (O.S.)
               Hey.
     Margot starts and shoves the drawer shut.
                         MARGOT
               Hey. I'm just looking at Pauline's
               incense and self-help books. I
               don't understand it. This junk
               makes her look stupid and she's
               not. I don't like to think of her
               this way.

                         CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

                                                             54.


                         MARGOT
               She's such a hypocrite. Somehow
               I'm a kook for going to therapy,
               but she's got enough drugs here to
               medicate a...
                   (settles on a word)
               ...an elephant. And she's always
               with these losers.

                         CLAUDE
               Malcolm's not a loser.

                         MARGOT
               Claude...think about it.

                            CLAUDE
               He's cool.

                         MARGOT
               What makes you think he's cool?
                   (softens)
               I'm more talking about her
               investment in things like the Forum
               and ashrams.

                         CLAUDE
               What's the Forum?

                         MARGOT
               Like a cult.

                         CLAUDE
               She was in a cult?

                         MARGOT
               Years ago. She and Lenny also
               followed some guru who was a
               follower of the Mukdananda who made
               her drink his bath water. Who
               knows what she's doing now.
                          INGRID (O.S.)
               Margot!   Claude!
44   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          44
     Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds.
                            CLAUDE
               Wizard!
     We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell:

                                                         55.


                      PAULINE/INGRID
          Wizard!    Wiz!

Margot enters the frame.   The kids walk ahead.

                      MARGOT
          Wizard!    Here, boy!

She stands a few feet away from Pauline.   The kids can be
heard shouting in the distance.

                    MARGOT
          How long has he been gone?

                    PAULINE
          I don't know. Ingrid brought him
          in last night, but we couldn't find
          him this morning.

                      MARGOT
          Oh boy.

                    PAULINE
          Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant?

                    MARGOT
          I don't know.

                      PAULINE
          You did.

                    MARGOT
          I guess I said something.

                    PAULINE
          You did. You don't have to tell
          him everything.

                    MARGOT
          He wants to know. If I don't tell
          him, he figures it out.

                    INGRID (O.S.)
          Where is Wizard?
Ingrid approaches with Claude.
                    PAULINE
          I don't know, honey.
Ingrid sinks into her mother's body.   Claude and Margot walk
ahead.

                                                             56.


                         CLAUDE
               You didn't let him go out into the
               road or something where something
               could've happened to him?

                         MARGOT
               Why would you think I'd do
               something like that? That's awful.

                           CLAUDE
               I just...    I'm just making sure.

                         MARGOT
               That's a terrible thing to say to
               me.

                         CLAUDE
               I didn't mean on purpose, I just
               meant maybe in case...you knew
               something. I'm sorry.

45   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                         45

     Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a
     white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled.

                           MARGOT
               Woa!

     Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a
     pad and paper in front of him.

                         MALCOLM
               Hey, sorry. I'm here.

                           MARGOT
               No, I...    I should've looked.

                         MALCOLM
               I'm just writing my vows. Trying
               to do something appropriate but
               also funny -- not jokey, more
               character based humor.
     Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm
     to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a
     long drink. Silence.
                         MALCOLM
               You having an okay time?
                           MARGOT
               Oh, yeah.    Besides Wizard getting --

                                                 57.


                     MALCOLM
           Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or
           else, I don't know...

                       MARGOT
           We won't.

                      MALCOLM
           Right, or else he's dead or
           something.
               (pause)
           It means a lot to Paul that you
           came.

                       MARGOT
           Yeah.

Silence.   Malcolm mumbles a tune.

                     MARGOT
           Oh God, this is the same toaster we
           had here as kids. Paul is so
           weird.

                     MALCOLM
           I hear you've heard the news.

                      MARGOT
           Yeah.   Congratulations.

                     MALCOLM
           Pretty cool. Hard to fully take
           in. It's a little abstract still.
           I haven't had that thing yet where
           you realize that you're not the
           most important person in the world.
           I'm anxious for that to happen. I
           guess I have to thank you -- I
           wouldn't know yet if you hadn't
           arrived.
                     MARGOT
           You're welcome.
                     MALCOLM
           Of course I can't help but worry
           I'll pass some not so great genes
           onto the kid. I mean, in my family
           there's a lot of hand washing, you
           know. I don't have it, but my
           brother does.
               (pause)
           You working on anything now?

                                                          58.


                     MARGOT
           Besides the thing with Dick?

                        MALCOLM
           Oh, right.

He nods.   She nods.    Silence.

                     MARGOT
           How about you?

                     MALCOLM
           Oh, I'm working on some acrylic
           paint --

                     MARGOT
           Nobody fills the ice cube trays.

Malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. Margot is looking in
the freezer. She takes out the trays and brings them to the
sink. She runs the water.

                     MARGOT
           Sorry, what were you --

                       MALCOLM
           Nothing.    It doesn't matter.

                     MARGOT
           No, what were you saying?

                     MALCOLM
           It really... Nothing.

                        MARGOT
           Okay.

She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full
trays.
                     MALCOLM
           I was saying I'm doing these
           abstractions in acrylic paint. But
           it's not... I'm not getting paid
           or anything. I don't know, I hate
           that question, "What do you do?"
                     MARGOT
           You asked me.
                     MALCOLM
           I know, but...

                                                             59.


     Malcolm exhales in frustration.

46   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          46

     Pauline and Malcolm open the gate to the Vogler's property.

                         MALCOLM
               I think we shouldn't mention the
               tree, we should let them know that
               there will be people and music on
               Saturday and it will be louder than
               usual.

                         PAULINE
               And that they can come for a glass
               of champagne. But you tell them.
               I think they respond to you better.

     They approach the Vogler's sun-worn and paint chipped house.

                         MALCOLM
               Well, I am ultimately one of them.
               You shouldn't've made me shave the
               stache.

                         PAULINE
                   (laughs)
               Yeah, right.

                         MALCOLM
               Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I
               was ever gay. Do you know what
               that's about?

                          PAULINE
               No.

     Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over
     his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.
                          PAULINE
               Hi.
     Vogler stops.   His face is jagged and worn.
                          PAULINE
               Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm.
               We've met before. We're your
               neighbors.
     The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.

                                                           60.


                    VOGLER
          You gonna cut that tree down?

                    PAULINE
          Well, we grew up with that tree and
          we're getting married under it
          Saturday and --

She waits for Malcolm to jump in.    He doesn't.   Vogler says
softly, but sternly:

                    VOGLER
          The roots are growing into our
          property. It's rotting, it's
          killing our plants.

                    PAULINE
          We had a tree doctor out and he
          said it was healthy.

Pauline smacks Malcolm's arm.

                    PAULINE
          Would it hurt you to say anything?

                     MALCOLM
          What?   What do you want from me?

                    PAULINE
          You're making me do the whole
          fucking thing.

                    MALCOLM
          You brought up the tree.

                    PAULINE
          He brought up --

She stops herself.   She says to Vogler:
                    PAULINE
          I'm sorry... This was better
          thought-through back at the house.
Pauline's gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot
described earlier. He runs his hand through his hair as if
something might be caught in there.
                    PAULINE
          We were wondering if you and your
          wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name
          -- would like to come over for...

                                                           61.


                    VOGLER
          You should ask her. She makes the
          plans. I'm going to go in now.

He tramps inside.   The screen door bangs.

                    MALCOLM
          I felt like you didn't give me a
          chance to say what I wanted to say.

Pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away.
Malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.

                    MALCOLM
          I want to punch that guy in the
          nose!

                    PAULINE
          You've never hit anyone.

                    MALCOLM
          I have too!

                     PAULINE
          Who?

                    MALCOLM
          Lots of -- You don't know them.
          They're not around because I've
          punched them.

A smile breaks across Pauline's face.   Malcolm seethes.

                    MALCOLM
          Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not
          funny. I'll fucking punch your
          sister.

Malcolm clenches his fists.    He points at Vogler's place.
                    MALCOLM
          The threat is not out there. It's
          in our house. It's sleeping in my
          studio. I mean, I wouldn't
          actually hit her, but I feel...I
          feel like doing it. She's such a
          fucking idiot.
                    PAULINE
          She's not an idiot.    You might not
          like her --

                                                            62.


                    MALCOLM
          She is. She is an idiot!    You're
          an idiot.

                    PAULINE
          Jesus.

                    MALCOLM
          You're both fucking morons. I'm so
          fucking... I'm trying so hard.
          You don't give me any credit.

                    PAULINE
          What is wrong?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't know, I have the emotional
          version of whatever bad feng shui
          would be. I don't know. You tell
          me, you understand this shit.

                    PAULINE
          Did you drink your teas?

                    MALCOLM
          Yeah, I drank my fucking teas!
          Don't judge me now. Really, I
          think when you look back at this
          you're going to see I'm not acting
          like a crazy person. That this is
          the right reaction. In proportion
          with what is going on. This is
          right!

Malcolm looks around furiously. The only thing available to
him is a leafy stalk. He pulls on it, but it won't uproot.
He tears the leaves off in a rage.

                    PAULINE
          You have the most oddly self-
          conscious form of rage I've ever --

                    MALCOLM
          I hate you.
Exhausted he approaches her.   He says, still with anger:
                    MALCOLM
          Let's make love.

                                                             63.


47   CUT TO:                                                     47

     Pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. She
     looks up suddenly and stops: A man watches her from the lawn.
     He holds a bouquet of flowers. Pauline runs to him.

                           PAULINE
               Jim...

     They embrace.    Her hand cups the back of his neck.

                           CLAUDE (O.S.)
               Dad!

     Claude runs from the house.

48   EXT. PATIO - LATE DAY                                       48

     Pauline, Malcolm, Margot, Jim, Claude and Ingrid eat fish
     stew and peasant bread. Jim's flowers sit in a vase. He
     wears a tan knit bracelet that Ingrid made.

                         JIM
               It was a difficult    decision because
               Claude has so many    friends at
               school now, but it    is expensive and
               Bronx Science is a    great public
               school.

                         CLAUDE
               I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

                         MARGOT
               He's not a good test taker.

                         MALCOLM
               I went to Stuy.

                         MARGOT
                   (caught off-guard)
               Really?

                           MALCOLM
               Really.
                         CLAUDE
               I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's
               so expensive.

     Malcolm lifts up a bottle of Jameson from the floor near his
     chair and pours himself another stiff drink.

                                                64.


                    JIM
          Josh is a great test taker, but
          Claude thinks more abstractly.
          He's more creative. Right?

                    CLAUDE
          I guess so.

Jim smiles warmly at his son.

                    JIM
          I saw the one armed man who really
          has two arms at the bodega.

                    CLAUDE
          Did you give him confusing change?

                   JIM
          I did. I tripped him up with some
          nickels. And a Canadian quarter.

                    MALCOLM
          You know what I tried the other
          day? Sitting down to pee. Have
          you done this, Jim?

                     JIM
          No...no.

                    MALCOLM
          I did it as a lark. As a joke
          really. I was going to call
          Pauline in and say, guess what I'm
          doing here...

                    PAULINE
          I'm sorry I didn't get to have that
          experience.

                    MALCOLM
          I was thinking, you know, my dad
          used to say, "Why stand when you
          can sit." And this is a really
          good example of that. I mean, it
          took me so long to try because I
          was embarrassed.
              (to the sisters)
          You guys do it all the time.
                    MARGOT
          I never sit down in a public place.
          I squat and hover.

                                                           65.


Ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.

                     MALCOLM
          Anyway, I recommend it.     At least
          to try it.

                    PAULINE
          Jim, I'm sorry about the room.
          It's usually Malcolm's storage room
          so it's kind of make-shift right
          now.

                       JIM
          It's fine.

Margot stares at Jim.

                    JIM
          Margot, open your gift.

An unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside Margot's
plate.

                    MARGOT
          I get self-conscious opening
          presents in front of people.    This
          weekend is about Pauline.

                       PAULINE
          Oh...poo.     Open it Margot.

Margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the
tape. Pauline groans:

                    PAULINE
          Come on, get to it.

Margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.

                    MALCOLM
          Those look warm.
                    JIM
          I remember last year in Vermont you
          said your feet were freezing.
Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She
leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and
briskly on the lips.

                       MARGOT
          Thank you.

                                                             66.


49   INT. JIM'S CAR - NIGHT                                      49

     Jim drives with Margot in the passenger seat.

                         MARGOT
               I already have slippers.

                         JIM
               Well, that's okay.   Two sets are
               fine, right?

                         MARGOT
               It makes me sad to get a present
               that I already have.

                         JIM
               Why?

                         MARGOT
               It makes me feel like you don't
               know me.

     She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.

                         JIM
               What's wrong with your ear?

                         MARGOT
               I asked you not to come. I was so
               clear and you did it anyway so
               blithely.

                         JIM
               We need time alone to sort this
               out. You can't just run away --

                         MARGOT
               Okay, so we're here.   I'm giving
               you this time.
                         JIM
                   (trying a joke)
               Well, now you're putting too much
               pressure on me.
     Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back.   He takes
     a moment, preparing to speak. Then:
                         JIM
               What is that?
     His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They
     pass.

                                                                67.


                         MARGOT
               Keep driving.

     Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder.

                         MARGOT
               No...no...no. Jim, no.

                         JIM
               Let me just...

     Jim gets out of the car.     A sobbing woman crouches, cradling
     a bloody dog.

                         WOMAN
               Please help me.

     Jim comes toward her.

                         WOMAN
               Please help me. He got hit by a
               car. Please help me.

     Margot opens her door and steps out.

                         MARGOT
                   (warily)
               Jim...

     Jim kneels down by the whining pit bull.    The woman screams:

                          WOMAN
               Help me!

                         MARGOT
               Careful, he might bite you!

     Jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal.

50   INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT                                      50
     Jim drives, his front covered in blood. Margot is shot-gun.
     The lady rides in back with the panting pit in her lap.
                         WOMAN
               Hurry...he's dying.     He's dying.
     Margot puts her hands over her ears.    Jim speeds up.
                         WOMAN
               He didn't do anything. Roger is an
               innocent. He's an innocent
               creature.

                                                                68.


                          MARGOT
               Oh, God.

                          JIM
               Margot.

                         MARGOT
                   (whispering)
               I can't stand her.

51   EXT. VETERINARY HOSPITAL - NIGHT                             51

     Jim comes outside tucking his wallet in his back pocket.
     Margot sits on the car hood smoking a joint.

                         MARGOT
               You paid, didn't you?

                         JIM
               She didn't have her purse with her.
               It wasn't so expensive. Roger's
               going to live.

                         MARGOT
               I don't give a fuck about Roger.
               And...that makes me feel like shit.
               You make me feel like shit. I
               wouldn't have stopped.

                         JIM
               Of course you would've.

                         MARGOT
               No, I wouldn't've. I would have
               kept driving. I hate myself when
               I'm with you.

                         JIM
                   (frustrated)
               Margot, I'm not... I can't talk to
               you when you're this fucked up.

                         MARGOT
               You're just like Claude in that
               way...you make me feel guilty.
               Sometimes I find you so despicable.
     Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly
     removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders. He
     fishes into his pants pocket for his keys. Tears start down
     Margot's cheeks.

                                                                69.


                         JIM
               What's wrong?

                         MARGOT
               I don't know.
                   (pause)
               Before you gave me your sweater I
               think I didn't realize I was cold.

     Margot leans in to him, her forehead presses against his
     cheek. After a moment, he puts his arms around her.

                         MARGOT
                   (quietly)
               Take me home and go away.

52   INT./EXT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                52

     Margot smokes by the open door. She drinks a glass of white
     wine. Pauline eats from a left-over Chinese container.

                         MARGOT
               If it were someone else I'd
               understand it, I'd feel sympathy
               even. But since it's me, I just
               feel bad. And horribly critical.
               I haven't been able to tell Claude
               what's happening. And I have to.
               I'm going to.
                   (frustrated)
               How can I be all these people? How
               can I be married to Jim. And fuck
               Dick. And want them both and then
               neither of them...

                         PAULINE
               I know. We're at the age where
               we're becoming invisible to men and
               if a guy wants to fuck us, it's
               very tempting.
                         MARGOT
               What are you saying?
                         PAULINE
               I'm saying, if you get your sense
               of self from being fuckable and
               that starts to wane -- it's very
               hard. I almost had an affair too.
               But you know, you don't have to do
               it. You can, I don't know, get a
               manicure or something.

                                                        70.


Margot grows furious.   She turns to hide her face.

                    PAULINE
          You know I tell people you're my
          closest friend. I really miss you.

                    MARGOT
              (barely)
          Me too.

                    PAULINE
          But I can't help feeling that you
          really came to my wedding because I
          live a mile away from the guy
          you're fucking.

                    MARGOT
          Come on, Pauline. You make it
          sound like I'm using you.

                    PAULINE
          Yeah.

There is a long silence between them. Finally, Pauline
indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril.

                    PAULINE
          You have a...

Margot clears her nose quickly with her finger.

                    MARGOT
          Did I get it?

                    PAULINE
          Yeah, I think so.

                    MARGOT
              (suddenly)
          Paul, what are you doing getting
          married to this guy? He's not good
          enough for you. He's so coarse,
          he's like guys we rejected when we
          were sixteen. You know...don't
          make a mistake like this.
              (pause)
          I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to
          say that, but you know I'm truthful
          so... Would you rather I lie?

                    PAULINE
          Who should I be with then?

                                                               71.


     A smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures
     turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground.
     Garbage is strewn across the driveway.

                         MARGOT (O.S.)
               Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up.
               I will call the police. This is
               our property. Pick that up.

     Pauline remains seated at the table, stunned.    Margot comes
     back inside.

                            MARGOT
               Creeps.

53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING                                     53

     Malcolm crams the trash back in the cans. He sees something
     amidst the milk cartons and corn husks. He reaches down and
     lifts up a severed pig's hoof.

54   EXT. FIELD - MORNING                                        54

     Claude and Ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to Wizard.

                         CLAUDE
               Dogs usually come back, I think.

                         INGRID
               What happened to your dad?

                         CLAUDE
               He went to Vermont.

                         INGRID
               He didn't want to come to the
               wedding?

                         CLAUDE
               I don't think he could...    I think
               he couldn't.
                   (pause)
               You want to see me dance?
                            INGRID
               Okay.
     Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a
     rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye.
                         INGRID
                   (under her breath)
               Wizard...

                                                         72.


The animal is gone.

A figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the
Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks.
Ingrid's attention goes to him.

                    CLAUDE
          You're not watching.

The boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its
tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few
feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back
as it lands at their feet.

                    BOY
          Where are you going?

                    CLAUDE
              (stopping)
          We have to get home.

                    BOY
          Is that your girlfriend?

                    CLAUDE
          No, she's my cousin.

                    BOY
          You a fruity?

                      CLAUDE
          Um...no.

                    BOY
              (to Ingrid)
          You a fruity?

                      INGRID
                (with certainty)
          No.
                    BOY
          We will hurt you.
Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away.
                    INGRID
          He's a Vogler.

                    CLAUDE
          He's just a stupid boy.

                                                                73.


     Claude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows.
     Claude's gait quickens.

                         INGRID
               Hold it, I have a rock in my
               sandal.

                         CLAUDE
               Come on, Ingrid.

     Ingrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is
     behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over.

                            INGRID
               Oww!

     Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude.
     They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass.

                         CLAUDE
               Get him off me. Ingrid!

     Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house.

     Claude wrestles with the boy. The boy growls. He grabs hold
     of Claude's arms and sinks his teeth into Claude's shoulder.

                            CLAUDE
               Ayy!     Help me!

     Claude kicks and yanks himself free.     He runs wildly.

     Close on Claude.    Tears stream down.   He coughs and spits.

55   INT. HOUSE - SAME                                               55

     Claude bursts through the front door. Ingrid sees Claude and
     runs to the kitchen. Margot, in a suit, goes over notes.

                         MARGOT
               Woa, don't run so fast.
                         CLAUDE
               There's a boy! He bit me!
                         MARGOT
                   (alarmed)
               Who bit you?
                           CLAUDE
               A boy.    A Vogler!   Where's Ingrid?

                                                                74.


                         MARGOT
               Let me see.

     He tilts his head, she leans down and looks at his neck.
     There are red and purple bite marks.

                         MARGOT
                   (rising)
               I'm calling the police.

     Claude grabs her arm.

                         CLAUDE
               No, don't! It'll get worse. Why
               did you say anything to them?

                         MARGOT
               Claude, this isn't my fault.

                         CLAUDE
               That boy bit me because you
               couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.

                         MARGOT
               Claude, you're being a jerk.

                          CLAUDE
               You shit in your shoes and then you
               fuck them!

     Margot smacks Claude in the face.   Ingrid stares wide eyed.

56   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                         56

     A placard reads: A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick
     Koosman. People mull about with drinks. Pauline and Claude
     admire the display of Margot's books.

                         PAULINE
               You really want to know? I'll tell
               you. She wrote a story about Lenny
               and me.
                   (flips through pages)
               Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were
               talking almost every day at this
               point and there was no warning.
               Maybe a couple of remarks that
               she'd used some things of ours...
               Then The New Yorker comes -- we
               have a subscription -- and there's
               the story and... It's things we
               said and did -- stuff I told her in
               confidence.
                         (MORE)

                                                                75.

                         PAULINE (CONT'D)
               I think it helped end our marriage.
               I read it and thought, "She hates
               me."

                         CLAUDE
               She doesn't hate you.

     Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister.

                         PAULINE
               You think? Margot tried to murder
               me when we were girls. She put me
               on a baking sheet, sprinkled me
               with paprika and put me in the
               oven.

57   CUT TO:                                                      57

     The crowd files in.   Margot and Dick stand in a corner.

                         MARGOT
               Jim was here.

     Dick flips through some notes.

                         DICK
               Is Jim still writing?

                          MARGOT
                   (nods)
               I told him to go to Vermont without
               me.

                         DICK
               I'd love to see him tell a linear
               story for a change. Jim never
               wanted to make it easy for the
               reader, did he. The nicest man
               I've ever met, but he can't play
               the game.
                         MARGOT
               I'm not joining him. I'm going to
               stay here and then...we'll see.
               Right. Okay?
                         DICK
               I didn't ask you to do that.
                   (pause)
               The guy's pointing at us...

                                                               76.


58   CUT TO:                                                     58

     Margot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of
     rows of fold-out chairs. Only a few empty seats remain.
     Pauline and Claude sit in the back.

                         DICK
               I'm very interested in your story
               "Middle Children."

     Some people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets
     started.

                         DICK
               The father is a loathsome character
               yet we also feel a strange sympathy
               for him.

                         MARGOT
               Yeah, well I was very interested in
               exploring a father-daughter
               relationship. While he clings
               desperately to her, suffocates her
               really, he also silently resents
               the responsibility of parenthood.

                         DICK
               There's this sexualized push-pull
               with Daphne which I find --

                         MARGOT
               He craves isolation really. I
               always thought of him as someone
               who so over identifies with
               everyone around him that he begins
               to lose all sense of himself.

                         DICK
               You make his only recourse to
               abandon his family, including his
               beloved daughter.

                         MARGOT
               Right, that's true.   That's true.
                         DICK
               I write historical fiction so I
               don't have to answer to this, but I
               wonder for someone who writes so
               nakedly about family, how
               autobiographical is this portrait?

     Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.

                                                           77.


                    MARGOT
          My father was a loving person. He
          had his days, of course, but...he
          was devoted to us as children. I
          wouldn't have written this portrait
          were it true.

Pauline nods slightly.

                    DICK
          But I'm interested in how the
          father could be in fact a portrait
          of you.
Margot stares, dumbstruck.

                    MARGOT
          Umm...I don't... Why do you assume
          it's based on... We all take from
          life. I had to have our
          refrigerator repaired the other day
          at our apartment in Manhattan. I
          was alone with a guy, I think he
          was Puerto Rican, sent over
          by...Whirlpool, I think it is who
          made our fridge. Although he said
          he worked for an independent
          organization who Whirlpool
          subcontracts. I think he was
          retarded. There was an anger in
          him and suddenly I became afraid
          for my life. I called Jim at NYU.
          I asked him to come home.

Margot stops.   Her face is awash in sweat.

Pauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest.    His
eyes widen, fixed on his mother.

                    MARGOT
          It might be Frigidaire... I'm
          sorry... I don't... I'm not sure
          what I'm... I think I need to take
          a moment...

She stands and walks off the stage. She realizes she still
has the mike. She goes back and places it on her seat.
                    MARGOT
              (almost incoherently)
          You're an asshole...

                                                             78.


59   INT. BOOKSTORE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER                      59

     Margot grabs a pill from her pocket, puts it on her tongue
     and drinks from the faucet. There is a knocking. Margot
     opens the door. Claude looks up at her. Pauline and Dick
     wait in the background.

                         MARGOT
               I need to be alone right now, okay?

                         CLAUDE
               What's wrong?

                         MARGOT
               I don't know. I'll tell you
               sometime. Go on.

                         CLAUDE
               Are you sure?

                        MARGOT
               Yes. Go with mom.    I'll see you
               later.

                         CLAUDE
               You said, mom.

                         MARGOT
                   (snapping)
               But you know what I mean. Go with
               Pauline. Jesus, do I...do I need
               to spell it out for you?
                   (she points)
               Go. With. Her.

60   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            60

     A simple, spare space, empty except for Pauline and Claude.

                         PAULINE
               Are you okay?
                           CLAUDE
               I'm okay.
                          PAULINE
               You're your mom's favorite.     Do you
               know that?
                         CLAUDE
               I don't think she has a favorite.

                                                       79.


                    PAULINE
          She's always liked you best.   More
          than Jim even.

                     CLAUDE
          But they're married.   It's
          different.

                    PAULINE
          But she still loves you best. It's
          hard, I think, to find people in
          the world you love more than your
          family.

                    CLAUDE
          I like Malcolm.

                     PAULINE
          Yeah? Good. I don't know. I do
          too.
               (pause)
          I can teach you to swim if you
          like.

                    CLAUDE
          No, thanks.

Claude looks at the floor. His sneaker rests next to her
open toed sandals. She taps his foot with hers.

                    PAULINE
          Has your mother talked to you yet?

                    CLAUDE
          I don't think so.   About what?

                    PAULINE
          Are you okay? It's hard to see
          your mom like that -- get attacked
          like that. Right? It was mean
          what he did. I think it was really
          shitty.
                    CLAUDE
          Mm hm.
                    PAULINE
          You know, I think your mom's going
          through a rough time right now
          and...whatever she tells you...like
          if she says she's leaving your
          father...remember that she often
          changes her mind and...
                    (MORE)

                                                             80.

                         PAULINE (CONT'D)
               I don't want you to worry about
               anything right now.

     Claude says nothing.

61   EXT. HOUSE - LATE DAY                                     61

     Pauline's Volvo rolls into the drive. She and Claude get out
     of the front seats. Margot climbs out of the back holding a
     big cake box. No one speaks.

     Malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a
     chainsaw toward the oak tree. Ingrid runs to her mom.

                         INGRID
               He's cutting it down.

                            PAULINE
               Good.

     Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio.

                         MAISY
               My dad's late to pick me up.    I
               hope I'm not a pain.

                         PAULINE
               You're not a pain.

     Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with
     ice. The tent is up. The tables and chairs are placed
     around the lawn. She watches Malcolm prepare to take the
     tree down. She puts her pinky in her ear and twists. Claude
     approaches.

                         MARGOT
               I told Paul I didn't want you guys
               to come.

                         CLAUDE
               I thought it was interesting.
                         MARGOT
               What did Paul say?
                         CLAUDE
               I think she liked it.
                         MARGOT
               Yeah, right. Did you talk about me
               afterwards?
                            CLAUDE
               No.

                                                           81.


                    MARGOT
          I can tell you're lying.

                    CLAUDE
          We didn't, mom.

                    MARGOT
          I don't trust her.

                    CLAUDE
          She really loves you.   She does.

Margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.

                    MARGOT
          Pauline told me she's very
          disappointed in you.

                    CLAUDE
          Why?

                    MARGOT
          She thinks you laze about the
          house. Ingrid is always offering
          to help clean or cook. She made
          bracelets for all the guests. Even
          Malcolm puts up the tent. You just
          wait until everyone else does it
          for you.

                    CLAUDE
          That's not true.

                    MARGOT
          It is true. You're never helpful.
          I wish I had taught you better
          manners.

                    CLAUDE
          I can try to make popovers.   If I
          can remember how.

                    MARGOT
          Don't bother.
She looks at him with grave disappointment.
                    CLAUDE
          Why are you looking at me like
          that?

                                                                82.


                         MARGOT
               I just see how much you've changed.
               Your body language. You used to be
               rounder and more graceful. You're
               so stiff now. So blase.

                         CLAUDE
               What do you mean?

                         MARGOT
                   (retreating)
               I can't explain it.

     Margot shakes her head.   She's suddenly distraught.

                         MARGOT
               It's okay though.

                         CLAUDE
               Uh huh.

     Claude looks devastated. He starts toward the beach.
     Margot's eyes well up -- she says, trying to make things
     better:

                         MARGOT
               You're still handsome.

62   EXT. HOUSE - SAME                                             62

     Pauline marches toward Malcolm.    Malcolm wears the safety
     goggles and revs the chainsaw.

                         PAULINE
               Are you able to do this yourself?

                         MALCOLM
               Pauline, do you want me to cut it
               down or not?
                         PAULINE
               Watch the tent.
     The jagged blades pierce the trunk.   Pauline crunches her
     face. Malcolm stops suddenly.
     He walks around the tree and inspects the bark.
                         MALCOLM
                   (indicating his fleece)
               I liked how it looked on Vogler.
     Pauline starts to say something -- stops.    Then:

                                                         83.


                    PAULINE
          I think it's over between Dick and
          Margot. He was so cruel to her
          today. And poor Claude had to
          watch it all. She should just get
          out of the marriage and then she
          can fuck whoever she wants, you
          know. It's cowardly. And Dick
          Koosman. What a choice. I
          mean...you know?

                    MALCOLM
          I agree. I hate the idea of Dick
          fucking Margot.

                    PAULINE
          What does that mean?   You want to
          fuck Margot?

                    MALCOLM
          Pauline, that's not what I said.

                    PAULINE
          I know you have a crush on her, you
          already told me that.

Malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again.   They yell
over the noise:

                    MALCOLM
          I didn't say that. I said I
          thought she was attractive after
          you grilled me. She has no
          interest in me anyway. Not that it
          would matter if she did.

                    PAULINE
          Have you ever done anything like
          that.
                    MALCOLM
          What do you mean?
                    PAULINE
          Have you ever cheated on me?
                    MALCOLM
          No!
Malcolm shuts the motor.
                    MALCOLM
          Can I do this?

                                      84.


          PAULINE
Those emails you had with that
student of mine.

          MALCOLM
    (exhales)
Uh huh.

          PAULINE
Did that...I know you said it was
nothing.

             MALCOLM
It was.

             PAULINE
I just...     Can you say it again?

          MALCOLM
I just did. Now, can I cut down
the tree?

          PAULINE
You never did anything with her?

          MALCOLM
No. She emailed me after we met at
that reading at the college and...
You know we were friends.

          PAULINE
Right, just a regular friendship
between you and a twenty year old
girl.

           MALCOLM
Pauline, how many times do I have
to say it.

          PAULINE
But...why don't I believe it?
          MALCOLM
Because Margot can't understand why
you're with me and now when she's
around you look for things.
          PAULINE
    (hesitates)
You promise.
             MALCOLM
I promise.

                                                         85.


Pauline looks at him long and hard.   Malcolm takes off his
goggles.

                      PAULINE
          Okay.    I'm sorry.

                       MALCOLM
          It's okay.

Malcolm and Pauline continue to stare at one another. He
guns the chainsaw. Tears spill suddenly from his eyes.
Pauline startles. He flicks the switch off.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm going to tell you something.

                    PAULINE
              (suddenly terrified)
          What?

                    MALCOLM
          I don't want to lose you, though.
          Okay?

Pauline's face goes pale.

                    MALCOLM
          I'm going to tell you...    Just let
          me... Maisy...

Pauline teeters.

                    PAULINE
          I don't want to know.

                    MALCOLM
          ...we didn't really do anything.
          We were goofing around, I was
          making fun of her cause she dates a
          jock...
                    PAULINE
          I don't want to know.
                    MALCOLM
          I shouldn't've put myself in that
          position, I know that. We brushed
          lips really. It was barely a kiss.
          And then we stopped. That was it.
His nose runs.    He wipes it messily with his arm.

                                                                86.


                         MALCOLM
               Our tongues touched. I don't want
               to under-sell it either. I mean...
               We made out. I made out with her.
               I don't know why. I don't even
               like her. It's been a heady time.
                   (Pauline says nothing)
               What are you thinking? Please,
               tell me what you're thinking.

     Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the
     trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. It
     doesn't budge. In frustration and rage, she runs.

63   CUT TO:                                                      63

     Ingrid is the only one on the patio as Pauline approaches.

                         INGRID
               Has anyone seen Wizard?

                          PAULINE
               No.   Where's Maisy?

                         INGRID
               Upstairs, I think with Claude.

64   INT. PAULINE'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY - DAY                         64

     Pauline enters in a daze.   A toilet flushes.    Maisy comes out
     of Pauline's bathroom.

                         MAISY
               Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I
               hope that's okay I used yours.

     Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove
     grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.

                         MAISY
               I love your wedding dress.   It's so
               unconventional and great.
     Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and
     Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at
     the pictures too.
     Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows.
     Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right
     behind her.
                         MAISY
               Is everything okay?

                                                              87.


                         PAULINE
                   (pause)
               Nothing.

     Maisy stops at the landing. Claude sits at the bottom of the
     staircase playing with a string.

                         MAISY
               Claude, do you want to play
               croquet?

                          CLAUDE
               Okay.

     Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisy's lower
     back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy
     turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like
     she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.

     Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg.
     Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.

65   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                             65

     The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree.
     Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet
     away.

     In the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the
     driveway. Maisy hurries toward him.

     Ingrid says, buried in the noise:

                         INGRID
               There's Dick.

     Malcolm sees Dick.   He pushes the blade harder into the wood.

                         INGRID
               Is it almost ready?
                         MALCOLM
                   (distracted)
               Almost.
     Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He
     immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear
     creeps up his neck.

     Dick speeds up.
     Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts
     toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused.

                                                           88.


Dick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long
wooden stairs to the beach.

Malcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath.
Sweat pours down his face and body.

Dick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow.
His jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a
time.

Malcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can
sideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet
sinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward.

He looks up -- Dick lunges.

Dick pounds Malcolm's head and face.     Malcolm throws his arms
up and tries to block the punches.

                    MALCOLM
          I didn't do anything!    I didn't do
          anything!

                    DICK
          Fucking sleazebag!

Dick gets up.   He kicks Malcolm hard.

                    DICK
          I don't ever want to see you again.

Malcolm balls himself up against a rock.    He cries:

                    MALCOLM
          Fuck off, dickhead.

Dick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard.

                     MALCOLM
          Ow!
Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away.    Malcolm
screams:
                    MALCOLM
          Fucking dickbag! She's lying!
He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
                    MALCOLM
              (choking on tears)
          Oh, man.

                                                               89.


     There's a rustling noise in the wind. Malcolm looks -- a mud-
     and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile.

66   CUT TO:                                                     66

     Wheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with
     Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from
     the porch.

67   INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - SAME                         67

     Pauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers,
     silverware, napkins, dishes. Margot enters. Claude follows.

                         MARGOT
               Come with me to New York.

                         PAULINE
               I can't talk about it --

                         MARGOT
               Okay, but you can't marry him. You
               have to go now. We can think about
               what to do with the baby --

                         PAULINE
                   (stands)
               Margot, I can't --

                         MARGOT
               Don't turn vague, listen to me --

                         PAULINE
               I want you to pack all your things
               and get out of here. You can take
               our car and leave it at the ferry.

                         MARGOT
                   (startled)
               What?
                         CLAUDE
               I'll help out more.   I can make
               popovers.
     Pauline looks at Claude strangely.    She leans down and kisses
     him on the lips.
                         PAULINE
               Do you love me?
                   (Claude nods)
               Good.

                                                        90.


                     MARGOT
          Don't take this out on me?   I'm on
          your side.

                    PAULINE
          No, you're not. You're not.

                    MARGOT
          I've kept my mouth shut because --

                    PAULINE
          No, you haven't kept your mouth
          shut! No you haven't...kept your
          mouth shut...

                    MARGOT
          Okay, I told you and I was right.
          He's done an insane thing. You
          don't know this man. What he did
          is criminal.

                    PAULINE
          Margot, I can't...

                    MARGOT
          It's pedophilia.

                     PAULINE
          Get out!

Pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the
table. The plates shatter. Silence save for their
breathing.

                    PAULINE
          Becky and I talk about you -- about
          what a monster you are. Is it
          cause Mom gave me the house? Can't
          I have anything? What was I
          thinking? I let you in. Get!
          Out!

                    MARGOT
          What? What are you saying? I
          don't recognize you -- it's like
          you're channelling someone.
                    PAULINE
              (suddenly)
          Ingrid!

                                                              91.


68   EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS                                      68

     The purple of Ingrid's batik shirt shines in the grass
     beneath the tree.

     The trunk -- a gash at its base -- teeters.

     Pauline takes off into the field.

     Ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air
     with her finger.

     Pauline sprints --

                            PAULINE
               Ingrid!

     Ingrid says to no one in particular:

                            INGRID
               What?

     Pauline's breaths are rapid, jagged.

     Ingrid stands.

     A wind whips up.    The tree sways.

     Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself
     away from the tree.

                            INGRID
               Ow!

     Ingrid sobs as they run. Pauline looks back. The tree is
     still standing. They embrace a few feet out of its range.

                         INGRID
               It wasn't going to fall!
                            PAULINE
               I'm sorry.
     Malcolm trudges up the stairs.   He's bloody and tattered.
     Wizard trots behind him.
                            INGRID
               Wizard!
     She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar.   The three of
     them stand a few feet apart.
     There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --

                                                             92.


     -- crack --

     Malcolm pulls both girls toward him --

     The tree topples -- the thick trunk rips through the wedding
     tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence --

     -- onto the Vogler's property.

69   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                            69

     The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the
     steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit
     stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming
     lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.

                         CLAUDE
               I thought you couldn't drive.

                         MARGOT
                   (irritated)
               I can drive. Why does everyone say
               that? I used to drive.

     They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them.
     The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:

                         PAULINE
               We have to call people and cancel.

                         INGRID
               What happened? Can I still sing?

     Margot rolls down the window.

                         MARGOT
                   (to Claude)
               You do smell.

                          CLAUDE
               Well, I'm not wearing any
               deodorant.
     They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend.
     The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the
     brake.
                         MARGOT
               Shit.

                         CLAUDE
               What?

                                                             93.


                         MARGOT
               I don't think...
                   (she pumps again)
               No... We don't have brakes.

                         PAULINE
                   (resigned)
               The brakes are bad, that's right.

                         CLAUDE
               What does that mean?

                         MARGOT
               What do you think it means?

                         CLAUDE
               I mean, what can we do?

     The car coasts faster down the hill.

                         CLAUDE
               Mom.

     Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front.

     Pauline wraps her body around her daughter.

     Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn
     into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck.
     The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of
     a tree.

70   CUT TO:                                                   70

     Margot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony
     white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down.
     They're all covered in sweat and there's dirt caked on their
     feet and ankles.

                         MARGOT
               I ruined these shoes.
     Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain.   She races
     behind a tree. Margot follows.
                         INGRID
               Mom, are you okay?
                         PAULINE (O.S.)
               Don't look!

     Margot stops.

                                                              94.


                          PAULINE (O.S.)
               Shit!

                         INGRID
               Mom, what happened?

                          PAULINE (O.S.)
               Nothing.

     Margot steps to see around the trunk. The kids follow
     behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt.
     She tosses them in the brush.

                          PAULINE
               Fuck.
     Margot turns to the kids.   Ingrid hides a smile.

                         CLAUDE
               Did she poop in her pants?

                         MARGOT
               It happens to everyone. Not just
               babies. It'll happen to you too
               someday.

71   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                            71

     Margot and Claude sit, streaked with mud and perspiration.
     Margot drinks a beer, Claude a Coke. Margot pops a blue pill
     in her mouth and swallows. Ingrid swings on the rail.

     Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her
     sister. She takes the beer and swigs.

                         PAULINE
               I left mom and Becky a message.

                         MARGOT
               I don't think mom knows how to work
               the machine.
     Margot puts her pinky in her ear.

                         MARGOT
               I can hear it flapping.
                         PAULINE
               You should take care of that.   It
               can hatch eggs.

                                                              95.


     Claude turns his head. In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs.
     Vogler and the Vogler boy. She sings along to the radio.
     She runs her hand through her son's hair gently. He nestles
     into her shoulder.

72   EXT. SEASIDE TOWN STREET - EVENING                         72

     The four of them get out of a taxi.   A small, peeling hotel.

73   INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               73

     A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall
     carpet. Pauline combs Ingrid's hair on one of the two double
     beds. Ingrid practices her wedding song. Claude sits on the
     other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: Margot
     stands with her back to him. She talks on her cell phone in
     a whisper. She hangs up. Claude walks inside. The sink
     drips.

                         MARGOT
               Sweety, there's a bus that leaves
               to Vermont from town tomorrow
               morning. I just talked to your dad
               and he's going to pick you up.

                         CLAUDE
               Aren't you coming?

                          MARGOT
               No.

                          CLAUDE
               Why not?

                         MARGOT
               I have to help out Paul and Ingrid.

     Claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet.

                         CLAUDE
               I don't want to go tomorrow.
     The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting.
     Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are
     already looking out.
     Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people
     hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the
     rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed
     in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard
     coffins.

                                                       96.


                    PAULINE
          There's Malcolm.

Pauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see
it isn't him. Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of
tears.

                    PAULINE
          I can't live in that house alone.

                    MARGOT
          You're going to be fine.

                    PAULINE
          Maybe...maybe I could get a place
          in Brooklyn -- Williamsburg or
          something. People are living there
          right?

                    MARGOT
          You don't want to live there.   It's
          all young people.

                    PAULINE
          But what do you think of that idea?

                    MARGOT
          Maybe. Let's see. You know if you
          don't want to come with me, I'm
          sure mom will let you stay with her
          --

                    PAULINE
              (through tears)
          You're already trying to pass me
          off on mom...

                    MARGOT
          Don't say that. Come on, you'll
          come home with us.
                    PAULINE
          You don't even know where you're
          going to live. You might have to
          move in with mom too.
Margot tightens.
                    PAULINE
          What? Oh.
              (mouthing a whisper)
          Didn't you tell him?

                                                              97.


     Margot looks at her son who continues to watch out the
     window.

     Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long
     nightshirt that reads: I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall.
     She enters the bathroom. She mutters to herself.

                         PAULINE
               What have I done? What have I
               done?

     Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few
     stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of
     signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She
     puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She
     watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.

                         CLAUDE
               What?

                         MARGOT
               Nothing. Just then I felt so much
               love for you.

75   CUT TO:                                                    75

     Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits
     on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline
     marches around and across to the other side of the room. She
     snatches the book out of Margot's hands.

                         MARGOT
               Hey!

                         PAULINE
               You cannot write about this.   You
               can't have it.
                         MARGOT
               I wasn't writing about you.
                         PAULINE
               You already took a part of my life,
               you can't have any more. And that
               goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and
               Wizard. We all own our own rights.
               They're not for sale.
                         MARGOT
               Give it back.

                                                          98.


Pauline glances at the book.

                    PAULINE
          If I could read your handwriting
          I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I
          ever see a story that involves a
          hotel room or any of this shit, I
          will fucking take your bowels out.

Pauline thrusts the book back at Margot --

CUT TO:

The kids sleep in one bed.    Margot and Pauline lie awake in
the other.

                    PAULINE
          You've now successfully ruined two
          of my marriages.

                    MARGOT
          You're not wearing any underwear.

                    PAULINE
          It's hot, I'm pregnant.    Move over.
          Jesus.

                    MARGOT
          You're not hot, your feet are cold.

                    PAULINE
          Stop touching me. I am so hot.
          Feel my head.

Margot puts her lips to Pauline's forehead.

                    MARGOT
          You have a fever.

                    PAULINE
          I don't have a fever... I'm
          pregnant...are you always like
          this?
                    MARGOT
          Get used to it... Mom and Becky
          share a bed -- you and I will
          probably get the other.

                    PAULINE
          You should just go to Vermont.

                                                            99.


                         MARGOT
               I was thinking -- you know if you
               want -- you and Ingrid could go to
               Vermont. Keep Claude company and
               Jim adores you.

                         PAULINE
               You don't like Malcolm because
               you're not attracted to him.

                         MARGOT
               Will you do it?

                         PAULINE
               No. I won't do that for you.

                         MARGOT
                   (pause)
               Did you two talk about me in town?
               What did you say?

                         PAULINE
                   (pause)
               I told him you often change your
               mind.

76   INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - MORNING                            76

     Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front.
     Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot
     drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids
     have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a
     plastic red basket lie between them.

     A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The
     music begins. The man sways and sings "On and On" by Stephen
     Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes
     moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the
     wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:
                         MARGOT
               I'm sorry, sweety. There's
               something wrong with me.
                         PAULINE
               I'm going to call him.
     Margot quickly turns to her sister.
                          MARGOT
               No.   Don't. I'm telling you.

                                                            100.


                         PAULINE
               I...I need some clothes and things.

                         MARGOT
               He should get the hell out of our
               house.

                         PAULINE
               Okay. I'll tell him to get the
               hell out of our house.

     Pauline walks over to a pay phone.

77   CUT TO:                                                      77

     Pauline holds the receiver to her ear. She stares at a
     drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the
     pay phone. Malcolm is crying.

                         MALCOLM'S VOICE
               The tent looks so lonely.

                         PAULINE
               It has no one to get married in it.

78   EXT. HOUSE - INTERCUT                                        78

     Malcolm sits in the grass, the tree and wreckage behind him.

                         MALCOLM
               I know. And it's smashed. I'm
               such a fucking idiot. Please don't
               take me seriously. I mean take me
               seriously, but not the fucked up
               parts, you know. I love you so
               much. Please marry me.

                         PAULINE
               You can't do what you did again.
               Do you understand?
                            MALCOLM
               I promise.
                         PAULINE
               No matter how tempting.
     At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent-
     mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it
     onto the floor.
     Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to
     Claude.

                                                         101.


                    INGRID
          You left it in my room.

It's a piece of fingernail.   He hesitates then puts it in his
pocket.

At the phone: Pauline rests her head against the wall.
Malcolm is bawling on the other end.

                    PAULINE
          I don't know. I don't know.

Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:

                    MALCOLM
          I ate some of the cake.   I don't
          know why, but I did it.

                    PAULINE
          What was... How was it?

                    MALCOLM
          Good.

                    PAULINE
          It's not too sweet? They sometimes
          make their stuff too sweet.

                    MALCOLM
          Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't
          even notice... They fucked up the
          cake. How sad. I love our little
          baby. I miss you.

                    PAULINE
          I miss you too. Maybe we should do
          another seminar.

Malcolm says something incomprehensible.
                    PAULINE
          I can't understand you, honey.
Margot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her
sister.
                    INGRID
          There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
Margot startles and looks out the window. Across the street
is an older woman, 70's, and a large woman, mid 30's, eating
ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.

                                                                   102.


                         PAULINE
               They didn't get my message.

     Pauline now stands above them.

                          MARGOT
               I told you she can't work the
               machine --

     Ingrid's chair scrapes as she stands.      She takes her mother's
     hand. Margot remains seated.

                          PAULINE
               What?   You're not coming?

                         MARGOT
               I'm coming, I'm coming.       What did
               he say?

     Pauline and Ingrid head for the door.      Claude waits for
     Margot.

                         MARGOT
               What did he say?

     She grabs her bags and drops some bills on the table.

                         MARGOT
                   (to herself)
               Don't worry, I got it.

79   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                            79

     The sisters and children come outside.      The mother and Becky
     now idle further down the street.

                            PAULINE/INGRID
               Mom!/Nana!

     Margot takes Claude's arm and walks quickly in the opposite
     direction. Claude, confused, glances over his shoulder.
                         MARGOT
               Don't look. Keep walking.
                         CLAUDE
               Why are we --
                         MARGOT
               We have to get you to your bus.

                                                            103.


80   CUT TO:                                                   80

     A huge parking lot. A bus in the distance.   Claude tries to
     keep pace with his mother.

                         CLAUDE
               Did you do something?

                         MARGOT
               What do you mean, do something?

                         CLAUDE
               I mean, why is the wedding not
               happening? Is there something that
               you did?

                         MARGOT
               Pauline has transferred all her
               stuff onto me. I don't understand
               her anymore. Why'd she pick this
               man? It is really berserk. And
               you know, she referred to me as her
               closest friend. We never see one
               anoth --

     An unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is
     unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak:

                         MARGOT
               I mean we're not close.   Even if we
               want to be. You know?

                         CLAUDE
               But was there anything real?

                         MARGOT
               No! How many times do I have to
               say it? Jesus. You think so
               little of me.
                   (through her sobs)
               It's good you're going. You
               shouldn't be around me either. I'd
               go if I were you...
                         CLAUDE
               Will you find Pauline and Nana
               after I leave?
                         MARGOT
                   (half-serious)
               I don't know. Maybe I'll go to
               church.

                                                         104.


Margot is sweating. She wipes her brow with her sleeve. She
periodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following.

                    CLAUDE
              (growing nervous)
          Are you angry at me?

                       MARGOT
          No, honey.     I'm not mad at you.

                    CLAUDE
          I don't want to go with you mad at
          anyone.

                    MARGOT
          Everything's fine.    I'm not mad at
          anyone.

Up ahead is a tiny depot.    People climb onto a white bus.

                    CLAUDE
          Can you come with me?

                    MARGOT
          No, you know that.
              (pause)
          We should talk about the next few
          months a little bit and what's
          going to happen --

                    CLAUDE
          I don't like Vermont.

                    MARGOT
          Your dad will be very happy to see
          you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to
          hang out.

                    CLAUDE
          Please come, mom.
                    MARGOT
              (suddenly irritable)
          Claude, stop it. Okay?
She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man.
Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply.
                    MARGOT
          You used to need me to watch you
          when you played.

                                                       105.


                    CLAUDE
          What do you mean?

                    MARGOT
              (vaguely)
          When you first started to play with
          friends, you wouldn't do it unless
          I watched you. You were afraid I
          would go out the back door. I
          don't know where I would go. Our
          yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.

She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T-
shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly:

                    CLAUDE
          I masturbated last night. While
          everyone was asleep I went into the
          bathroom and did it.

                    MARGOT
          You don't have to tell me, sweety.

The bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed.

                    MARGOT
          You've got to go.

Margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's
hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses.

                    CLAUDE
          How will you get home?

                    MARGOT
          I don't know. I'll see. Maybe
          Dick can drive me to the...
              (pause)
          Jesus, I lost the word for a
          second. The train.
                    CLAUDE
          Uh huh.
He looks at her longingly.
                    MARGOT
          Come on. You always don't want to
          leave me and you always have a good
          time once you do.
              (provocatively)
          I think you like getting away from
          me.

                                                      106.


                      CLAUDE
          I do not.    I like hanging out with
          you.

She hugs him.   He clutches her.

                    CLAUDE
          The world feels strange to me right
          now.

Margot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and
releases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his
wrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face.

                      CLAUDE
          What?

                    MARGOT
          They make your face look too wide.

Claude removes them and puts them back in the bag.

                    CLAUDE
          See you soon.

                    MARGOT
          Bye, sweety.

                    CLAUDE
          Say, you'll see me "soon."

                    MARGOT
          You're acting like a baby.

She backs away --

                    CLAUDE
          Don't see Dick.

                    MARGOT
          Don't worry. I don't think he
          wants to see me anyway.
                    CLAUDE
          Please, Margot. Promise me.
                    MARGOT
              (hesitates)
          Don't call me that.

Claude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths
"Go". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated
and anxious approaches the vehicle.

                                                               107.


81   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                        81

     Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat.    He
     puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.

     Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her
     ear and shakes her head.

     The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the
     pavement. She starts walking.

     The bus hisses and lurches forward.    Claude strains to see:

     Margot looks back.

     The bus groans as it picks up speed.   Margot sprints.

                          MARGOT
               Wait!

     She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.

                          MARGOT
               Wait!   Wait!

     She pants, breathless.

     The bus brakes.

     She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits.
     Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and
     panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.

                         MARGOT
                   (almost euphoric)
               Did you see me running out there?

                          CLAUDE
               Yeah.
     Margot cranes her neck to see outside.

                         MARGOT
               Good. That was a lot of running.
               I'm out of breath.
     Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.



     CUT TO BLACK.

 Bert:

 All right, ladies and gents,

 Comical poems suitable for the occasion, extemporized and thought up before your very eyes. All right, here we go.

 Room here for everyone gather around

 The constable's "responstable." Now, how does that sound?

 Hello, Miss Lark I got one for you.

 Miss Lark likes to walk in the park with Andrew.

 Hello, Andrew.

 Ah, Mrs. Cory a story for you.

 Your daughters were shorter than you, but they grew.

 Dear Miss Persimmon--

 
 Miss Persimmon:

 Yes?

 
 Bert:

 Wind's in the east, mist comin' in.

 Like something is brewin' about to begin

 Can't put me finger on what lies in store

 But I feel what's to happen, all happened before.

 I'm sorry. Where was I? Thank you, one and all, for your kind support. Ah, Miss Lark, thank you. Crikey. Bless you, guv. Generosity itself, that's what you are. No charge.

 Oh, it's you! Hello. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, you say? All right. Come along with me. This here's Cherry Tree Lane. Nice little spot, you might say. Number 17's just down a bit. Now, this imposing edifice what first greets the eye, is the home of Admiral Boom, late of His Majesty's Navy. Likes his house shipshape, he does, shipshape and Bristol fashion at all times.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Time gun ready?

 
 Mr Binnacle:

 Ready and charged, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Three minutes and six seconds.

 
 Mr Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Bert:

 What he's famous for is punctuality. The whole world takes its time from Greenwich. But Greenwich, they say, takes its time from Admiral Boom. What cheer, admiral?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Good afternoon to you, young man. Where are you bound?

 
 Bert:

 Number 17. Got some parties here in tow what wants to see it.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Enter that in the log.

 
 Mr Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 A word of advice, young man: storm signals are up at number 17. Bit of heavy weather brewing there.

 
 Bert:

 Thank you, sir. Keep an eye skinned. Here we are. Number 17 Cherry Tree Lane. Residence of George Banks, Esquire. Hello, hello, hello. The admiral's right. Heavy weather brewin' at number 17, and no mistake.

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Leave her alone!

 
 Ellen:

 Shut up!

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 I'll show you. Don't you be trying to stop the wretched creature! Let her go, that's what I say, and good riddance! I never liked her from the moment she set foot in the door.

 
 Ellen:

 But who gets stuck with the children with no nanny in the house? Me, that's who!

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Her and her high and mighty ways! And that face of her that would stop a coal barge, it would.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Indeed, Mrs. Brill! I wouldn't stay in this house another minute, not if you heap me with all the jewels in Christendom.

 
 Ellen:

 No, no, Katie Nanna, don't go!

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Stand away from that door, my girl!

 
 Ellen:

 But what am I gonna tell the master about the children?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 It's no concern of mine. Those little beasts have run away from me for the last time.

 
 Ellen:

 They must be somewhere. Did you look around the zoo in the park? You know how Jane and Michael is. Coo! You don't think the lion could've got at them, do ya? You know how fond they was of hangin' around the cage.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 I said my say, and that's all I'll say. I've done with this house forever.

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Well, hip, hip, hooray! And don't stumble on the way out, dearie.

 
 Ellen:

 Now, now, Katie Nanna!

 Mrs. Banks! She's home!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Our daughter's daughters will adore us

 And we'll sing in grateful chorus

 "Well done, Sister Suffragette"

 Good evening, Katie Nanna, Ellen. We had the most glorious meeting! Mrs. Whitbourne-Allen chained herself to the wheel of the prime minister's carriage. You should've been there.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks, I would like a word with you.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 And Mrs. Ainslie, she was carried off to prison, singing and scattering pamphlets all the way!

 
 Katie Nanna:

 I'm glad you're home, madam. I've always given the best that's in me.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 On, thank you, Katie Nanna. I always knew you were one of us.

 We're clearly soldiers in petticoats

 And dauntless crusaders for women's votes

 Though we adore men individually

 We agree that as a group they're rather stupid

 
 Katie nanna:

 Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Cast off the shackles of yesterday

 Shoulder to shoulder into the fray

 Our daughter's daughters will adore us

 And they'll sing in grateful chorus

 "Well done, Sister Suffragette"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Being that as it may, I do not wish to offend, but I--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 From Kensington to Billingsgate

 One hears the restless cries

 From every corner of the land: womankind arise

 Political equality and equal rights with men

 Take heart for Mrs. Pankhurst has been clapped in irons again

 No more the meek and mild subservients we

 We're fighting for our rights, militantly - never you fear

 
 Katie Nanna:

 If I may have a word, Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 So cast off the shackles of yesterday

 

 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 And shoulder to shoulder into the fray

 Our daughter's daughters will adore us

 And they'll sing in grateful chorus - "well done"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 "Well done"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 "Well done, Sister Suf--"

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 What is it, Katie Nanna?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Mrs. Banks, I have something to say to you.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Where are the children?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 The children, madam, to be precise, are not here. They've disappeared again.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Katie Nanna, this is really too careless of you. Doesn't it make the third time this week?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 The fourth, madam. And I for one have had my fill of it. I'm not one to speak ill of the children, but--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, please, when do you expect them home?

 
 Katie Nanna:

 I really couldn't say. And now if you'd be good enough to compute my wages, I'll--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, gracious, Katie Nanna! You're not leaving? What will Mr. Banks say? He's going to be cross enough as it is to come home and find the children missing. Ellen, put these things away. You know how the cause infuriates Mr. Banks.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Katie Nanna, I beseech you. Please reconsider. Think of the children. Think of Mr. Banks. He was just beginning to get used to you.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Posts, everyone! Four, three, two, one. Fire!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Katie Nanna, I do beseech you--

 
 Katie Nanna:

 My wages, if you please.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Bit early tonight, aren't you, admiral?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Nonsense. Bang on the dot, as usual. How are things in the world of finance?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Never better. Money's sound. Credit rates are moving up, up, up. And the British pound is the admiration of the world.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Good man.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 How do things look from where you stand?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Bit chancy, I'd say. The wind's coming up and the glass is falling. - don't like the look of it.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Good, good, good.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Banks, shouldn't wonder if you weren't steering into a nasty piece of weather. Banks! Do you hear me?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Hello, Katie Nanna. That must be heavy. Allow me.

 
 Katie Nanna:

 Hmph!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What a very pretty hat.

 I feel a surge of deep satisfaction

 Much as a king astride his noble steed - thank you.

 When I return from daily strife, to hearth and wife

 How pleasant is the life I lead

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Dear, it's about the children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, yes, yes.

 I run my home precisely on schedule

 At 6:01 I march through my door

 My slippers, sherry and pipe are due at 6:02

 Consistent is the life I lead

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, they're missing.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Splendid. Splendid.

 It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910

 King Edward's on the throne it's the age of men

 I'm the lord of my castle the sovereign, the liege

 I treat my subjects, servants children, wife with a firm but gentle hand, noblesse oblige

 It's 6:03 and the heirs to my dominion

 Are scrubbed and tubbed and adequately fed

 And so I'll pat them on the head and send them off to bed

 Ah, lordly is the life I lead

 Winifred, where are the children?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 They're not here, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What? Well, of course they're here! Where else would they be?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I don't know, George

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You don't know?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Well, they're missing. Katie Nanna has looked everywhere.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Very well. I'll deal with this at once.

 Give me the police station, quickly, please.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I don't think we need bother the police, dear. The facts of the matter--

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Kindly do not attempt to cloud the issue with facts. One fact, and one fact alone is crystal clear! Katie Nanna's faltered at her post. She's let the family down. And I shall bring her to boo-- oh. She's left us, hasn't she?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, dear, only just.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What, uh-- yes. George Banks here. Yes. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. It's a matter of some urgency. I should like you to send a policeman around immediately.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 The policeman's here, George!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What? Oh, how very prompt. What wonderful service. Thank you so much. Good night. Come in, constable. Come in.

 
 Constable:

 Thank you, sir. While going about my duties on the other side of the park, I noted some valuables that had gone astray. I believe they're yours, sir.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Valuables?

 
 Constable:

 Come along, now. Come along.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Jane! Michael!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, please don't be emotional.

 
 Constable:

 Oh, I wouldn't be too hard on 'em, sir. They've had a long, weary walk today.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Children, come here at once. Well?

 
 Jane:

 I'm sorry we lost Katie Nanna, Father. You see, it was windy. And the kite was too strong for us.

 
 Constable:

 In a manner of speaking, sir, it was the kite that ran away, not the children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you, Constable. I think I can manage this.

 
 Jane:

 Actually it wasn't a very good kite. We made it ourselves. Perhaps if you helped us to make one--

 
 Constable:

 Ah, that's the ticket, sir. Kites are skittish things. Why, only last week with me own youngsters--

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I'm very grateful to you, Constable, for returning the children. And I'm sure that if you go to the kitchen, Cook'll find you a plate of something.

 
 Constable:

 Thank you, sir. I shall now return to my duties.

 
 Jane:

 Thank you, Constable.

 
 Constable:

 Good night, miss. Good night, ma'am. Good night, sir. Cook'll find me something. I never--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'm awfully sorry about this, George. I'll expect you'll want to discuss it.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I would indeed! Ellen, take Jane and Michael upstairs straightaway.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir. I knew it. When all's said and done, who bears the brunt of everything around here? Me, that's who! They don't want an honest, hard-workin' girl around here. They need a ruddy zookeeper.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'm sorry, dear, but when I chose Katie Nanna, I thought she would be firm with the children. She looked so solemn and cross.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, never confuse efficiency with a liver complaint.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'll try to do better next time.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Next time? My dear, you've engaged six nannies in the last four months! And they've all been unqualified disasters.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I quite agree.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Choosing a nanny for the children is an important and delicate task. It requires insight, balanced judgment, and an ability to read character. Under the circumstances, I think it might be apropos to take it upon myself to, uh, select the next person.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, would you, George?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Obviously the way to find a proper nanny, is to go about it in a proper fashion. I shall put an advertisement in The Times. Take this down please.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, of course, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Wanted. Uh, no. Uh, required. Nanny: firm, respectable, no nonsense.

 A British nanny must be a general

 The future empire lies within her hands

 And so the person that we need

 To mold the breed

 Is a nanny who can give commands

 You getting this, Winifred?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, yes, dear. Every word.

 A British bank is run with precision

 A British home requires nothing less

 Tradition, discipline and rules must be the tools

 Without them, disorder, catastrophe, anarchy

 In short you have a ghastly mess

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Splendid, George! Inspirational. The Times will be so pleased.

 
 Jane:

 Father?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes?

 
 Jane:

 We've discussed everything, and we're very sorry about what we did today.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I should certainly think so.

 
 Jane:

 It was wrong to run away from Katie Nanna.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 It was indeed.

 
 Jane:

 And we do so want to get on with the new nanny.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Very sensible. I shall be glad to have your help in the matter.

 
 Jane:

 We thought you would. That's why we wrote this advertisement.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Advertisement for what?

 
 Jane:

 For the new nanny.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You wrote an advert--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, I think we should listen.

 
 Jane:

 You said you wanted our help.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 But, I-- oh, very well.

 
 Jane:

 "Wanted: a nanny for two adorable children."

 
 Mr. Banks:

 "Adorable." well, that's debatable, I must say.

 
 Jane:

 If you want this choice position

 Have a cheery disposition

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane, I don't--

 
 Jane:

 Rosy cheeks, no warts

 
 Michael:

 That's the part I put in.

 
 Jane:

 Play games, all sorts

 You must be kind you must be witty

 Very sweet and fairly pretty

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, of all the ridic-

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, please!

 
 Jane:

 Take us on outings give us treats

 Sing songs bring sweets

 Never be cross or cruel never give us castor oil or gruel

 Love us as a son and daughter

 And never smell of barley water

 
 Michael:

 I put that in, too.

 
 Jane:

 If you won't scold and dominate us

 We will never you give you cause to hate us

 We won't hide your spectacles so you can't see

 Put toads in your bed or pepper in your tea

 Hurry, nanny

 Many thanks

 Sincerely

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Jane and Michael Banks

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you. Most interesting. And now I think we've had quite enough of this nonsense. Please return to the nursery.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 They were only trying to help. They're just children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I'm well aware they're just children, Winifred. I only congratulate myself that I decided to step in and take a hand. "Play games, sing songs, give treats." Ridiculous. There's no question in my mind whatsoever. Now is the time for action.

 Give me The Times, please. No, I do not know the number.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, George, you're always so forceful.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 The Times? George Banks here. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. I wish to place an advertisement in your column.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Time gun ready?

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Ready and charged, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 I'll take the report, Mr. Binnacle.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 The wind has changed, Sir. Seems to be comin' in from a new quarter.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 So it is.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Sir?

 
 Admiral Boom:

 What is it?

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Bit of somethin' or other taking place off the port bow.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Ghastly looking crew, I must say!

 
 Ellen:

 Coo! There's a fair queue of nannies outside, sir. Shall I show 'em in?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, I said 8:00, and 8:00 it shall jolly well be. You see? Twelve seconds to go. Ten, nine, eight---

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Posts! Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, it is now 8:00.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 But I have told you time and time again, Ellen, I dislike being hurried into things.

 
 Jane:

 I don't understand. They're not what we advertised for at all.

 Michael, look!

 
 Michael:

 Perhaps it's a witch.

 
 Jane:

 Of course not. Witches have brooms.

 It's her. It's the person. She's answered our advertisement.

 
 Michael:

 Rosy cheeks and everything.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, you may now show them in, one at a time.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir. You may come in one at a time.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Ellen:

 Oh.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You are the father of Jane and Michael Banks, are you not? I said, you are the father of Jane and Michael Banks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, well ye-- yes, of course, I mean. Uh-- you brought your references, I presume. May I see them?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, I make it a point never to give references. A very old-fashioned idea to my mind.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Is that so? We'll have to see about that then, won't we?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now then, the qualifications. "Item one: a cheery disposition." I am never cross. "Item two: rosy cheeks." Obviously. "Item three: play games, all sorts." Well, I'm sure the children will find my games extremely diverting.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 May I? Eh, this paper? Where did you get it from? I thought I tore it up.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Excuse me. "Item four: you must be kind." I am kind, but extremely firm. Have you lost something?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ah! Yeah. That paper, you see. I thought that I--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You are George Banks, are you not?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And you did advertise for a nanny, did you not?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 George Banks.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well then.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I tore it up, turned it over. Tore it up again and threw it in there. Yes.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I beg your pardon. Are you ill?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I hope not.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, about my wages. The reference here is very obscure.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Very obscure.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 We must be very clear on that point, mustn't we?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, we must indeed.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I shall require every second Tuesday off.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Every Tuesday.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 On second thoughts, I believe a trial period would be wise. Hmm. I'll give you one week. I'll know by then. I'll see the children now. Thank you.

 
 Close your mouth please, Michael. We are not a codfish. Well, don't stand there staring. Best foot forward. Spit spot!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George? Aah! George, what on earth are you doing? I thought you were interviewing nannies.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I was! I was!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 You mean you've selected one already?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, it's done. It's, it's all done.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Well, where is she?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What? Well, eh, she's in the nursery of course, I mean. I put her to work straightaway, I mean.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 How clever of you! I would have muddled the whole thing. Tell me, is she everything that we'd hoped she be?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, I - it all happened rather quickly. I mean, I-- I, uh--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Will she be firm? Will she give commands? Will she mold our young breed?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You know, Winifred, I think she will. I think she will.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 In that case, perhaps you'd better tell Ellen to dismiss the others.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The others? Oh, yes. Ellen?

 
 Ellen:

 Y-yes, sir?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Tell the other applicants they may go. The position has been filled.

 
 Ellen:

 The others, sir?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, the others. How many n-nannies does she think we need in this house?

 
 Ellen:

 The position has been filled.

 
 Jane:

 I'm afraid the nursery isn't very tidy.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 It is rather like a bear pit, isn't it?

 
 Michael:

 That's a funny sort of bag.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Carpet.

 
 Michael:

 You mean to carry carpets in?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 No. Made of.

 
 Jane:

 This is your room, and there's a lovely view of the park.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Hmm. Well, it's not exactly Buckingham Palace. Still, it's clean. Yes, I think it will be quite suitable. Just needs a touch here and there. Well, first things first. I always say, the place to hang a hat is on a hat stand. Ah! This will never do! I much prefer seeing all of my face at the same time.

 
 Michael:

 There-- but there was nothing in it.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Never judge things by their appearance. Even carpetbags. I'm sure I never do. A thing of beauty is a joy forever. Mmm, a little more light, perhaps.

 
 Michael:

 We better keep an eye on this one. She's tricky.

 
 Jane:

 She's wonderful.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Much better! Now, let me see. That's funny. I always carry it with me. It must be here somewhere.

 
 Michael:

 What?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 My tape measure.

 
 Michael:

 What do you want it for?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I want to see how you two measure up. Well, that's the funniest thing I ever saw. I know it's down here somewhere. Ah, ha-ha, ha-ha! Here it is. Good. Come along, then. Quickly. Head up, Michael. Don't slouch. Just as I thought. Extremely stubborn and suspicious.

 
 Michael:

 I am not!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 See for yourself.

 
 Michael:

 "Extremely stubborn and sus--"

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Suspicious.

 Now you, Jane. Mmm. "Rather inclined to giggle. Doesn't put things away."

 
 Michael:

 How 'bout you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well. Hold this for me. As I expected. "Mary Poppins. Practically perfect in every way."

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins! Is that your name? It's lovely.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you. I've always liked it. Now, shall we get on with it?

 
 Jane:

 Get on with what?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 In your advertisement, did you not specifically request to play games?

 
 Jane:

 Oh, yes!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well, then. Our first game is called "well begun is half done."

 
 Michael:

 I don't like the sound of that.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Otherwise entitled, "let's tidy up the nursery."

 
 Michael:

 I told you she was tricky.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Shall we begin?

 
 Jane:

 It is a game, isn't it, Mary Poppins?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, it depends on your point of view. You see,

 In every job that must be done,

 There is an element of fun.

 You find the fun, and snap!

 The job's a game.

 And every task you undertake

 Becomes a piece of cake

 A lark, a spree it's very clear to see

 That a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 In a most delightful way

 A robin feathering his nest

 Has very little time to rest

 While gathering his bits of twine and twig

 Though quite intent in his pursuit,

 He has a merry tune to toot

 He knows a song will move the job along

 For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 In a most delightful way

 The honeybees that fetch the nectar from the flowers to the comb

 Never tire of ever buzzing to and fro

 Because they take a little nip from every flower that they sip

 And hence

 
 Reflection:

 And hence

 
 Mary Poppins:

 They find

 
 Reflection:

 They find

 
 Mary Poppins & Reflection:

 Their task is not a grind

 Mary Poppins:

 Cheeky.

 Don't be all day about it, please.

 
 Michael:

 Let me out! Let me out! Let me out!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, that was very--

 Thank you now-- when you've quite finished!

 Thank you. That will be quite sufficient. Hats and coats, please. It's time for our outing in the park.

 
 Michael:

 I don't want an outing. I want to tidy up the nursery again.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Enough is as good as a feast. Come along, please. Let me look at you. Well, you're not as well turned out as I'd like. Still, there's time. There's time. Spit spot! And off we go.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 For a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine

 Go down in the most delightful way

 
 Bert:

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 I does what I likes and I likes what I do

 Hello, art lovers.

 Today I'm a screever and as you can see

 A screever's an artist of highest degree

 And it's all me own work

 From me own memory

 Well, not Royal Academy, I suppose. Still they're better than a finger in your eye, ain't they?

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 I draws what I likes and I likes what I drew

 No remuneration do I ask of you

 But me cap would be glad of a copper or two

 Me cap would be glad of a copper or two

 Wait! Don't move. Don't move a muscle. Stay right where you are. I'd know that silhouette anywhere! Mary Poppins!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 It's nice to see you again, Bert. I expect you know Jane and Michael.

 
 Bert:

 Well, I've seen 'em here and about. Chasin' a kite last time, weren't it?

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins is taking us to the park.

 
 Bert:

 To the park? Not if I know Mary Poppins. Other nannies take children to the park. When you're with Mary Poppins, suddenly you're in places you've never dreamed of. And quick as you can say "Bob's your uncle," the most unusual things begin to happen.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I'm sure I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.

 
 Bert:

 Well mind, it's not my place to say, but what she's probably got in mind, is a jolly holiday somewheres or other. Something along these lines, I shouldn't be surprised. "Punting on the Thames." That's always good if you like an outing. Here we go.

 The circus. How about a lovely circus? Lions and tigers. World-famous artistes performing death-defyin' feats, of dexterity and skill before your very eyes. Ta-da! Ta-da!

 
 Jane:

 Oh, that's lovely. If you please, I'd much rather go there.

 
 Bert:

 Beautiful, ain't it? A typical English countryside, as done by a true and lovin' hand. Though you can't see it, there's a little country fair down that road and uh, over the hill.

 
 Michael:

 I don't see any road.

 
 Bert:

 What? No road? Just wants a bit of somethin' here, and a bit of somethin' there. There. A country road suitable for travel and high adventure.

 
 Jane:

 Please may we go, Mary Poppins? Please? Such a lovely place. Don't you think it's lovely, Mary Poppins?

 
 Bert:

 Now's the time, Mary Poppins. No one's lookin'.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Please, Mary Poppins. Please! Please, Mary Poppins. Please!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I have no intention of making a spectacle of myself, thank you.

 
 Bert:

 All right, I'll do it myself.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Do what?

 
 Bert:

 Bit of magic.

 
 Michael:

 A bit of magic?

 
 Bert:

 It's easy. Let's see. You think. You wink. You do a double blink. You close your eyes and jump.

 
 Jane:

 Is something 'sposed to happen?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Bert, what utter nonsense! Ohh! Why do you always complicate things that are really quite simple? Give my your hand, please, Michael. Don't slouch. One, two.

 
 Bert:

 Mary Poppins, you look beautiful.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Do you really think so?

 
 Bert:

 Cross my heart you do. Like the day I met ya.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You look fine, too, Bert.

 
 Michael:

 I thought you said there was a fair.

 
 Bert:

 So I did. Down the road behind the hill, remember?

 
 Jane:

 Come on! I hear the merry-go-round.

 
 Bert:

 Tell 'em Bert sent ya.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Don't fall and smudge the drawing.

 
 Bert:

 Ain't it a glorious day

 Right as a mornin' in May

 I feel like I could fly

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, Bert. None of your larking about.

 
 Bert:

 Have you ever seen

 The grass so green

 Or a bluer sky

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

 Mary makes your heart so light

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You haven't changed a bit, have you?

 
 Bert:

 When the day is gray and ordinary

 Mary makes the sun shine bright

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, honestly!

 
 Bert:

 Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

 The daffodils are smilin' at the dove

 When Mary holds your hand you feel so grand

 Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You are lightheaded.

 
 Bert:

 It's a jolly holiday with Mary

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 
 Animals:

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with Mary

 Mary makes your heart so light

 When the day is gray and ordinary

 Mary makes the sun shine bright

 Oh, happiness is bloomin' all around her

 The daffodils are smiling at the dove oink, oink.

 When Mary holds your hand

 You feel so grand

 Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

 It's a jolly holiday with Mary

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Turtles:

 Our pleasure, Mary Poppins.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

 Gentlemen like you are few

 
 Bert:

 A vanishing breed, that's me.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Though you're just a diamond in the rough, Bert

 Underneath your blood is blue

 
 Bert:

 Common knowledge.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You'd never think of pressing your advantage

 Forbearance is the hallmark of your creed

 
 Bert:

 True.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 A lady needn't fear

 When you are near

 Your sweet gentility is crystal clear

 Oh, it's a jolly holiday with you, Bert

 A jolly, jolly holiday with you

 
 Bert:

 Waiter! Waiter!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now then, what'd be nice?

 We'll start with raspberry ice

 and then some cakes and tea

 
 Waiter

 Order what you will

 There'll be no bill

 It's complimentary

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You're very kind.

 
 Waiter:

 Anything for you, Mary Poppins. You're our favorite person.

 
 Bert:

 Right you are.

 
 It's true that Mavis and Sybil have ways that are winnin'

 And Prudence and Gwendolyn set your hearts spinnin'

 Phoebe's delightful

 Maude is disarming

 
 Waiters:

 Janice Felicia Lydia

 
 Bert:

 .. charming

 Cynthia's dashing,

 Vivian's sweet,

 Stephanie's smashing

 Priscilla a treat

 
 Waiters:

 Veronica Millicent Agnes and Jane

 
 Bert:

 convivial company time and again

 Dorcas and Phyllis and Glynis are sorts

 I'll agree they're three jolly good sports

 But cream of the crop

 Tip of the top

 
 Bert & Waiters:

 Is Mary Poppins

 And there we stop

 
 When Mary holds your hand

 You feel so grand

 Your heart starts beatin' like a big brass band

 It's a jolly holiday with Mary

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 No wonder that it's Mary that we love

 
 Michael:

 Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! Ya-hoo! -ya-hoo!

 
 Jane:

 Our own private merry-go-round.

 
 Bert

 Very nice. Very nice, indeed, if you don't wanna go nowhere.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Who says we're not going anywhere? Oh, guard!

 
 Guard:

 Righto, Mary Poppins.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Guard:

 They're off! It's Mary Poppins leadin' by two lengths. Jane is second by a length. Michael third.

 
 Michael:

 My horse is the fastest.

 
 Bert:

 Do you hear that, mate? Do you wanna put up with that? That's the ticket! Come on, my lad. Is that the best you can do?

 
 Michael:

 Hurry up, boy. Hurry up!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Not so fast, please. Michael! Now really, Bert. You're as bad as the children.

 
 Bert:

 Sorry. Whoa, boy! Whoa! Whoa. Easy, boy. Whoa. Whoa. Just a bit of high spirits, Mary Poppins.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Please control yourself. We are not on a racecourse.

 Follow me, please.

 Good morning.

 
 Hunter:

 Oh, yes, quite. Wha-- I say! Have you ever?

 
 Horse:

 Never!

 
 Hunter:

 View halloo!

 
 Horse:

 Oh, yes, definitely. A view halloo.

 
 Fox:

 View halloo?

 Faith and begorra! 'Tis them redcoats again!

 
 Dogs:

 View halloo! View halloo! View halloo!

 
 Fox:

 Oh, musha, musha.

 
 Bert:

 Poor lit'l bloke. Let's give him a hand.

 
 Fox:

 Saints preserve us! Yikes!

 
 
 Tally ho!

 
 Bert:

 Da-doo, da-doo! Up you go. Now hang on.

 
 Fox:

 Would you look at that now? 'Tis an elegant merry-go-round horse. Come on and fight, you dirty omadhauns. I can lick the lot of ya's. Faster, me beauty! Faster!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, riders, would you be so kind as to let me pass?

 
 Horse Rider:

 Certainly, ma'am.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you.

 
 Horse Rider:

 Not at all, ma'am.

 
 Spectator 1:

 Excellent time, gentlemen.

 
 Spectator 2:

 Oh, yes, quite. - perfect day for it, of course.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh. Oh, how nice.

 
 Crowd:

 Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

 
 Photographer:

 Hold still, now. Watch for the dickie bird.

 
 Reporter 1:

 Uh, how does it feel, Mary Poppins, winning the race?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, well I--

 
 Reporter 2:

 - gaining fame and fortune.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, yes.

 
 Reporter 3:

 Having your picture taken for the newspaper.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, oh, actually, I'm delighted.

 
 Reporter 4:

 Besides having your extreme good looks, if I may say so.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, well, I wouldn't go--

 
 Reporter 3:

 There probably aren't words to describe your emotions.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, now, now, now, gentlemen, please. On the contrary, there's a very good word. Am I right, Bert?

 
 Bert:

 Tell 'em what it is.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Right! It's ...

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

 If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Group:

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Bert:

 Because I was afraid to speak when I was just a lad

 Me father gave me nose a tweak and told me I was bad

 But then one day I learned a word that saved me achin' nose

 
 Bert & Mary Poppins:

 The biggest word you ever heard and this is how it goes

 Oh, supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

 If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Group:

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Mary Poppins:

 He's traveled all around the world and everywhere he went

 He'd use his word and all would say, "there goes a clever gent"

 
 Bert:

 When dukes and maharajahs pass the time of day with me

 I'd say me special word and then they'd ask me out to tea

 
 Bert & Mary Poppins:

 Ooh, supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Even though the sound of it is something quite atrocious

 If you say it loud enough you'll always sound precocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 Um diddle diddle diddle um diddle ay

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You know, you can say it backwards,

 Which is, Dociousaliexpiistic- fragilcalirupus.

 But that's going a bit too far, don't you think?

 
 Bert:

 Indubitably.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 So when the cat has got your tongue there's no need for dismay

 
 Bert:

 Hear, hear!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Just summon up this word and then you've got a lot to say

 But better use it carefully or it could change your life

 
 Drummer:

 For example.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Yes?

 
 Drummer:

 One night I said it to me girl, and now me girl's me wife.

 Ow! And a lovely thing she is, too.

 
 Group:

 She's supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Jane! Michael! Stay close now. Oh, Bert, all your fine drawings.

 
 Bert:

 Well, there's more where they came from. Meantime, I'm changing businesses. This here is lovely hot chestnut weather.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Come along, children. Bye, Bert.

 
 Bert:

 Bye-bye.

 
 Jane:

 Bye, Bert.

 
 Bert:

 Bye. Bye, Jane and Michael.

 
 Michael:

 Bye, Bert.

 
 Bert:

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 La dum da da dum da da da da dum

 
 Michael:

 No, no, I won't take your nasty medicine!

 
 Jane:

 Do we have to, Mary Poppins?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 People who get their feet wet, must learn to take their medicine.

 
 Michael:

 I don't want it. I'm not gonna--

 
 Jane:

 Oh! Lime cordial! Delicious!

 
 Michael:

 Strawberry! Mmm!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 R-r-rum punch. Quite satisfactory.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, you won't ever leave us, will you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Do you have a handkerchief under your pillow? Mm-hmm.

 
 Michael:

 Will you stay if we promise to be good?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Och! That's a piecrust promise. Easily made, easily broken.

 
 Jane:

 Whatever would we do without you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I shall stay until the wind changes.

 
 Michael:

 But, Mary Poppins, how long will that be?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Silence, please. It's time to go to sleep.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, we couldn't possibly go to sleep! So many lovely things have happened today.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Did they?

 
 Jane:

 Yes! When we jumped into Bert's chalk picture.

 
 Michael:

 And we rode the merry-go-round, and all the horses jumped off, and--

 
 Jane:

 And we all went riding in the countryside!

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Tally ho! Tchunga! Tchunga! Yikes!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Really?

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, don't you remember? You won the horse race!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 A respectable person like me in a horse race? How dare you suggest such a thing.

 
 Michael:

 But I saw you do it!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, not another word or I shall have to summon the policeman. Is that clear?

 
 Michael:

 It did happen! I saw it!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Go to sleep.

 
 Michael:

 No, I don't want to go to sleep.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, we're much too excited!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Very well, suit yourselves.

 Stay awake don't rest your head

 Don't lie down upon your bed

 While the moon drifts in the skies

 Stay awake don't close your eyes

 Though the world is fast asleep

 Though your pillow's soft and deep

 You're not sleepy as you seem

 Stay awake don't nod and dream

 Stay awake don't nod and dream

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Glorious day, Mr. Binnacle. Glorious! No one sleeps this morning. Put in a double charge of powder.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 A double charge? Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Shake things up a bit, what?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Lovely, lovely morning, Ellen.

 
 Ellen:

 Indeed it is, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Have you put the spoiled eggs in my carryall?

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 After our meeting at the Albert Hall, we're all going to Downing street, to throw things at the prime minister. Oh, how distinguished you look this morning, George.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What's all that fearful caterwauling in the kitchen?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 It's cook singing.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Cook singing? What's wrong with her?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 She's happy as a cricket. As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Is that so?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Take Ellen for instance. She hasn't broken a dish all morning.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Really? Well, that is extraordinary.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 And another thing. She and Cook usually fight like cats and dogs, but today--

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Let me hold the door for you, Ellen dear.

 
 Ellen:

 Thanks ever so, ducks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Ellen, stop making that offensive noise! And shut the window! That bird's giving me a headache.

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, sir. Quiet! You're giving the master a headache.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I'm so sorry you're not feeling well this morning, George.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Who said I'm not feeling well? I'm fit as a fiddle. I just don't understand why everyone's so confoundedly cheerful!

 Jane & Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 How lovely. Thank you, my darling.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic-expialidocious

 
 Jane, Michael, Ellen & Mrs. Brill:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Stop! Stop! Stop!

 
 Jane:

 Good morning, Father.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Good morning.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins taught us the most wonderful words.

 
 Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mr. Banks:

 What on earth are you talking about? Supercali-- super-- or whatever the infernal thing is.

 
 Jane:

 It's something to say when you don't know what to say.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, well, I always know what to say. Go on, hurry along, please.

 
 Jane:

 Yes, father.

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, will you be good enough to explain this unseemly hullabaloo?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I don't think there's anything to explain, do you? It's obvious that you're out of sorts this morning. The children just came in to make you feel better.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I should like to make one thing quite clear, once and for all. I am not out of sorts. I am in a perfectly equable mood. I don't require being made to feel better!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 But you're always saying that you wanted a cheerful and pleasant household.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, I should like to make a slight differentiation between the word cheerful and just plain giddy irresponsibility.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Excuse me, dear. Posts, everyone, please!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I have no objection to anyone being cheerful or pleasant. But I do expect a certain decorum. I can tell you one thing, Winifred. I don't propose standing idly by and letting that woman, Mary Poppins, undermine the discipline and-- there's something odd, I may say extremely odd about the behavior of this household since that woman arrived. And I want you to know that I've noticed it!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 One thing more.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Yes, dear?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I suggest you have this piano repaired. When I sit down to an instrument, I like to have it in tune.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 But, George, you don't play.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Madam, that is entirely beside the point!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, let me see. First of all, we must go to the piano tuners. And then we go to Mrs. Cory's sh-- Mrs. Cory's shop for some gingerbread.

 
 Jane:

 Ah, gingerbread!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And then we go to the fishmonger's, I think, for a nice dover sole and a pint of prawns. Uh, Michael, stop stravaging along behind.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Ahoy, there! Ahoy! Good day to you!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Good morning, Admiral.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Michael, what fine adventure are we off upon today? Going to fight the Hottentots? Dig for buried treasure?

 
 Michael:

 We're going to buy some fish.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Very good! Proceed at flank speed.

 
 Michael:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Let's put our backs into it, lad. More spit and polish. That's what's wanted around here.

 
 Jane:

 It's Andrew!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, not so fast, please. I can't understand a word you're saying. Again? Och! Oh, the poor man! Bless you. Well, yes, of course. There's not a moment to lose. I'll go straightaway. And thank you very much.

 
 Jane:

 What did he say?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 He said, "you're welcome."

 
 Jane:

 What else did he say?

 
 Michael:

 I don't think he said anything.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You know best, as usual.

 
 Jane:

 I thought we were gonna buy some fish.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 There's been a change of plans. Come along, please. Don't straggle.

 Andrew, worrying won't help anyone. Why don't you go home and put your feet up?

 Oh, Bert, I'm glad you're here.

 
 Bert:

 I came over the moment I heard.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, how is he?

 
 Bert:

 I've never seen him as bad as this, and that's the truth.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh!

 
 Bert:

 How about them? It's contagious, you know.

 
 Jane:

 Shall we get spots?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, highly unlikely.

 Oh, uncle Albert!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, bless me. Bless my soul. It's Mary Poppins! I'm delight-- -I'm delighted to see you, Mary.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uncle Albert, you promised!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, I kn-- I know, I-- but I tried. Really, I did, my dear. I-- but I so enjoy laughing, you know? And, well-- and when I start, it's all up with the-- that's what happens to me. I love to laugh! Oh, my goodness! I can't help it. You can see that. I just like laughing, that's all.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Jane, don't you dare! You'll only make him worse. It's really quite serious!

 
 Bert:

 Yes, whatever you do, keep a straight face. Last time, it took us three days to get him down.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 I love to laugh

 Loud and long and clear

 I love to laugh

 It's getting worse every year

 The more I laugh

 The more I fill with glee

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You're no help at all.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 The more the glee

 The more I'm a merrier me

 It's embarrassing.

 The more I'm a merrier me

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Some people laugh through their noses

 Sounding something like this -- dreadful!

 Some people laugh through their teeth, goodness sakes

 Hissing and fizzing like snakes

 Not at all attractive to my way of thinking.

 
 Bert:

 Some laugh too fast

 Some only blast

 Others, they twitter like birds

 
 Mary Poppins:

 You know, you're as bad as he is.

 
 Bert:

 Then there's that kind what can't make up their mind

 
 Uncle Albert:

 When things strike me as funny I can't hide it inside

 And squeak as the squeakelers do

 I've got to let go with a ho ho ho ho

 And laugh too

 How nice! I was hoping you'd turn up.

 
 Bert:

 Turn up!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 We always have such a jolly time.

 
 Uncle Albert & Bert:

 We love to laugh

 Loud and long and clear

 We love to laugh

 So everybody can hear

 The more you laugh

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Whoops, don't you two start. Come back down here.

 
 Uncle Albert & Bert:

 The more you fill with glee

 The more the glee

 The more we're a merrier we

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, welcome, children! Welcome! Make yourselves comfortable.

 
 Bert:

 That's right. Pull up a chair.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, pull up--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I must say, you're a sight, the lot of you!

 
 Bert:

 Speaking of sight, it reminds me of me brother. He's got a nice cushy job in a watch factory.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 In a watch factory? What does he do?

 
 Bert:

 He stands about all day and makes faces!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 He makes faces in a watch fact-- you made that up.

 
 Bert:

 I know.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 That's so good!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Such behaviour! Well, it's the most disgraceful sight I've ever seen, or my name isn't Mary Poppins.

 
 Bert:

 Speaking of names, I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 What's the name of his other leg? Wasn't that funny? What's the name of his other--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Now, then, children, it's time for tea. I will not have my schedule interrupted.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, please stay. Look, I have a splendid tea all ready for you.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And it's getting cold!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Well, I had hoped that maybe, that you would just, that-- splendid! Thank you very much! Keep your feet back. Mind the bread and butter. Now, watch it, children.

 
 Bert:

 I knew she could bring it off. And a proper tea it is, too.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Next thing, I suppose, you'll be wanting me to pour out. Oh, well. If I must, I must. If you'll just stop behaving like a pack of laughing hyenas! Two lumps, uncle Albert?

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Yes, please.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, Bert?

 
 Bert:

 Uh, no, no, thank you. No sugar for me.

 
 Jane:

 I'm so glad you came. It wouldn't be any fun without you.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Here, and you may pour some milk for Michael and yourself.

 
 Bert:

 Nice weather we're having this time of year, don't you think?

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, yeah. Uh, speaking of weather, the other day when it was so cold, a friend of mine went to buy some long underwear, you know. The shopkeeper said to him, "How long do you want it?" and my friend said, "Well, from about September to March."

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Jane! Control yourself! Children, will you please sit up properly at the table? Your tea, uncle Albert.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, thank you, my dear. I'm having such a good time. I wish that you could all stay up here all the time.

 
 Michael:

 We'll jolly well have to. There's no way to get down.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, no, there is a way. Frankly I, I don't like to mention it, because you have to think of something sad.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Then do get on with it, please!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Let me see. I've got the very thing. Yesterday when the lady next door answered the bell, there was a man there. And the man said to the lady, "I'm terribly sorry. I just ran over your cat."

 
 Jane:

 Oh, that's sad.

 
 Michael:

 The poor cat.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 And then the man said, "I'd like to replace your cat." and the lady said, "That's all right with me, but how are you at catching mice?"

 Well, you know I started out sad. I, I try, really I do. But, but everything ends up so hilarious, I can't-- I can't help--

 Mary Poppins:

 That will be quite enough of that! It's time to go home.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, that is sad.

 
 Michael:

 Oh, no!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Oh, that's sad. That's the saddest thing I ever heard.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Come along, children. Spit spot!

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Must you really go? You know, people come to see me all the time, you know. And, and we have such a lovely time, and then they have to go home. And, and I'm very, very sad about the whole thing.

 
 Michael:

 Don't worry. We'll come back soon.

 
 Jane:

 We had a lovely time.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Uh, keep an eye on uncle Albert, will you, Bert?

 
 Bert:

 I'll sit with him a while.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Thank you. Come on.

 
 Bert:

 Uncle Albert, I got a jolly joke I saved for just such an occasion. Would you like to hear it?

 
 Uncle Albert:

 I'd be so grateful.

 
 Bert:

 Righto. Well, it's about me granddad, see? And one night, he had a nightmare, he did. So scared that he chewed his pillow to bits. Yes. To bits.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Yes.

 
 Bert:

 Next morning I says, "How do you feel, granddad?"

 
 Uncle Albert:

 Yes.

 
 Bert:

 He says, "Oh, not bad. A little down in the mouth!"

 Yeah, I always say there's nothing like a good joke.

 
 Uncle Albert:

 No. And that was nothing like a good joke! That-

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Bit late tonight, aren't you, Banks? I say, Banks! Is anything the matter, Banks? Banks!

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Father, we're so glad you're home!

 
 Michael:

 Want to hear a joke?

 
 Jane:

 We had the most wonderful afternoon with Mary Poppins.

 
 Michael:

 Speaking of afternoons, the joke goes like this. I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Smith? We don't know anyone called Smith.

 
 Michael:

 And there was a second chap, and the second chap says, "What's the name of his other leg?"

 
 Jane:

 And we had a lovely tea party on the ceiling!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh, children, please be quiet.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins says if we're good, she'll take us there again.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh. Oh, Mary Poppins said that, did she? Will you please return to your room. Mary Poppins, will you be kind enough to come with me?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 As you wish.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Mary Poppins, I very much regret what I must say to you.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Good evening, George. Is anything the matter?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I'm afraid there is.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I, I'd love to stay, but I have to dress for my rally in Hampstead.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, it is my wish that you be present!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, yes, George, of course.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Mary Poppins, I must confess I am extremely disappointed in you.

 
 Ellen:

 She's for it now. I've heard the master do this speech before.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I don't deny that I am partially responsible for allowing the children to spend their days on worthless frivolity to the exclusion of all else! But it is high time they learned the seriousness of life!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 But, George, they're only children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Precisely. And in the light of what has happened--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, are you certain you know what you're doing?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I believe I do, Winifred.

 A British bank is run with precision

 A British home requires nothing less

 Tradition, discipline and rules

 Must be the tools

 Without them disorder, chaos, moral disintegration

 In short you have a ghastly mess

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I quite agree.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The children must be molded shaped and taught

 That life's a looming battle to be faced and fought

 In short, I am disturbed to hear my children talking about popping in and out of chalk pavement pictures, consorting with racehorse persons, fox hunting. Yes, well I don't mind that quite so much. At any rate, it's traditional. But tea parties on the ceiling? I ask you. Having tea parties on the ceiling and highly-questionable outings of every other kind!

 If they must go on outings

 These outings ought to be

 Fraught with purpose yes, and practicality

 These silly words like

 Superca-- super-- superca-

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, well done. You said it.

 And popping through pictures

 Have little use, fulfill no basic need

 They've got to learn the honest truth

 Despite their youth

 They must learn

 
 Mary Poppins:

 About the life you lead

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Exactly.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 They must feel the thrill of totting up a balanced book

 A thousand ciphers neatly in a row

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Quite right.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 When gazing at a graph that shows the profits up

 Their little cup of joy should overflow

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Precisely!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 It's time they learned to walk in your footsteps

 
 Mr. Banks:

 My footsteps.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 To tread your straight and narrow path with pride

 
 Mr. Banks:

 With pride.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Tomorrow just as you suggest

 Pressed and dressed

 Jane and Michael will be at your side

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Splendid! You hit the nail right on the-- at my side? Where are we going?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 To the bank, of course, exactly as you proposed.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I proposed?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Of course. Now, if you'll excuse me. Tomorrow's an important day for the children. I shall see they have a proper night's sleep. Good night.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Winifred, did I say that I was going to take the children to the bank?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 It certainly sounded that way, dear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh. And why not? A capital idea! Just the medicine they need for all this slipshod, sugary female thinking they get around here all day long. Quite right. Good idea. Quite right. Good idea. Quite right.

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, we won't let you go!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Go? What on earth are you talking about?

 
 Michael:

 Didn't you get sacked?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Sacked? Certainly not! I am never sacked!

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Mary Poppins!

 
 Jane & Michael:

 Hurrah, hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Neither am I a Maypole. Kindly stop spinning about me.

 
 Michael:

 But?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Goats butt, birds fly, and children who are going on an outing with their father must get some sleep. Come along, please.

 
 Jane:

 An outing with father?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Yes.

 
 Michael:

 I don't believe it.

 
 Jane:

 He's never taken us on an outing before.

 
 Michael:

 He's never taken us anywhere.

 
 Jane:

 However did you manage it?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Manage what?

 
 Jane:

 You must've put the idea in his head somehow.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 What an impertinent thing to say! Me putting ideas into people's heads? Really!

 
 Jane:

 Where's he taking us?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 To the bank.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Michael, the city! And we'll see all the sights, and father can point them out to us.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, most things he can. But sometimes a person we love through no fault of his own, can't see past the end of his nose.

 
 Jane:

 Past the end of his nose?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Yes. Sometimes a little thing can be quite important.

 
 Michael:

 Oh, look! The cathedral.

 
 Jane:

 Father passes that every day. He sees that.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Early each day to the steps of St. Paul's

 The little old bird woman comes

 In her own special way to the people she calls

 Come buy my bags full of crumbs

 Come feed the little birds show them you care

 And you'll be glad if you do

 Their young ones are hungry

 Their nests are so bare

 All it takes is tuppence from you

 Feed the birds tuppence a bag

 Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

 Feed the birds that's what she cries

 While overhead her birds fill the skies

 All around the cathedral

 The saints and apostles

 Look down as she sells her wares

 Although you can't see it

 You know they are smiling

 Each time someone shows that he cares

 Though her words are simple and few

 Listen, listen she's calling to you

 Feed the birds tuppence a bag

 Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

 Though her words are simple and few

 Listen, listen she's calling to you

 Feed the birds tuppence a bag

 Tuppence, tuppence tuppence a bag

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Now remember that a bank is a quiet and decorous place, so we must be on our best behaviour.

 
 Michael:

 But I thought it was your bank.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, well, I'm one of the younger officers, so in a sense it is, sort of.

 
 Jane:

 Michael, look! It's her!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Who? It's who?

 
 Jane:

 The bird woman. Just where Mary Poppins said she would be. You do see her, don't you, Father?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, of course I can see her. Do you think I can't see past the end of my nose?

 
 Jane:

 Listen, Father, she's saying it.

 
 Birdwoman:

 Feed the birds. Tuppence a bag.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, of course she's saying it. What else would she be saying?

 
 Jane:

 Please may we feed the birds?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Whatever for?

 
 Michael:

 I have tuppence from my money box.

 
 Jane:

 Just this once, please?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Waste your money on a lot of ragamuffin birds? Certainly not.

 
 Jane:

 But Mary Poppins-

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I am not interested in what Mary Poppins says. Nor do I wish to keep hearing her name for the remainder of the day. Now come along!

 
 Michael:

 But it's my tuppence!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael, I will not permit you to throw your money away! When we get to the bank, I shall show you what may be done with your tuppence. And I think you'll find it extremely interesting.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Hello, Banks. What's all this about?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 These are my children, Mr. Dawes.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Well, so I assumed. But why are they here?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 They wish to open an account, sir.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Oh, indeed?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 And just how much money do you have, young man?

 
 Michael:

 Tuppence. But I want it to feed the birds.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Tuppence? Tuppence? Precisely how I started.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 That's the chairman of the bank, the elder Mr. Dawes. A giant in the world of finance.

 
 Michael:

 A giant?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Shh, shh, shh.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Uh, Father, these are Banks's children. They want to open an account.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Oh, they do, do they, boy? Excellent. Excellent. We can al-always use, al-always use more money to, to put to work for the bank, can't we, boy?

 So, you have tuppence? May I be permitted to see it?

 
 Michael:

 No. I want it to feed the birds!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Fiddlesticks, boy! Feed the birds and what have you got? Fat birds!

 But if you invest your tuppence

 Wisely in the bank

 Safe and sound

 Soon that tuppence safely invested in the bank

 Will compound

 And you'll achieve that sense of conquest

 As your affluence expands

 In the hands of the directors

 Who invest as propriety demands

 
 Mr. Banks:

 May I, sir?

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Carry on, Banks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You see, Michael, you'll be part of...

 Railways through Africa

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Exactly!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Dams across the Nile

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 The ships. Tell them about the ships.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Fleets of ocean Greyhounds

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 More, tell them more!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Majestic self-amortizing canals

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Oh, it fires the imagination!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Plantations of ripening tea all from

 
 Bank Directors:

 Tuppence prudently thriftily, frugally

 Invested in the

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 To be specific

 
 Bank Directors:

 In the Dawes, Tomes Mousley, Grubbs, Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Very well, my boy, give me the money.

 
 Michael:

 No, I won't! I want it to feed the birds.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Banks!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, sir. Now, Michael.

 When you deposit tuppence in a bank account

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Go on!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Soon you'll see

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Tell him more!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 That it blooms into credit of a generous amount semi-annually

 
 Bank Directors:

 And you'll achieve that sense of stature

 As your influence expands

 To the high financial strata

 That established credit now commands

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr) & Directors::

 You can purchase first and second trust deeds. Think of the foreclosures! Bonds, chattels, dividends, shares. Bankruptcies. Debtor sales. Opportunities. All manner of private enterprise. Shipyards. The mercantile. Collieries. Tanneries. Corporations. Amalgamations.

 Banks!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 While stand the banks of England, England stands. Oh, oh, oh, oh! When fall the banks of England, England falls!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You see, Michael? All for the lack of...

 
 Bank Directors:

 Tuppence patiently, cautiously trustingly invested in the

 To be specific in the Dawes, Tomes, Mousley, Grubbs, Fidelity Fiduciary Bank

 

 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Welcome to our joyful family of investors.

 
 Michael:

 Give it back! Gimme back my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael, behave.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Banks!

 
 Michael:

 Give it to me!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael, behave.

 
 Michael:

 Jane! Jane! Gimme back my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane! Michael! Michael! Michael!

 
 Michael:

 Gimme back my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael!

 
 Client 1:

 There's something wrong. The bank won't give someone their money!

 
 Client 2:

 Well, I'm going to get mine! Come along, young man! I want every penny!

 
 Client 3:

 And mine, too!

 
 Client 4:

 And give me mine, too!

 
 Banker:

 Stop all payments. Stop all payments.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Michael! Jane!

 
 Michael:

 Give me my money!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Children, come back here.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Stop those children.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane! Michael!

 
 Micheal:

 Gimme my money back! I want my money! Come on.

 
 Director:

 Stop those children! Stop those children!

 
 Old Woman:

 Come with me, my dears. Granny'll hide you!

 
 Bert:

 Here, here, half a mo.

 
 Michael:

 Leave her alone! Leave my sister alone!

 
 Bert:

 Easy, now. Your old friend ain't gonna hurt ya.

 
 Jane:

 Bert, it's you!

 
 Bert:

 In the flesh, and at your service.

 
 Michael:

 You're filthy!

 
 Bert:

 Oh, perhaps a smudge or two. It so happens that today I'm a chimney sweep.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, Bert, we're so frightened.

 
 Bert:

 Now, now, don't take on so. Bert'll take care of you like I was your own father. Now, who's after you?

 
 Jane:

 Father is.

 
 Bert:

 What?

 
 Michael:

 He brought us to see his bank.

 
 Bert:

 I don't know what we did, but it must've been something dreadful.

 
 Michael:

 He sent the police after us, and the army and everything.

 
 Jane:

 Michael, don't exaggerate.

 
 Bert:

 Well, now, there must be some mistake. Your dad's a fine gentleman and he loves ya!

 
 Jane:

 I don't think so. You should've seen the look on his face.

 
 Michael:

 He doesn't like us at all.

 
 Bert:

 Well, now that don't seem likely, does it?

 
 Jane:

 It's true.

 
 Bert:

 Let's sit down. You know, begging your pardon, but the one my heart goes out to is your father. There he is in that cold, heartless bank day after day, hemmed in by mounds of cold, heartless money. I don't like to see any living thing caged up.

 
 Jane:

 Father in a cage?

 
 Bert:

 They makes cages in all sizes and shapes, you know. Bank-shaped some of 'em, carpets and all.

 
 Jane:

 Father's not in trouble. We are.

 
 Bert:

 Oh, sure about that, are you? Look at it this way. You've got your mother to look after you. And Mary Poppins, and Constable Jones and me. Who looks after your father? Tell me that. When something terrible happens, what does he do? Fends for himself, he does. Who does he tell about it? No one! Don't blab his troubles at home. He just pushes on at his job, uncomplaining and alone and silent.

 
 Michael:

 He's not very silent!

 
 Jane:

 Michael, be quiet. Bert, do you think Father really needs our help?

 
 Bert:

 Well, not my place to say. I only observe that a father can always do with a bit of help. Come on, I'll take you home.

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

 A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

 Or blow me a kiss and that's lucky too

 Now as the ladder of life has been strung

 You might think a sweep's on the bottommost rung

 Though I spends me time in the ashes and smoke

 In this whole wide world there's no happier bloke

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

 A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

 
 Bert & Children:

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheree

 A sweep is as lucky as lucky can be

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim chim cheroo

 Good luck will rub off when I shakes hands with you

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, Ellen, see who that is, and send them away. I'm dreadfully late!

 
 Ellen:

 Yes, ma'am.

 
 Bert:

 Well, I'll be gettin' along now.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, please stay 'til father comes home. He'll feel much better if you shake hands with him.

 
 Ellen:

 It's the children, ma'am.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, I thought they were with their father. You haven't been running off again, have you? You know how terribly it upsets me.

 
 Bert:

 Oh, they haven't exactly been running away, ma'am. They have had bit of a fright, though. Need someone to look after 'em.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, of course! Mary Poppins will. Oh, no, it's her day off! Ellen, I wonder if you would--

 
 Ellen:

 No, ma'am. I haven't done me brasses yet.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Well, will you ask Mrs. Brill?

 
 Ellen:

 Not for a hundred quid, ma'am. This here is baking day, and you know how cook is!

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 What about you, sir? You've been so kind in looking after the children.

 
 Bert:

 Wh-- uh, me, ma'am? W-well, well, I-I-I have to be moving along. The Lord Mayor's got a stopped-up chimney.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Chimney. How clever of you to know. Our drawing room chimney's in the most ghastly condition. Smokes incessantly.

 
 Bert:

 W-w--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Thank you so much!

 
 Bert:

 But--

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Besides, it'll amuse the children.

 
 Bert:

 The Lord Mayor's gonna be terrible put out.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Oh, thank you so much. I do appreciate it. I must hurry. Our gallant ladies in prison are waiting for me to lead them in song! Good-bye, my darlings. See you soon.

 
 Bert:

 I choose me bristles with pride, yes, I do

 A broom for the shaft

 And a brush for the flue

 
 Jane:

 Oh, it's awfully dark and gloomy up there.

 
 Bert:

 There now. You see how wrong people can be? That there is what you might call a doorway to a place of enchantment.

 Up where the smoke is all billowed and curled

 'Tween pavement and stars

 Is the chimney sweep world

 When there's hardly no day

 Nor hardly no night

 There's things half in shadow

 And halfway in light

 On the rooftops of London

 Coo, what a sight.

 
 Jane:

 I do wish we could go up there.

 
 Michael:

 So do I! I like chimneys.

 
 Bert:

 Oh, rightly so! A chimney is a wondrous thing. She's built tall right up there on the roof. When the wind is just right, it blows across her top, then draws the smoke right up the flue. Here. Feel the pull on the end of that brush. It's like I got a whale on the end of the line, ain't it? Michael,

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Be careful. You never know what may happen around a fireplace. Oh, bother!

 
 Jane:

 Michael! Michael, come back down here. Michael! Michael, where are you?

 
 Bert:

 Well, that's a bit awkward. I must say!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Bert, I'll thank you to stop putting ideas in their heads! There goes the other one.

 
 Bert:

 Shall I go after 'em?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Well, we can't have them gallivanting up there like kangaroos, can we?

 
 Jane:

 Michael, don't be frightened. Everything's going--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Will you put your things on at once? Hurry up, please. Spit spot!

 
 Bert:

 Here you are! I thought you'd left us.

 
 Jane:

 We didn't mean to.

 
 Bert:

 Well, no harm done. The truth is, this is what you might call a fortuitous circumstance. Look there. A trackless jungle just waiting to be explored. Why not, Mary Poppins?

 
 Jane:

 Oh, please, Mary Poppins?

 
 Michael:

 Please!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, well. If we must, we must. Fall in. Look lively, look lively. Jump to it! Jump to it! Get in line. Attention! A-show arms! A-right turn! Quick march!

 
 Michael:

 Hello there!

 
 Bert:

 It's just good, clean soot, Michael.

 
 Bert:

 As far as we go, right?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Not at all.

 
 Bert:

 What did I tell ya? There's the whole world at your feet. And who gets to see it, but the birds, the stars and the chimney sweeps?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Quite nice, but we should all get in out of the night air. Follow me, please.

 Chim chiminy, chim chiminy chim

 Chim cheree when you're with a sweep you're in glad company

 
 Bert:

 Nowhere is there a more happier crew

 
 Bert & Mary Poppins:

 Chimney Sweeps:

 Admiral Boom:

 We're being attacked by Hottentots!

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Cheeky devils! Give 'em what for! Empty the shot lockers!

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Aye, aye, sir!

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Move along, Mr. Binnacle. Handsomely now. Teach the beggars a lesson.

 
 Mr. Binnacle:

 Gun ready, sir.

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Stand by. Fire!

 Fire! Well hit, sir! Very well hit!

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 Aah! They're at it again!

 
 Chimney Sweeps:

 Mrs. Banks:

 Good luck, guv'nor. Lovely time! Had an elegant time, guv'nor.

 
 Michael:

 Good luck, guv'nor.

 
 Jane:

 Oh, father, every one of those sweeps shook your hand. You're going to be the luckiest person in the world!

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Come along, children. Spit spot.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Just a moment, Mary Poppins. What is the meaning of this outrage?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I beg your pardon?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Will you be good enough to explain all this?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 First of all, I would like to make one thing quite clear.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 I never explain anything.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes. Banks here. Mr. Dawes! I'm most dreadfully sorry, sir, about what happened at the bank today. I can assure you that-- tonight, sir?

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Yes, Banks. We'll expect you at 9:00 precisely.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Without fail.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Without fail.

 
 Why, yes, Banks. It's extremely serious.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 We regret this course of action.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 We regret this course of action.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 After all, you have been with us a good many years.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 After all, you have been with us a good many years.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 As was your father before you.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 As was your father before you.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, Mr. Dawes. I shall be there at 9:00.

 A man has dreams of walking with giants.

 To carve his niche in the edifice of time.

 Before the mortar of his zeal

 Has a chance to congeal

 The cup is dashed from his lips!

 The flame is snuffed a-borning.

 He's brought to wrack and ruin in his prime.

 
 Bert:

 Life is a rum go, guv'nor, and that's the truth.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You know what I think? It's that woman Mary Poppins. From the moment she stepped into this house, things began to happen to me!

 
 Bert:

 Mary Poppins?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, yes, of course.

 My world was calm, well-ordered, exemplary.

 Then came this person with chaos in her wake

 And now my life's ambitions go

 With one fell blow

 It's quite a bitter pill to take.

 It's that Poppins woman! She did it!

 
 Bert:

 I know the very person you mean. Mary Poppins. She's the one what sings...

 A spoonful of sugar that is all it takes

 It changes bread and water into tea and cakes

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You see? That's exactly what I mean! Changing bread and water into tea and cakes!

 
 Bert:

 Indeed!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 No wonder everything's higgledy-piggledy here.

 
 Bert:

 A spoonful of sugar goes a long, long way

 Have yourself a healthy helpin' everyday

 An healthy helpin' of trouble, if you ask me.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Do you know what she did? I realize it now. She tricked me into taking Jane and Michael to the bank. That's how all the trouble started.

 
 Bert:

 Tricked you into taking the children on an outing?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes.

 
 Bert:

 Outrageous! A man with all the important things you have to do. Shameful! You're a man of high position. Esteemed by your peers.

 And when your little tykes are cryin' you haven't time to dry their tears

 and see them grateful little faces smilin' up at you

 because their dad he always knows just what to do

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well I mean, look, I, I don't think I ca-- -

 
 Bert:

 Like you say, guv'nor.

 You've got to grind, grind, grind at that grindstone

 Though childhood slips like sand through a sieve

 And all too soon they've up and grown

 And then they've flown

 And it's too late for you to give

 Just that spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Medicine go down

 Well, good-bye, guv'nor. Sorry to have troubled you.

 
 Jane:

 Father? We're sorry about the tuppence. We didn't know it would cause you so much trouble.

 
 Michael:

 Here, father, you can have the tuppence.

 
 Jane:

 Will that make everything all right?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Come in!

 Take your hat off, Banks.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Good evening, gentlemen.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Well, get on with it. Go on.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Uh, yes, Father. In 1773, an official of this bank, unwisely loaned a large sum of money, to finance a shipment of tea to the American colonies. Do you know what happened?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes, sir. Yes, I think I do. Uh, uh, as the ship lay in Boston harbor, uh, a party of the colonists dressed as Red Indians, uh, boarded the vessel, behaved very rudely, and, and threw all the tea overboard. This made the tea unsuitable for drinking, even for Americans.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Precisely. The loan was defaulted. Panic ensued within these walls. There was a run on the bank!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 From that time to this, sir, there has not been a run on this bank until today! A run, sir, caused by the disgraceful conduct of your son. Do you deny it?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I do not deny it, sir. And I shall be only too glad to assume responsibility for my son.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 What are you waiting for? Get on with it!

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Uh, y-yes, Father.

 
 Director 1:

 No, not that!

 
 Director 2:

 Steady on.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Well, do you have anything to say, Banks?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Well, sir, they do say that when there's nothing to say, all you can say I-

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Confound it, Banks! I said, do you have anything to say?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Just one word, sir.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Yes?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 What?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious. Mary Poppins was right. It's extraordinary. It does make you feel better!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 What are you talking about, man? There's no such word.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh, yes. It is a word. A perfectly good word, actually. Do you know what there's no such thing as? It turns out, with due respect, when all is said and done, that there's no such thing as you!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Impertinence, sir!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Speaking of impertinence, would you like to hear a perfectly marvelous joke? A real snapper!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Joke? Snapper?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Yes. There are these two wonderful young people, Jane and Michael. And they meet one day on the street, and Jane says to Michael, "I know a man with a wooden leg named Smith." and Michael says, "Really? What's the name of his other leg?"

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 The man's gone mad. Call the guard!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious. I'm feeling better all the time!

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Banks, don't you dare strike my father!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 There's the tuppence. The wonderful, fateful, Supercalifragilistic- expialidocious tuppence. Guard it well. Good-bye!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Banks, where are you going?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I don't know. I might pop through a chalk pavement picture, and go for an outing in the country. Or I might seize a horse off a merry-go-round, and win the derby! Or I might just fly a kite! Only Poppins would know!

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 Poppins?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 My nanny. She's the one who sings that ridiculous song.

 A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 The medicine--

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Mad as a march hare.

 
 Mr. Dawes (Snr):

 A wooden leg named Smith. A wooden leg named Smith. A wooden le--

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Father? Father! Father, come down! Daddy! Daddy, come back!

 
 Admiral Boom:

 Wind's come around, blowing dead on from the west!

 
 Michael:

 She doesn't care what happens to us.

 
 Jane:

 She only promised to stay 'til the wind changed. Isn't that right, Mary Poppins?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Will you bring me my hat stand, please?

 
 Jane:

 Mary Poppins, don't you love us?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 And what would happen to me, may I ask, if I loved all the children I said good-bye to?

 
 Constable:

 Yes, sir, that's right. George W. Banks. 17 Cherry Tree Lane. About six foot one, I'd say, sir. Oh, yes, we rang up his bank first thing this morning. The only thing we discovered was, he'd been discharged last night. No telling what he might do in a fit of despondency.

 
 Ellen:

 Wouldn't hurt to have them drag the river. There's a nice spot there by Suffolk bridge. Popular with jumpers.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Really, Ellen!

 
 Constable:

 He seemed to have been a fine, stable gentleman, sir. No hanky-panky, if you know what I mean. Oh, regular habits, sir. Well, far as anyone knows.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The medicine go down

 The medicine go down

 Just a spoonful of sugar

 
 Mrs. Brill:

 It's him!

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Helps the medicine go down

 
 Ellen:

 Or something that sounds like him.

 
 Constable:

 Mrs. Banks, could we have a little less noise on the premises? I can't make out what the inspector's sayin'.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 In the most delightful way

 Just a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George! Oh, George, you didn't jump in the river. How sensible of you.

 
 Constable:

 It's all right, sir. He's been found! No, alive! Or so I presume. He's a-kissin' a-Mrs. Banks.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 I've been so worried. What happened at the bank?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 I've been sacked, discharged, flung into the street.

 A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down

 
 Ellen:

 Gone off his crumpet. That's what he's done.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 The medicine go down

 
 Ellen:

 Dotty as you please.

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 George, what on earth were you doing in the cellar?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 You'll see in a moment. Where are the children? Jane? Michael?

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 Your father's calling you.

 
 Michael:

 It doesn't sound like Father.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Jane? Michael?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Run along. Spit spot!

 
 Michael:

 You won't go, Mary Poppins, will you?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Spit spot.

 
 Michael:

 He mended it!

 
 Jane:

 It's wonderful! However did you manage it?

 
 Mr. Banks:

 With tuppence for paper and strings

 You can have your own set of wings

 With your feet on the ground

 You're a bird in flight

 With your fist holding tight

 To the string of your kite

 Oh, oh, oh

 Let's go fly a kite

 Up to the highest height

 Let's go fly a kite

 And send it soaring

 Up through the atmosphere

 Up where the air is clear

 Oh, let's go fly a kite

 
 Mrs. Banks:

 A proper kite needs a proper tail, don't you think?

 
 Constable:

 That's what I said, sir. Go fly a kite! Oh, no, sir. No, I, I don't mean you personally.

 
 Banks Family:

 Let's go fly a kite

 Up to the highest height

 Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring

 Up through the atmosphere

 Up where the air is clear

 Oh, let's go fly a kite

 
 Bert:

 When you send it flying up there

 All at once you're lighter than air

 You can dance on the breeze

 Over houses and trees

 With your fist holding tight

 To the string of your kite

 
 Kite Flyers:

 Oh, oh, oh 

 
 Michael:

 Now!

 
 Kite Flyers:

 Let's go fly a kite

 Up to the highest height

 Let's go fly a kite and send it soaring

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Oh, there you are, Banks. I want to congratulate you. Capital bit of humor. Wooden leg named Smith. Or Jones or whatever it was. Father died laughing.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

 
 Mr. Dawes:

 Oh, no, nonsense. Nothing to be sorry about. Never seen him happier in his life. He left an opening for a new partner. Congratulations.

 
 Mr. Banks:

 Thank you, sir. Thank you very much indeed, sir.

 
 Kite Flyers:

 Up through the atmosphere

 Up where the air is clear

 Oh, let's go fly a kite

 
 Umbrella:

 That's gratitude for you. Didn't even say good-bye.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 No, they didn't.

 
 Umbrella:

 Look at them. You know, they think more of their father than they do of you.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 That's as it should be.

 
 Umbrella:

 Well, don't you care?

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Practically perfect people never permit sentiment to muddle their thinking.

 
 Umbrella:

 Is that so? Well, I'll tell you one thing, Mary Poppins, you don't fool me a bit.

 
 Mary Poppins:

 Oh, really?

 
 Umbrella:

 Yes, really. I know exactly how you feel about these children. And if you think I'm gonna keep my mouth shut any longer, I--

 
 Mary Poppins:

 That will be quite enough of that, thank you.

 
 Bert:

 Good-bye, Mary Poppins. Don't stay away too long.

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an
insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides
effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.

The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS
unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down
the road.

INT. VAN -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

The DRIVER of the van, a fifty-year-old American, turns on the wipers,
smearing the remains all over.

				DRIVER
		Goddamn bugs.

He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but
now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight
of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.

He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He
speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled.

				DRIVER (CONT'D)
		Deja me hablar.
			(Let me do the talking.)

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue
four doors with "INS" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS
stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward
and comes to the window.

The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also
government issue, looks at him and sighs.

				AGENT JANUS
		Well. Nick the Dick. What a surprise. Where
		you comin' from?

				DRIVER
		I was fishing in Cuernavaca.

				AGENT JANUS
		Sure you were. What do you say we have a
		look at your catch?

AT THE BACK OF THE VAN,

the Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED
MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus
looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his
head.

				AGENT JANUS
		Me, I woulda thrown 'em back.
			(to the passengers, in Spanish)
		Vamanos. Fuera. Hagan una lina!
			(Let's go. Out. Form a line!)

They pile out of the van. Some are parents with small children.

				AGENT JANUS (CONT'D)
		What do you get, Nick? Hundred bucks a
		head?  Two hundred? I hope you saved it all
		for your lawyer, pal, 'cause you're gonna
		need --

He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching,
fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several
Agents pull their weapons.

The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS
cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their
headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.

TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple
black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of
world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach
the INS agents.

				KAY
		We'll take it from here.

				AGENT JANUS
		Who the hell are you?

Kay and Dee flash some form of ID.

				KAY
		INS Division 6.

				AGENT JANUS
		Division 6? I never heard of Division 6.

				KAY
		Really?

Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		What're we thinking, Dee?

				DEE
		Tough call, Kay.

He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in
Spanish.

				KAY
		!Oye! Que pasa, coma estas? Hey!
			(What's up, how are you?)
		No se preocupe, abuela. Bienvenida a los
		Estados Unidos.
			(Don't worry grandma.
			Welcome to the United
			States.)
				(next)
		A donde vas? San Antonio? Buscando trabajo,
		no? Buena suerta.
			(Where are you going? San
			Antonio?  Looking for
			work, aren't you?  Good
			luck.)
				(next)
		Es un placer verle aqui.
			(It's a pleasure seeing
			you here.)

One by one, their faces relax, reassured by Kay's calm demeanor. When he
reaches the fifth Guy, he keeps the same cheery tone, but:

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Que dices si te rompo la cara?
			(What do you say if I
			break your face?)

The Guy smiles and nods. Kay stops. His own smile broadens and he drops a
hand on the Guy's shoulder.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		No hablas ni una palabra del Espanol,
		verdad, amigo?
			(You don't speak a word
			of Spanish, right, friend?)

Again, the Guy smiles and nods. Kay looks back at Dee.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		We got a winner.
			(to the others)
		Los restos estan libres a irse. Largense!
			(The rest of you are free
			to go. Scram!)

				AGENT JANUS
		Sir!

				KAY
		Tomen el camion, y vayeuse.
			(Get on the road and go.)

				AGENT JANUS
		Sir, you can't just --

				KAY
		Don't "Sir" me! You have no idea who you're
		dealing with!

Silence on the road. The Driver grins, jumps back in the front seat of the
van. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there.

				KAY (CONT'D)
			(to Janus)
		We're gonna have a little chat with our
		friend here. You boys can hit the road ...
		and keep on protecting us from dangerous
		aliens.

Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise,
leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway.

				AGENT JANUS
		You ever heard of Division 6?

				2ND INS AGENT
		There is no Division 6.

				3RD INS AGENT
		Who are those guys?

EXT. DESERT CLEARING - NIGHT

Kay and Dee lead their captive into a clearing in the desert brush. Dee
pulls an enormous handgun from a shoulder holster and stays a pace or two
off, covering him. Kay has an arm draped around the man's shoulders.

				KAY
		I think you jumped off the bus in the wrong
		part of town, amigo. In fact, I'll bet
		dollars to pesos that you're not --

He pulls out a small laser device, which he ZIPS neatly down the front of
the man's clothes.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		-- from anywhere near here.

The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is
underneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with
a snouth, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at
the top of his head.

The only part of his camouflage not crumpled to the ground is the
humanesque "head," which he still lamely holds in one of his hands. It's
propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions
as he holds it.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Mikey?! When did they let you out of jail?

MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and
saliva.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Political refugee. Right.

				DEE
		You know how many treaty articles you've
		just violated?

Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK.

				KAY
		One, my ass. Try seven.

				DEE
		From unauthorized immigration to failure to
		properly inoculate prior to landing.

				KAY
			(off Mikey's objections)
		Okay, that's enough. Hand me your head and
		put up your arms.

From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP.

Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall
stalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just
over the rise, staring in frozen amazement.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Ah, shit.

Agent Janus SCREAMS. Mikey rips free of the rest of the "Mexican"
disguise, knocks Dee out of the way, and takes off straight at Janus,
SCREECHING a horrible Space Bastard screech. Janus freezes, terrified.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Dee! Shoot him!

Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell
out of his hand as he hit the ground.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Dee, for Christ's --

Mikey keeps moving, covering the last few yards to Janus quickly. He steps
on a rock, launches himself into the air, his dripping jaws cranked wide
open --

-- there is a SIZZLING sound, a brilliant white flash --

-- and Mikey ERUPTS in a geyser of blue goo that splatters all over the
ground, the trees, and Agent Janus' face. Behind where Mikey was, Kay
stands, smoking weapon in hand.

EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT

On the road, the INS AGENTS pull their guns and run toward the rise.

EXT. DESERT CLEARING -- NIGHT

Kay has an arm around Janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing.
Janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.

				AGENT JANUS
		Th -- th -- th --

				KAY
			(helping)
		"That."

				AGENT JANUS
		That wasn't -- wasn't -- wasn't --

				KAY
		Human, I know. Oops. Got some entrails on
		you.

He takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the Agent's face. As he does,
Janus looks back to where Mikey blew up. Then at Kay. And then up at the
stars.

The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions.

				KAY
		Okay, everybody, situation's under control,
		calm down. If you'll just give me your
		attention for a moment I'll tell you what
		happened.

From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start
to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular
metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. He checks his watch,
figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the
device up to "08."

				KAY (CONT'D)
		This is called a "neuralyzer." A gift from
		some friends from out of town. The red eye
		here isolates and measures the electronic
		impulses in your brain. More specifically,
		the ones for memory.

Behind him, six more MEN IN BLACK, all wearing black suits and sunglasses,
come over the hill. Kay barks a few orders to them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please;
		holes at 40, 60, and 80.

				2ND INS AGENT
		What in the hell is going on?!

				KAY
		Exactly the right question. And the answer
		lies right -- here. Pay attention.

				JANUS
		Who are you, really?

				KAY
		Really? I'm just a figment of your
		imagination.

He holds up the neuralyzer. The Agents peer closely at it.  Kay reaches
into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses --

-- and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer.  A BLINDING FLASH a
tenth of a second long sears the Agents' eyeballs. They stare blankly.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		God, we're a gullible breed.

Behind him, TONGUES OF FIRE blast from a flame thrower held by one of the
Men in Black. Kay looks back at the INS Agents, who are just coming
around, as if awakening from a concussion.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		I mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be
		alive after a blast like that.

The Agents look around, confused.

				AGENT JANUS
		What -- blast?

Kay gestures behind him, where the Men in Black are now using fire
extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.

				KAY
		Underground gas vein, genius. You guys need
		to exercise more caution before discharging
		your firearms.

He jabs a finger into Janus' chest.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Especially you.

Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at
the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away
from the group and finds him. He sits down next to him.

				DEE
		I'm sorry. About...back there.

				KAY
		Happens.

				DEE
		Didn't used to.

He holds up his hands, which tremble with age.

				DEE (CONT'D)
		The spirit's willing, Kay, but the rest of
		me...

He looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.

				DEE (CONT'D)
		They're beautiful, aren't they?

				KAY
		What?

				DEE
		The stars. We never just -- look. Anymore.
			(back to Kay)
		I'll tell ya, Kay. I will miss the chase.

Kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.

				KAY
		No. You won't.

EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION -- SOUTHERN EXPOSURE -- NIGHT

A shot of the clock on the Station's stately southern exposure. WE PAN
DOWN TO...

A pair of feet running. They belong to a man we will know as the
PERPETRATOR. As we track with him, he SPEEDS UP and OUT OF FRAME.

A new set of feet come into frame. These belong to JAMES EDWARDS, a NYC
COP in undercover street clothes. In the BACKGROUND, about ten feet
behind, are two other cops, trying to keep up.

Edwards is a lot faster, though. He pulls out his badge that hangs from a
chain under his shirt.

				EDWARDS
		Stop! NYPD!

He continues running, out of frame, and we stay on one of the other COPS,
overweight, who gives up the chase and drops to his knees, heaving air.

				COP
		All yours, Edwards!

The Cop fumbles in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes.

TRACK WITH EDWARDS AND THE PERP

As they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low Forties.
The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's
a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail, and drops to Forty-first
Street below.

EDWARDS is surprised by this maneuver, but doesn't waste a second. He,
too, hurdles the guard rail and lands on...

EXT. 41ST STREET AND PARK AVENUE - NIGHT

A DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown
traffic. The bus, of course, is completely filled with JAPANESE TOURISTS,
and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera.

EDWARDS pushes through the crowd...

				EDWARDS
		Grand Central Station off to your left,
		folks...

With the bus still moving, he scrambles down the circular stairs and runs
out through the side door.

He spots the Perp, sailing east on Forty-first Street.

				EDWARDS
		Dammit, man, you're making me sweat up my
		gear!

Edwards spots one of those New York Post delivery trucks, the kind with
the open back door, rumbling by.  He runs and jumps into the back.

EXT. FIFTH AVENUE -- NIGHT

THE PERP, meanwhile, is running at top speed, when Edwards glides into
frame, leaning off the back of the truck.

				EDWARDS
		Yo, man, your luck just ran out.

He leaps from the back of the moving truck and tackles the Perp.

The Perp, now straddled by Edwards, is terrified.

				PERP
		He's coming! He's coming!

				EDWARDS
		And when he gets here, I'll kick his ass
		too.

Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the Perp blinks. Nothing
unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white
eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also.

Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to
pull out...

His WEAPON, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting
quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand.

THE WEAPON smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and
SHATTERS into a million pieces.

				EDWARDS
		What the...

WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and
takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain.

The Perp leaps over a moving car, towards the GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM. Edwards
tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the
Perp is gone.

EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- NIGHT

Edwards runs over to the Museum, leans over the wall that surrounds it,
and in the next instant...

The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of
the Guggenheim. He scrambles up and over the ledge.

Edward reacts. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open and
runs inside.

He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim.

EXT. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM -- ROOF -- NIGHT

On the roof, the PERP reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and CRUNCHES
to the gravel surface. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's
locked.

He tugs on another. It's locked too. He pulls on a third. It swings open --

-- revealing EDWARDS on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon
at the Perp.

				EDWARDS
		Wassup?

The Perp SCREAMS inhumanly and panics. He backpedals, toward the edge of
the roof.

				PERP
		He's coming! He's coming because I failed,
		and now he'll kill me too!

				EDWARDS
		Stop!

				PERP
		You don't understand. Your world is gonna
		end.

But the Perp has backed right into the edge of the roof, and now he starts
to fall over. The Perp blinks.

				EDWARDS
		What are you?!

The Perp looks down. He decides.

-- and he falls, SCREAMING, to his death.

								CUT TO:

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT

EDWARDS sits on one side of the table, a POLICE INSPECTOR and a UNIFORMED
SERGEANT (the one who gave up the chase and lit a cigarette earlier), sit
across from him.

				INSPECTOR
		Perpetrator then blinked two sets of
		eyelids. You mean blinked with both eyes?

				EDWARDS
		No, sir. He blinked once with one set, then
		again with another completely different set.

				SERGEANT
		Sort of a low beam, high beam.

				INSPECTOR
		Was that before or after he drew the weapon
		which you claim evaporated into a million
		pieces?

				EDWARDS
		After, sir.

				INSPECTOR
		And why do you suppose none of the other
		officers saw either of these two events?

				EDWARDS
		'Cause some of the other officers are a
		little soggy in the midsection. And they
		couldn't keep up, sir.

				SERGEANT
		Hey, Edwards, if you were half the man I
		am --

				EDWARDS
		What do you mean? I am half the man you are.

				SERGEANT
		What the hell is your problem?

				EDWARDS
		My problem is you being all up in my damn
		face all the time.

				SERGEANT
		I think he threw him off the roof. Ten
		minutes -- your best shot.

				INSPECTOR
			(cutting off the Sergeant)
		Sergeant. I want to talk to you outside.
		Now.

				EDWARDS
		You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster, you
		pudgy bastard.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT

A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish,
dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above
him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and
saw a spaceman (which she did).  She looks over her shoulder once, then
whispers to him.

				LAUREL
		Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I
		believe you. I opened him up. Find me at
		the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I
		found.

				EDWARDS
		Hey...Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

				LAUREL
			(turning at the door)
		You have really pretty eyes.

She hurries to turn the corner, but is STOPPED by someone who remains just
offscreen.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office?
		Working on the John Doe?

Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel,
facing whoever it is in the hallway.

				LAUREL
		Yes. That's right.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Would you look right here, please.

The Someone says something else and Laurel steps forward, now also out of
Edwards's line of vision.

				LAUREL (O.S.)
		Look where?

Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH
from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up --

-- when KAY steps into the room and closes the door behind him. Edwards
rolls his eyes.

				KAY
		Some night, huh?

				EDWARDS
		Oh, yeah, some night.

He crosses to the door.

				KAY
		They were gills.

Edwards stops.

				KAY
		Not eyelids.

				EDWARDS
		Who are you?

				KAY
		Did he say anything to you?

				EDWARDS
			(scoffing)
		Yeah, sure. He said the world was coming to
		an end.

				KAY
		Did he say when?

				EDWARDS
		You're kidding, right?

				KAY
		Would you recognize his weapon if you saw
		it again?

				EDWARDS
		Absolutely.

				KAY
		Let's take a ride.

				EDWARDS
		Wait a minute. I got a ton of paperwork.

				KAY
		It's all done.

At that point, the INSPECTOR sticks his head in, smiles and gives Edwards
the thumbs up.

				INSPECTOR
		Good work, Edwards.

Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. As they leave.

				KAY
		You ran that guy down on foot? That's tough.
		That's double tough.

								CUT TO:

INT. FORD LTD - A MOMENT LATER - DRIVING

In a plain, boxy Ford, Kay drives, silent. He raises his hand and nods to
a black MIB truck coming in the opposite direction.Edwards, in the
passenger seat, is still in his undercover outfit.

				EDWARDS
		So who you with?

Kay says nothing.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		You got the plain clothes, the
		government-issued wheels. Secret Service?
		CIA?

Kay remains utterly silent.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
			(referring to the car)
		Yeah, well, whoever it is, you're short on
		funding.

				KAY
		Nothing is what it seems, kid.

				EDWARDS
		Oh, yeah, my bad '86 Ford LTD. That's a
		luxury ride. C'mon, who ya with?

Kay pulls the car to a stop.

				KAY
		I'm part of a secret organization that
		monitors and polices alien activity on earth.

Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. Edwards follows.

EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

Edwards looks around. Sees they're standing in front of a PAWN SHOP.

				EDWARDS
		This is where we're going?

They get out of the car.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		Jack Jeebs? Guy buys from chain snatchers.
		Doesn't even sell guns.

				KAY
		Really?

				EDWARDS
		All right, you think it's worth shaking him
		up, fine. I'll do my thing. Then I want some
		answers.

				KAY
		Do your "thing," kid.  Edwards goes inside.

INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT

JACK JEEBS is the sleazy, sarcastic proprietor of the Pawn Shop. He's not
easily intimidated.

				JEEBS
		Officer Edwards. Oh, hey, geez, how'd these
		get here? I thought I turned 'em in to the
		proper authorities.

He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter.

				EDWARDS
		Way I hear it, Jeebs, you into something a
		little hotter than some stolen Rolexes.

				JEEBS
		Sure -- I'm a big crack dealer now. I just
		work here because I love the hours.

This pisses Edwards off. He grabs Jeebs by the collar.

				EDWARDS
			(getting angry)
		I'm talking about guns, Jeebs. High-tech
		stuff.

				JEEBS
		C'mon, Edwards, whatcha see is what I got.

				KAY (O.S.)
		Why don't you show him the imports, Jeebs.

At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming
over his face.

				JEEBS
		H-hiya Kay, how are you?

				KAY
		The imports, Jeebs. Now.

				JEEBS
		You know I got outta that business a long
		time ago, Kay.

				KAY
		Why do you lie to me? I hate it when you
		lie.

He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead.

				JEEBS
		Whoa, whoa, Kay, hold on a minute here...

				KAY
		I'm going to count to three.

Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine.

				EDWARDS
		He'll do it, Jeebs.

				KAY
		One.

				EDWARDS
		I've seen him do it.

				KAY
		Two.

				EDWARDS
		Talk to me, Jeebs, he's crazy when he's
		like this.

				JEEBS
		He's always crazy.
			(to Kay)
		Take a cruise. Get a massage --

				KAY
		Three.

KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor.
Edwards is shocked.

Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head.

				EDWARDS
		Put down the gun and put your hands on the
		counter!

				KAY
		I warned him.

				EDWARDS
		Drop the weapon!

				KAY
		You warned him.

				EDWARDS
		You are under arrest. You have the right to
		remain silent.

				KAY
		Will you relax?

				JEEBS (O.S.)
			(irritated)
		Don't do that.

Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes
four or five seconds. Kay calmly shoves his gun up against Jeebs'
baby-soft new cheek.

				JEEBS (CONT'D)
		Do you know how much that hurts?

				KAY
		Show us what you got, Jeebs. Or I'll use up
		another one.

Jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which
promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with
junk --

-- but this is all alien junk. Weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly
weapons of all shapes and sizes.

				KAY
		Edwards?

Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the
weapons.

				EDWARDS
		Uh, this. This is what I saw.

Kay looks at Jeebs, pissed off.

				KAY
		You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity
		to an unlicensed cephlapoid.

				JEEBS
		He looked all right to me.

				KAY
		A carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, Jeebs.
		Who was the target?

				JEEBS
		I don't know.

Kay raises the weapon again, threatening.

				KAY
		Jeebs!

				JEEBS
		I don't know!

Kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.

				KAY
		This is all confiscated. All of it. I want
		you on the next transport off this rock. Or
		I'll shoot you where it doesn't grow back.

Jeebs nods, point taken. Kay leaves.

				EDWARDS
		Yeah. I'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes.

Shaken, Edwards follows.

EXT. PAWN SHOP -- NIGHT

Edwards staggers out of the shop, trying to get the day's events straight
in his head.

				EDWARDS
		The eyelids, fine ... and the jumping thing
		... and the gun ... okay, but the head?

				KAY
		Searching for a handle on the moment here?
		A place to file all this.

				EDWARDS
		See a head doesn't do that, it doesn't just
		grow back.
			(looking up)
		What's going on?

				KAY
		Can't help you, kid. Only comfort I can
		offer is that tomorrow, you won't remember
		a thing.

				EDWARDS
		Oh, no. This I'm gonna remember for a long,
		long time.

Kay pulls the neuralyzer from his pocket. He hesitates for the briefest of
moments -- as if this particular neuralyzation is different than all the
others.

Then he puts on his sunglasses.

				KAY
		Ever see one of these?

								CUT TO:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

-- the flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese
restaurant.

				KAY
			(finishing a joke)
		-- and the wife says yeah, Harry, I know,
		but this one's eating my popcorn!

He busts out laughing. Edwards, across from him, is completely
disoriented. He looks down. There's a half-eaten order of broccoli beef
and several empty bottles of beer on the table in front of him.

				EDWARDS
		Huh?

Kay checks his watch.

				KAY
		Whoops. Gotta run. Thanks for the egg rolls.

				EDWARDS
		Where am I?

				KAY
		See what I mean about tequila? You're a
		bright young man, James. Just lay off the
		sauce. I'll see you tomorrow, nine a.m.
		sharp.

He turns and walks out. Edwards checks his watch. A WAITRESS appears.

				WAITRESS
		Another beer?

				EDWARDS
		Coffee. Please.

She walks off. Edwards looks at the table. There is a business card lying
next to his plate, on which Kay has handwritten "James D. Edwards,
Saturday, 9 a.m., 504 Battery Drive."

Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and looks at the
other side. There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no
e-mail address. Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:

				MIB

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm
country. Several lights are on and through a window we can see the
silhouette of a MAN sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a
WOMAN hovering over him, bringing things to him.

The Man (EDGAR) waves his arms, ranting.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I go out, I work my butt off to make a
		living, all I want is to come home to a
		nice clean house with a nice fat steak on
		the table, but instead I get this -- this
		-- I don't even know what you call this!

In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something
strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I'll tell you what it looks like, it looks
		like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm
		eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't
		it?!

No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes
from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way
into fruit metaphors.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		I swear to God, I would not be surprised if
		it was, the way you skulk around here like
		a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been
		hit enough, I can't make up my mind.

Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting
to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight
toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.

The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing
		that pulls its weight around here is my
		goddamn truck!

-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A
concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.

				EDGAR (O.S.)
		Stay here!

The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws
it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty,
bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he
walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck.
The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering
hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.

				EDGAR
		Figures.

He walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt
tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole.

IN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights.
Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across.

BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.

				BEATRICE
		What is it, Edgar?!

				EDGAR
			(turns to her)
		Get your big butt back in that house!

Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back
to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY
VOICE comes from deep in the hole.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Place projectile weapon on ground.

Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises
the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.

				EDGAR
		You can have my gun when you pry it from my
		cold, dead fingers!

There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it
responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Your proposal is acceptable.

A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and
pulls him down into the hole.

From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet
being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment
later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to
the truck.

It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face,
arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now
he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the
prom.

The shotgun flies out and lands beside him.

								CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears
from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the
kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind
him. He carries the shotgun.

She looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank.

				BEATRICE
		What on earth was it?!

He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than
before. More refined.

				EDGAR
		Sugar.

Pause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck.

				BEATRICE
		I've never seen sugar do that.

				EDGAR
		Give me sugar.

Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar.
She holds it out to him.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		In water.

Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of
the sugar into it.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		More.

She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a
knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.

Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no
idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.

				BEATRICE
		Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just
		hanging off your bones!

Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He
reaches up --

-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the
skin of his neck back into his shirt collar.  He looks at her.

				EDGAR
		That better?

Beatrice faints.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Stillness. Silence. A loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the
spaceship.

The nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving,
and finally CRUNCHES to the ground outside the pit.

EDGAR climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. He dusts himself off and
continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY

The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his
hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the
utterly nondescript building in front of him. It's seven stories high,
gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like
a fat guy on the john.
			   "504 Battery Drive."

INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY

EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre
room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel
vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an
OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding
metal chair halfway across.

Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.

				GUARD
		Help you?

				EDWARDS
		Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

				GUARD
		Elevator. Push the "call" button.

And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more
than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator.
As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY

Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. He pushes the
"call" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move. Instead, doors on
the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him. Edwards
waits, unaware.

From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and
finds himself standing in --

INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway.
Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an
old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last
night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at
Edwards.

One chair is empty.

				ZED
		You're late. Sit down.

Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed
continues addressing the Recruits.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		My name is Zed. You're all here because
		you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy
		SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		And we're looking for one of you. Just one.
		What will follow is a series of simple
		tests designed to quantify motor skills,
		hand-eye coordination, concentration,
		stamina -- I see we have a question.

Edwards's hand is, indeed, up.

				EDWARDS
		Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one
		really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are
		we doing this?

Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls
on him.

				ZED
		Son?

				AMBITIOUS RECRUIT
			(loud and formal)
		Jake Jensen, West Point, graduate with
		honors. We're here because you're looking
		for the best of the best of the best, sir!

Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't.

				ZED
		What's so funny, Edwards?

				EDWARDS
		I -- I don't know, sir. This guy. "Best of
		the best of the best of the best of the --"
			(realizing nobody is with
			him on this)
		It just struck me as --
			(totally serious)
		Humorous. Sir.

Short pause. Then Zed continues.

				ZED
		Okay. Let's get going.

INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY

The recruits scribble away at the written test. It's a thick document --
reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams.  The RECRUITS seem to be
really powering through it, filling in answer after answer.

But no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their
chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.

EDWARDS is really struggling. He writes two words on one answer, then
decides to erase it. The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy;
his pencil even TEARS through the page.

He looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table.
Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --

-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody
looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.

Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table.  That's better.

Zed raises an eyebrow. He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a
smoked glass window. Behind the dark glass, a FIGURE stands, staring,
unemotional.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY

SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty,
triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table.

There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each
other, at the blank walls...

				EDWARDS
		Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're
		doing here?

				MARINE
			(clipped, unquestioning)
		Looking for the best of the best of the best.

				EDWARDS
			(can't help but smile)
		Well, yeah, I know, but...

And then .. suddenly --

The two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is
suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both
human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic
mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously.

The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX
SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is
fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last.

There's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED
with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some
sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.

				ZED
		The hell happened?

				EDWARDS
		Hesitated, sir.

Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of
creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in
its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a
large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back
corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty
eight-year-old girl.

				ZED
		May I ask why you felt little Tiffany
		deserved to die?

				EDWARDS
		She was the only one who actually seemed
		dangerous. At the time.

				ZED
		And how did you come to that conclusion?

				EDWARDS
		Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can
		think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's
		not his head. His head is that butt-ugly
		bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you
		look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not
		snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues
		in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow,
		the girl's books were way too advanced for
		an eight-year-old's. And besides, from
		where I'm looking, she was the only one who
		appeared to have a motive. And I don't
		appreciate your jumping down my throat about
		it.

Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.

				EDWARDS (CONT'D)
		Or, uh -- do I owe her an apology?

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - OBSERVATION ROOM/INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are
still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.

				ZED
		He's got a real problem with authority.

				KAY
		So do I. The guy ran down a cephlapoid, Zed.
		On foot. Tenacity. That I can use.

				ZED
		I hope you know what you're doing.

Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who
stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.

Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and
into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		Congratulations, you're everything we've
		come to expect from years of government
		training. Now, if you'll just follow me, we
		have one more test to administer, an eye
		exam.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long
hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of
the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.

KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last
night.

				EDWARDS
		You! Hey, what's goin' on?

The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer,
just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does.

				KAY
		Back in the mid-fifties, the government
		started a little underfunded agency with
		the simple and laughable purpose of making
		contact with a race not of this planet.

As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have
been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from
his pocket.

				ZED
		Now, if you'll look directly at the end of
		this device.

He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare
obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.

Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away,
just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

As KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file
folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs.

He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black
suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and
fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger.

				KAY
		Everybody thought the agency was a joke.
		Except the aliens. They made contact on
		March 2nd, 1961, outside New  York City.

Another photograph, a grainy black and white image of two ships hovering
in the night sky -- classic flying saucer shapes.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		There were nine of us that night. Seven
		agents. An amateur astronomer. And one poor
		kid who got lost on the wrong back road.

Yet another photograph, this one showing a young KAY, in a shirt and tie,
holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed
flying saucer. ALIEN SHAPES are visible within.

				EDWARDS
		You brought the aliens flowers?

Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as
the first.

				KAY
		They were intergalactic refugees with a
		simple request. Let us use the earth as an
		apolitical zone for people without a
		planet.  Ever see "Casablanca?" Same thing,
		no Nazis.  We agreed. So we masked all
		evidence of their landing.

Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under
construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space
travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the
flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.

				EDWARDS
		The 1964 World's Fair was a coverup?

				KAY
		Why else would we hold it in Queens?
			(another hallway)
		Now left. More nonhumans arrive every year.
		They live among us, in secret.

				EDWARDS
		I see. Not to change the subject, but when
		was your last cat-scan?

				KAY
		Every six months; it's company policy.

				EDWARDS
		Well, thanks for the very amusing morning,
		but I'm hopin' you'll show me where I came
		in?  'Cause this is where I go out.

They have stopped next to an unmarked door. Kay throws it open and steps
inside.

				KAY
		Yeah, sure, hang on, I wanna grab a coffee
		while we're right here.

As Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and
he stares in wonderment --

-- at THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Tall,
impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an
animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of
Esperanto and microphone feedback.

				KAY (CONT'D)
			(to the aliens)
		Don't tell me we've only got that powdered
		shit for cream again?

One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to
the counter.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Oh.

He finds the cream sitting out on the counter where the alien indicated,
dumps some in his coffee, and comes back outside, closing the door behind
him. He reaches up and gently pushes Edwards' jaw up, closing his mouth.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		For future reference, this is a better look
		for you.

								CUT TO:

EXT. BATTERY PARK - DAY

EDWARDS, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside KAY on a
bench in Battery Park. Kay drinks his coffee while they talk.

				KAY
		Any given time, around fifteen hundred
		landed aliens are on the planet, the
		majority right here in Manhattan. Most
		aliens are decent enough, just trying to
		make a living.

				EDWARDS
		Cab drivers?

				KAY
		Not as many as you'd think. Humans, for the
		most part, don't have a clue. Don't want
		one, either. They're happy. They think
		they've got a pretty good bead on things.

				EDWARDS
		Why the big secret? People are smart, they
		can handle it.

				KAY
		A person is smart. People are dumb.
		Everything they've ever "known" has been
		proven to be wrong. A thousand years ago
		everybody knew as a fact, that the earth
		was the center of the universe. Five
		hundred years ago, they knew it was flat.
		Fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans
		were alone on it. Imagine what you'll know
		tomorrow.

				EDWARDS
		So what's the catch?

				KAY
		What you'll gain in perspective, you'll
		lose in ways you're too young to comprehend.
		You give up everything. Sever every human
		contact. No one will know you exist. Ever.

				EDWARDS
		Nobody?

				KAY
		You're not even allowed a favorite shirt.
		There.  That's the speech I never heard.
		That's the choice I never got.

				EDWARDS
		Hold up. You track me down, put me through
		those stupid-ass tests, now you're trying
		to talk me out of it. I don't get it.

				KAY
		You got 'til sun-up.

				EDWARDS
		Is it worth it?

				KAY
		You find out, you let me know.

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BATTERY PARK - DUSK

Almost nighttime now, and the park is empty. EDWARDS is still on the
bench. And still thinking. Above him, the stars are coming out.

Slowly, he looks up, into the vastness of the heavens.

							DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GARAGE - DAY

The next morning. A door opens on a garage and an ORKIN MAN steps inside,
carrying a tank of toxic gas. The morning light spills on an abundance of
spiders, crawling everywhere -- big ones, small ones, hundreds of them
have moved in and taken over this dusty place.

The Orkin Man sighs and sets down his tank.

				ORKIN MAN
		Well, well, well. Movin' right in, are we?
		Think we own the place?

He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank.

				ORKIN MAN (CONT'D)
		Got a little eviction notice for you, boys.

He raises a mask to his face and unscrews the handle on the top of the
tank. LETHAL GAS starts to HISS from the end of the hose.

				VOICE (O.S.)
		Just what exactly do you think you're doing?

The Orkin Man turns around. EDGAR stands in the doorway to the garage,
staring at him disdainfully.

				ORKIN MAN
			(shrugs)
		Takin' care of your pest problem.

				EDGAR
		"Pest" problem? "Pest?"

				ORKIN MAN
		Yeah. You got a hell of an infestation.

Edgar advances on him, slowly.

				EDGAR
		You know, I have noticed an infestation
		here. Everywhere I look, in fact. Nothing
		but undeveloped, unevolved, barely conscious
		pond scum. So convinced of their own
		superiority as they scurry about their
		short, pointless lives.

				ORKIN MAN
		Well -- yeah. Don't you want to get rid of
		'em?

				EDGAR
		In the worst way.

Edgar lashes out quickly, jerking the mask off the Orkin Man's face with
one hand --

-- and shoving the gas hose down his throat with the other.

THE ORKIN MAN'S CAR KEYS drop to the garage floor, and Edgar picks them
up.

EXT. GARAGE - DAY

A six-by-ten sheet of plywood THUDS to the driveway outside the garage.
EDGAR raises one end of it so it's hanging off the back end of the Orkin
man's van -- now it's a ramp.

He walks off and we hear that familiar SCRAPING sound again. Edgar,
GRUNTING with the effort, slowly pushes his spaceship up the ramp and into
the back of the Orkin truck.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY

EDWARDS stands in the middle of the tunnel vent room, the same one he
first came into yesterday. The elevator doors open and KAY, obviously
summoned by the OLD SECURITY GUARD, stands waiting for him.

				EDWARDS
		One thing you gotta know right now.

Edwards walks briskly forward and gets in the elevator with Kay.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

Inside the elevator, the doors WHOOSH shut, KAY turns a key in a certain
floor number, and the descent begins. EDWARDS continues.

				EDWARDS
		All right. I'm in because there's some
		next-level shit going on around here, and
		I'm with that. Before you beam me up, there
		are a couple of things we need to get
		straight. You chose me 'cause you recognize
		the skills. So as of now you can cease with
		all of that calling me "son" or "kid" or
		"sport." Cool?

				KAY
		Cool, slick. Now about those skills of yours,

The elevator doors --

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

-- slide open on Men in Black headquarters.

				KAY
		As of this moment, they don't mean much.

It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties
design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and
uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in
the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling,
shuffling papers.

KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out
over the whole place.

Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of
passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking
the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen
bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien
tongues.

Edwards slows as they pass, listening to the PASSPORT CONTROL OFFICER as
he addresses an ARQUILLIAN, a large, humanoid visitor.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Purpose of trip?

				ARQUILLIAN
		Diplomatic mission.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Duration of stay?

				ARQUILLIAN
		Lunch.

				PASSPORT OFFICER
		Carrying any fruits or vegetables?

Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries
him along.

				KAY
		Let's go. He's a little...grouchy.

Kay moves him into the central hall.

				KAY
		A couple of hours wait after a 17-light-year
		flight would get on anybody's nerves.

				EDWARDS
		What branch of the government do we report
		to?

				KAY
		None. They started asking too many questions.

				EDWARDS
		So who pays for all this?

				KAY
		Oh, we hold a few patents on gadgets we
		confiscated from our out-of-state visitors.
		Velcro. Microwave Ovens. Liposuction.

AT A STORAGE CAGE, Kay turns a key in the lock of a caged-in area and
throws the door open. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking
devices stacked on shelves and tabletops.

				KAY
			(picking something up)
		Here. A new recording device to replace
		CD's.  So now I gotta buy the White Album
		again?
			(something else)
		This is amusing. Universal translator.

He holds up a cylindrical metal tube and a small wire clip that looks like
a lapel microphone.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		We're not supposed to have it. I'll tell
		you why.  Human thought is so primitive
		it's considered an infectious disease.
		Makes you proud, doesn't it?

Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves.

				EDWARDS
		What's this?

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Don't touch that!

THE BALL ZINGS OUT OF EDWARDS' HANDS -- it flies out into the main complex
-- hits the ceiling and ricochets around the room, faster than the eye can
follow --

VARIOUS SHOTS OF HUMANS AND ALIENS ducking, dodging, and jumping out of
its way.

ON KAY as he calmly, a little wearily, slips an odd-looking metal glove
over his right hand...

He raises his hand and the yellow ball zings into it -- Kay catches the
ball, calmly.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Caused the '77 New York blackout. Practical
		joke by the Great Attractor. He thought it
		was funny as hell.

They leave the room.

				EDWARDS
		Sorry!

ON THE MAIN FLOOR, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant
screen on the far wall.

				KAY
		Observation, the heart of our little
		endeavor.

The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights
blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		This map shows the location of every
		registered alien on earth at any given
		time. Some of them we keep under constant
		surveillance.

He hits a button on the console and the map is replaced by hundreds of
boxes, each with smaller video images.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Everyone on these screens is an alien. In
		public -- normal. In private -- you'll get
		the idea.

ON THE SCREENS, we see live images of aliens. Aliens who look alien are in
spots where they can't be seen.  Aliens who look human are functioning
right out in public -- including SAM DONALDSON. MICHAEL JACKSON. And TONY
ROBBINS.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Meet the twins.

Kay gestures to two small, bony CREATURES with eight arms each and a
single eye growing out of a central stalk in their heads. They turn around
and wave two or three arms each.

				EDWARDS
		I gotta be honest about something.

				KAY
		It makes no sense?

				EDWARDS
		It makes perfect sense. When I was a third
		grader in Philadelphia, they told me I was
		crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was
		from, like, Venus or something.

				KAY
		Mrs. Edelson.

Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean
face, cat glasses. Bony fingers. Extremely well-hidden tail.

				KAY
		Jupiter, actually. Well, one of the moons.

With their remaining arms, they punch button after button on the enormous
console. ZED, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to
Edwards, sizing him up.

				ZED
		What's your jacket size, Edwards?

				EDWARDS
		Uh -- forty regular.

				ZED
		Then let's put it on.

				EDWARDS
		Put what on?

				ZED
		The last suit you'll ever wear.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Like the rest of the place, the MIB locker room is all white. White walls,
white floor, white ceiling, white lockers. ZED'S VOICE comes over:

				ZED (O.S.)
		From now on, you'll dress only in attire
		specially sanctioned by MIB Special
		Services.

EDWARDS reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a BLACK SUIT hung
from a hanger in the middle. Above it, on the shelf, a BLACK HAT and a
pair of BLACK SUNGLASSES. On the bottom, a pair of SHINY BLACK SHOES.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

KAY is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate,
driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. ZED'S
VOICE continues:

				ZED (O.S.)
		You'll conform to the identity we give you,
		eat where we tell you, live where we tell
		you, get approval for any expenditure over
		a hundred dollars.

INT. MIB BUILDING LASER BOOTH - DAY

EDWARDS stands in a cramped white booth.

He holds both his hands on a TEN-FINGERED KEYPAD, pressing down hard. The
pad glows red, a SEARING sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as
more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints.

				ZED (O.S.)
		You will have no identifying marks of any
		kind.  You will not stand out in any way.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

One by one, KAY deletes Edwards's identity cards.

On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- JAMES DARREL EDWARDS III.
Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to
left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Your entire image is carefully crafted to
		leave no lasting memory whatsoever with
		anyone you encounter.

INT. MIB BUILDING - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Pants come off the hanger. The white shirt is removed.

More letters are eliminated from his name. It reads "JAMES DARREL ED..."
then "JAMES DARR..."

				ZED (O.S.)
		You're a rumor, recognizable only as deja
		vu and dismissed just as quickly. You don't
		exist; you were never even born.

The coat is removed. The hat comes off the shelf.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Anonymity is your name. Silence your native
		tongue.

"JAMES..." "JAM..."

				ZED (O.S.)
		You are no longer part of "the system."
		We're above the system. Over it. Beyond it.

Feet slip into black shoes. A belt is buckled. A tie pushed up.

				ZED (O.S.)
		We're "them." We're "they."

On screen, all that's left is the letter "J."

As the coat is buttoned, we notice the sleeve. Monogrammed on the cuff is,
simply, the letter "J."

				ZED (O.S.)
		We are the Men in Black.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, JAMES D EDWARDS
III -- or, rather, JAY -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He
reaches into his pocket, takes out the sunglasses, and looks at KAY.

				JAY
		The difference between you and me?

He slips on the sunglasses.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		I make this look good.

								CUT TO:

EXT. NEW JERSEY - EARLY MORNING

We are looking at a telephoto shot of Manhattan in all its splendor.

We see the Orkin van topping a hill, heading towards Manhattan.

INT. MIB BUILDING - ZED'S OFFICE - DAY

Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of
MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five
video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another
Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock
ticking in a corner of the image.

While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk.

				ZED
		Okay, let's see.
			(to one of the monitors)
		Bee, we got the deposed sur-prefect of
		Sinalee touching down in the forest outside
		Portland tonight. I'm pulling you down from
		Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet.

BEE, an agent on one of the monitors, nods.

				BEE
		Humanoid?

				ZED
		You wish. Bring a sponge.
			(going through memos)
		What else -- everybody, we gotta keep
		Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system,
		he's scaring the rats. And Bobo the Squat
		wants to reveal himself on "Unsolved
		Mysteries." Bee, make sure he doesn't.

He turns a page, coming across a red memo.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		Red-letter from last night -- we had an
		un-authorized landing somewhere in upstate
		New York farm country. Keep your ears open
		for this one, Kay, we're not hosting a
		galactic kegger down here.

Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly.  Zed looks over at it.

				ZED
		Well, well, well -- we got a skimmer.

				KAY
			(to Jay)
		Landed alien out of zone.
			(to Zed)
		Who is it?

				ZED
		Redgick. He's not cleared to leave Manhattan
		but he's way out of town right now, stuck in
		traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike. Why
		don't you take Jay? This is a good one for
		him to warm up on.

EXT. MIB BUILDING - BATTERY PARK - DAY

JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters.

				JAY
		Yo, wussup with Zed?
			(imitating him)
		"Go get em, tiger. We're not hosting an
		intergalactic kegger..."

				KAY
		Zed was saving the world before you were
		born, son. Show some respect.

An MIB MECHANIC pulls up in Kay's black LTD and hops out, leaving the door
open. Jay sizes up the car.

				JAY
		We got the use of unlimited technology from
		the entire universe and we cruise around in
		this?

Kay glares at Jay. He's getting annoyed.

INT. MIB LTD - DAY

They get in and slam the doors. Kay starts the car and the engine HUMS
quietly.

				KAY
		Seat belt.

				JAY
		You know, ya'll gotta learn how to talk to
		people. You could be a little kinder and
		gentler.

Kay grits his teeth.

				KAY
		Buckle up, please.

				JAY
		Now did that hurt?

Kay shifts the car into reverse. The awesome power of the car kicks in and
Jay sails forward, THWACKING into the dash. Kay shifts into forward and
taps the gas, SLAMMING Jay back into his seat.

				KAY
		Makin' fun of my ride...

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats.  Jay's
hand falls by accident on a flashing red button in the panel.

				KAY
		Jay. The button?

				JAY
		Yeah?

				KAY
		Never push the button, Jay.

Jay jerks his hand away.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - DAY

The LTD is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it.
Ahead of it, another car has pulled over. KAY gets out, JAY follows a
moment later, shaky-legged. Kay walks up to the window of the car they've
stopped. The DRIVER, a guy in his mid-thirties with a WIFE in her
mid-thirties, rolls the window down.

				KAY
		License and registration, please.

The Driver hands over some documents. Kay flips through them.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Other license and registration, please.

The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Jay peers over
Kay's shoulder.

The photographs on the "RESIDENT ALIEN ID"cards are of two
friendly-looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera,
their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way.

Kay hands them back.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Your resident card has you restricted to
		the five boroughs only. Where do you think
		you're going?

				REDGICK
		It's my wife! She's -- she's -- well, look!

Kay leans down and looks in the window. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING
in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast.

				KAY
		Oh God. How soon?

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS in pain. Real soon. For the first time since we've
seen him, Kay is nervous.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Okay. All right. No big deal.
			(to Jay)
		You handle it.

				JAY
		Me?

				KAY
		Sure, it's easy, you just sorta -- catch.

Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried.

				REDGICK
		Are you sure he knows what he's doing?

				KAY
		Yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time.
		C'mon, let him work, Redgick, I wanna ask
		you something.

Kay gives Jay a supportive SLAP on the back and leads Redgick away, to the
rear of the car. Jay stays in the background and opens the rear door,
tentatively. He leans down, into the car.

				JAY
		Oh God! I see it I see it I see it!

A few yards from the car, Kay turns Redgick to face him.

				KAY
		Croagg the Midwife's back on 64th and 8th.
		You were headed out of town.

				REDGICK
		Well, we're, uh -- meeting someone.

Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the
whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold.

				JAY
		Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see
		that?!

				KAY
			(still to Redgick)
		So? Who you meeting?

				REDGICK
		Well, it's -- a ship.

				KAY
		Really? I didn't see a departure clearance
		for today.

				REDGICK
		You didn't? Uh, well -- it was an emergency.

Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and
pulls tight. He GASPS, choking.

				JAY
		Guys -- guys --

				KAY
		Doin' fine, Ace.
			(back to Redgick)
		What kind of emergency? What's the rush to
		get off the planet all of a sudden?

				JAY
			(choking to death)
		Help?! HELP! Hello?!

He starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going
against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to
pull the baby out.

				REDGICK
		We just don't like the neighborhood anymore.
		Some of the -- new arrivals.

Redgick looks at Kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes
away.

				KAY
		What new arrivals? This have anything to do
		with the crasher from last night?

				JAY
			(Screaming)
		Can you guys do this later?!

But in that moment, Jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires
leverage, and RIPS the baby free. He falls, flat on his back in the dirt,
the multi-tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Oh -- oh -- oh -- man.

Kay turns and claps Redgick on the back.

				KAY
		Congratulations! It's a lizard.

Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest.

				JAY
			(misty)
		Hey, you know, it is sorta --

It vomits on him.

								CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - SIDE OF THE ROAD - MIB LTD - DAY

Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY
starts up the car.

				KAY
		Anything about that seem unusual to you?

Jay just looks at him, very Jack Benny.

				JAY
		Pick.

				KAY
		What kind of "new arrival" would scare
		Redgick so bad that he'd risk a warp jump
		with a newborn?
			(thinks)
		Let's check the hot sheets.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them.
There are headlines like "POPE A FATHER!"and "TOP DOCTORS BAFFLED -- BABY
BORN PREGNANT!" and "MAN EATS OWN HOUSE!" (the subhead on that one is "And
That's Just the Appetizer, Says Neighbor.")

KAY and JAY are at a downtown newsstand. Kay is furiously searching
through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed.

				JAY
		These are the hot sheets?

Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy
a buck.

				KAY
		Best damn investigative reporting on the
		planet.  But hey, go ahead, read the New
		York Times if you want. They get lucky
		sometimes.

				JAY
		You're actually looking for tips in a
		supermarket tabloid?

				KAY
		Not looking for. Found.

He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned
open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for
the Second Coming:

			     Farm wife says
		     "ALIEN STOLE MY HUSBAND'S SKIN!"

								CUT TO:

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - ORKIN VAN - DAY

A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off EDGAR's
neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. He sucks as hard as he
possibly can on a straw stuck into a Jolt Cola ("Double the Sugar! Triple
the Caffeine!"), one of a six-pack that sits on the dashboard.

Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the
jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. Edgar drops the soda and stares.

The Older Man (ROSENBERG), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood
jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat
on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive
shop.

That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down
the street, one under each arm.

Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along
behind him.

ON THE STREET, Rosenberg walks happily along, HUMMING to himself. He gives
his cat a little peck. As he rounds a corner, we recognize the tune he's
humming -- "I've Got the Whole World In My Hands."

The Orkin van rounds the corner behind him. Following.

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway that leads to
Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed. The wrecked pickup
truck is still there. JAY and KAY get out, very undercover cop. Jay starts
up the driveway.

				KAY
		Not so fast. Walk up slow.

				JAY
		Why?

				KAY
		Part of the routine. Makes it look like
		we're sizing up the situation. Gives her
		time to get the wrong impression.

BEATRICE appears in the door to the house, curious.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Puts some fear into her. Makes things go
		smoother.

Beatrice calls to them.

				BEATRICE
		Can I help you gentlemen?

Beatrice looks much better than the last time we saw her -- more nicely
dressed, a touch of makeup, a smile on her face.

Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to her as she draws
close. As she reaches for it, the card reforms into an FBI badge.

				KAY
		How do you do, ma'am, I'm Special Agent
		Manheim, this is Agent Black, FBI. Had a
		few questions about your visitor.

				BEATRICE
		Are you here to make fun of me too?

				KAY
		No ma'am. We at the FBI don't have a sense
		of humor that we're aware of. Mind if we
		come in?

				BEATRICE
		Sure. Lemonade?

								CUT TO:

INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

In the living room, KAY sips some of her lemonade and winces. JAY moves
through the room, checking it out as BEATRICE tells her story.

				BEATRICE
		And they said to me, "If he was murdered,
		how could he walk back in the house?" And I
		must admit, I was a little stumped by that
		one. But I know Edgar. And that wasn't him.
		It was more like something else that was
		wearing him. Like a suit. An Edgar suit.

A little GIGGLE escapes her at the thought. Jay, over by a bookcase,
notices a framed PHOTO OF EDGAR, kneeling in the woods, proudly about to
skin a deer.

				JAY
		Damn. If he was this ugly before he was an
		alien...

				BEATRICE
		Sorry?

				KAY
		Go on.

				BEATRICE
		Anyway, when I came to, he was gone.

				KAY
		Did he say anything?

				BEATRICE
		Yes! He asked for water. Sugar water, if I
		remember.

				KAY
		Sugar water.

				JAY
		Did you taste her lemonade?

Kay nods, puts on his sunglasses. Takes out another pair, hands them to
Jay.

Kay draws his neuralyzer. FLASH! Beatrice freezes, staring straight ahead
as if hypnotized. Kay takes Jay's glasses off and hands them back to him.

				KAY
		Ray Bans.
			(pulling off Jay's
			sunglasses)
		Okay, Beatrice. There was no alien, and the
		flash of light you saw in the sky wasn't a
		UFO. Swamp gas from a weather balloon was
		trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted
		the light from Venus --

				JAY
		Whoa! That thing erases her memory, and you
		give her a new one?

				KAY
		Standard issue neuralyzer.

				JAY
		And that's the best you can come up with?

				KAY
		On a more personal note, Beatrice, Edgar
		ran off with on old girlfriend. Go stay at
		your mother's for a few days and get over
		it. Decide you're better off.

				JAY
			(butting in)
		Yeah, and you're better off 'cause he never
		appreciated you anyway. In fact, you kicked
		him out, and now that he's gone, you ought
		to buy some new clothes, maybe hire a
		decorator or something...

								CUT TO:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

KAY is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating. He holds a pocket
spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth.  The analyzer shifts
colors.  Red. Then Yellow.

				JAY
			(from up outside the hole)
		Hey. Kay...when am I gonna get one of those
		memory things?

The spectral analyzer turns blue.

				KAY
		When you're ready.
			(re: analyzer)
		Please -- not green.

Purple. And then green.

Kay closes his eyes and sits back, leaning against the dirt. Above him,
JAY leans over, staring down. Kay looks up at him.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Do you know what alien life form leaves a
		green spectral trail?

				JAY
		Wait -- don't tell me -- that was the
		question on Final Jeopardy last night.

AT THE CAR, Kay snatches up the radio handset and keys the microphone.

				KAY
			(softly, into mic)
		Zed, we have a bug.

He turns off the radio and sighs. Jay stands next to him.

				JAY
		I'm gonna jump way past you and just guess
		that this is bad. Right?

				KAY
		Bugs thrive on carnage, Tiger.  They
		consume, infest and destroy. They live off
		the death and decay of other species.

				JAY
		So basically you have a racial problem with
		all insect-based life forms?

				KAY
		Listen, kid -- imagine a giant cockroach
		five times smarter than Albert Einstein,
		four times stronger than an ox, nine times
		meaner than hell, strutting his stuff
		around Manhattan Island in his brand new
		Edgar suit. Does that sound like fun?

				JAY
		What do we do?

				KAY
		With a bug in town? Watch the morgues.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing
district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into
Leshko's, a Russian diner.

A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative
darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an
enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid
fifties.

Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. The
man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien
on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. He
steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table.
Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it.

Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --

-- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to
it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and
both seemed choked with emotion.

Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre
alien tongue, which is subtitled. Rosenberg wipes away tears.

				ROSENBERG
		Sorry I'm late. The cab drivers on this
		planet are terrible.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Your majesty, you are in grave danger.

				ROSENBERG
		Yeah, and they overcharge you every time.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Sir, a bug landed here. We must get you off
		the planet.

				ROSENBERG
		A bug? He must know why I'm here.

				ARQUILLIAN
		We think he does.
			(noticing the ornate box
			on the table)
		Is that what I think it is?

				ROSENBERG
		No, just some diamonds for your children.
		Do we have time to eat?

The Arquillian relaxes.

				ARQUILLIAN
		Sure. I ordered you some pirogi.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - KITCHEN - DAY

In the kitchen, the Russian COOK slaps two orders of pirogi up on the
stainless steel counter --

				COOK
		Table six is up!

-- and turns away, back to the grill.

A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. We follow
the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter
carrying it. He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of
swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant.

The doors swing in as another WAITER sweeps into the kitchen, and our
waiter heads out into the dining area. As the doors swing closed behind
him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed
tomatoes --

-- and a DEAD WAITER, literally folded in half and stuffed in among the
shelves.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

ROSENBERG and the ARQUILLIAN raise their glasses in a toast.

				ARQUILLIAN
		To the continued reign of the Arquillian
		Empire.

				ROSENBERG
		To the safety of the galaxy.

They CLINK glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives. Still, we see
only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the
plates of pirogi. He carries them to the table and sets them down.

Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of
the Waiter's hand --

-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve
and scurries across the table. The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand,
dumping wine all over the table.

He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face.

It's EDGAR. Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of
Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian
freeze, paralyzed with fear. They seem to know what dire implications
Edgar's presence holds.

				ROSENBERG
			(in English again)
		You can kill us both -- but you will not
		find it.

Edgar smiles.

				EDGAR
		You're right about one thing.

Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and
zips under the table. First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch
forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain.

They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.

The stinger SNAPS out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's
apron. He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what
he's looking for. The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, HISSES
at him.

Edgar reaches out and BATS the cat away with one vicious swipe of his
hand. The animal HOWLS and flies across the room, landing in a WOMAN's
lunch.

The Woman SCREAMS. Now other DINERS' attention is drawn to Edgar's table,
where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter. There are
SHOUTS of outrage, a few MEN rise out of their seats.

Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked. With
the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for
the door.

Rosenberg's cat leaps back onto the table and SNARLS at him as he goes.

								CUT TO:

EXT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

Later, and the Russian diner is now a crime scene, clustered with COPS and
flashing lights. THREE BODIES, now on stretchers and covered with sheets,
are being loaded into the back of ambulances.

ROSENBERG'S CAT races out of a UNIFORMED COP's arms and leaps onto one of
the stretchers, MEOWING mournfully. The Uniformed Cop turns to a POLICE
INSPECTOR who is questioning the WOMAN from the diner.

				COP
		What am I supposed to do with the cat?

				INSPECTOR
		I don't know. Send it with the stiff. Let
		family claim it.

The Cop nods and follows the stretcher with Rosenberg's body into the back
of one of the ambulances, allowing the cat to ride on the chest of its
dead owner for the time being.

The doors of the wagon SLAM shut.

								CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

The stretcher with the corpse on it is wheeled down a corridor in police
headquarters. ROSENBERG'S CAT, still on his chest, MEOWS curiously as the
stretcher approaches two doors with "City Morgue" written across them. The
words split in half as the stretcher BANGS through the doors.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

The city morgue is a crowded, brightly-lit, tiled place with corpses
parked left and right. Busy day in the Apple. The Cop wheeling the
stretcher calls out to the CORONER, who's hunched over another body.

				COP
		Where do you want contestant number three?

The coroner turns around. It's DR. LAUREL WEAVER, the woman who tried to
speak to Jay before. She sighs and waves a hand.

				LAUREL
		By the wall, I guess.
			(noticing)
		What's with the cat?

				COP
		Oh, the cat. There's a problem with the cat.
		Sign here.

Laurel signs his clipboard.

				LAUREL
		What's the problem with the cat?

				COP
		Your problem.

Laurel gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes over to
the stretcher and bends down, petting Rosenberg's cat gently.

				LAUREL
		Are you having a bad day, baby?  Cheer up.
			(of Rosenberg)
		His is worse.

She sets the cat aside and wheels the stretcher under the lights.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		Okey-dokey. Shall we?

INT. MORGUE - LATER - DAY

Laurel is hunched over the corpse, the only light in the room coming from
the overhead spot that illuminates her work.

Fascinated by something, she digs deeper. And deeper. And looks up, her
face a mixture of alarm and excitement.

				LAUREL
		Oh, my God.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

Kay's LTD pulls up in front of the morgue.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two men in black suits hurry down the stairs and into the corridor outside
the morgue. They hasten down the hallway, their shoes CLICKING in perfect
lockstep, headed for those swinging doors at the other end.

JAY and KAY. Men in Black on a mission.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

In the morgue, LAUREL has fallen asleep on her desk, her head in her arms.
ROSENBERG'S CAT sits on the desk next to her, licking its paws. Suddenly,
the cat looks up, MEOWING urgently.

Laurel looks up and, following the cat's gaze, turns around slowly in her
chair. JAY and KAY stand in the doorway, staring at her. Kay steps
forward, holding out that black card again. It reforms into another kind
of official ID, this time it says "DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH"

				LAUREL
			(into recorder)
		...approximately 112 degrees at time of
		autopsy, indicating, quite impossibly, a
		post-mortem increase in body temperature.
		Examiner attempted to verify result
		rectally, only to find subject was, uh,
		without rectum. Which can only be described
		as...well...as really...

				KAY (O.S.)
		Weird? Dr. Leo Menville, Department of
		Public Health. This is Dr. White.

She looks up. Jay and Kay are standing there.

				LAUREL
		Yeah, well whoever you are, I'm afraid I'm
		going to need to see some ID.

He hands her his CARTE NOIR, which changes to read "Dr. Menville,
Department of Public Health." She hands it back.

				LAUREL
			(checking her watch)
		You boys must not have much of a home life.

				KAY
		We watch the morgues very carefully. You've
		got something unusual?

				LAUREL
		I'd say so -- triple homicide.

She gets up and goes to the Arquillian's body, which is still out on a
table under the lights.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		The first corpse was perfectly normal,
		except that he was broken in half, but when
		I opened up the other two -- well, look.

She throws back a sheet, revealing (to them only, not us) the fully
dissected Arquillian. Kay raises an eyebrow; Jay nearly retches.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		There's a skeletal structure at work here
		unlike anything I've ever seen.

Kay steps past her, going straight to the body. He begins to examine it.

				KAY
		I'll have a look at this one. Dr. White,
		why don't you and Dr. Weaver check out the
		other body?

				LAUREL
		This way, Doctor.

Jay and Laurel cross the room, to where ROSENBERG's corpse lies out on
another gurney.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		This one's even stranger. I did a full
		laparotomy. I started with the lesser
		curvature of the stomach -- though, if you
		want, we could begin at the gastro-esophageal
		junction.

				JAY
		I think, uh, we should start at the same
		place you did.

				LAUREL
		All right.

Jay hears a MEOW and looks down. Rosenberg's cat is rubbing up against his
leg.

				JAY
		Your cat?

				LAUREL
		Guess it is now. Came in with the bodies.

She SNAPS one of her rubber gloves and reaches down (out of frame),
sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside. Just by the
look on Jay's face, one can imagine how disgusting it is.

Laurel digs in, up to her elbows. Jay winces. She pulls one bloody glove
out, to wipe a strand of hair out of her face. He looks at her --

-- and she winks at him. He's surprised. She laughs.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		Okay. Dive right in. God knows he won't
		mind.

Jay is reluctant, so she rolls her eyes and helps him, taking him by the
hand and guiding him into the thick of the corpse.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		You have very pretty eyes.

				JAY
		Thank-you, but is this really the time to
		uh -- you know, come on to me?

				LAUREL
		Hey, just walking the dog.
			(continuing)
		Feel that? Where the piloric junction would
		be?

				JAY
		Oh, yes. Exactly.

				LAUREL
		Now push that aside. Notice anything
		strange? Stomach? Liver? Lungs?

				JAY
		Nope. All fine.

				LAUREL
		Doctor, they're all missing.

				JAY
			(quickly)
		Well, of course they are. What I'm pointing
		out is that there are no pieces of them
		left. So they're intact, wherever they are.
		That we can be sure of.

				LAUREL
		Have we met before? I have the strangest
		feeling of deja vu.

				JAY
		You know, I was just going to ask you the
		same thing.

Laurel looks at him sideways, skeptical, but also intrigued. She whispers
to him. Confiding in him.

				LAUREL
		Okay. You wanna know what I really think?
			(re: Kay)
		But don't tell that guy. He looks like he's
		already under enough stress.
			(then)
		This body is not really a body, but it's
		actually some sort of transport unit for
		something else altogether. The question is:
		what?

Jay just looks at her intrigued.

				LAUREL
		By the way, stop me if I'm freaking you out.

				JAY
		No, no...not at all.

After a particularly gross GUSHY sound, he looks away, toward her. She's
staring at him.

Laurel leans over and lowers her voice, just for him.

				LAUREL
		You know what I like to do sometimes? When
		it's really late?

				JAY
			(freaked out)
		No...

From the other side of the room, Kay CLEARS HIS THROAT.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Excuse me.

He walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian.
But Jay never takes his eyes off Laurel.

				KAY
		What do you think?

				JAY
			(of Laurel)
		Very interesting. Got a real Queen of the
		Undead thing goin' on.

				KAY
		Of the body.

				JAY
		Great body.

				KAY
		The dead body?

				JAY
		Not a clue.

				KAY
		All right. Keep her occupied. Try not to
		sound too dumb.

ACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next
to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something
strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay.

				LAUREL
		Dr. White.

Jay, in conversation with Kay, does not respond to what is not his name.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
			(louder)
		Dr. White.
			(still louder)
		Dr. White.

He still doesn't answer.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
			(shouting)
		DR. WHITE!

Kay nudges Jay.

				KAY
		You're up, Slugger.

Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her.

				LAUREL
		Look at this.

Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's
ear.

				JAY
		What is that?

He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft
CLICK --

-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.

Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and
Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES
OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial
skull.

A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.

Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He
staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with
gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.

				LAUREL
		Far -- freaking -- out.

They lean in closer. The Tiny Little Green Man (a BALTIAN) forces words
out of his mouth.

				BALTIAN
		Must -- to pre -- prevent --
			(searching for the word)
		-- contest? No...to prevent --

				JAY
		It's all right -- What are you trying to
		say? Struggle?

				LAUREL
		War?

The Baltian nods vigorously. That's it.

				BALTIAN
			(faltering)
		Galaxy on -- or -- or -- Orion's --
			(thinks)
		What is word? Be...?

				JAY
		Bed? Belt? Orion's Belt?

The Baltian nods again, falls, and dies. Jay and Laurel look at the little
dead alien, then at each other.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		"To prevent war, the galaxy is on Orion's
		Belt?"  The hell does that mean?
			(turns around)
		Hey! Kay! I mean, Dr., uh, whatever, come
		here!

Kay begins over. Laurel looks at them.

				LAUREL
		"Doctor Whatever"? You're not with the
		Department of Public Health, are you?

Jay shakes his head -- but is now paying more attention to Kay, as he
leads him toward the Little Man.

				JAY
		He's dead.

Kay looks at the mess -- the body, the little dead man.

				KAY
		Rosenberg. Damn. Good man.

				JAY
		You knew him?

				KAY
		One of the few I actually liked. Exiled
		High Prince.

				LAUREL
		I was right -- this is an alien life form,
		and you're from some government agency who
		wants to keep it under wraps...

Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel.

				JAY
		He said "to prevent war, the galaxy is on
		Orion's Belt."

				LAUREL
		... This make total sense. How else do you
		explain New York? The other night I'm in a
		cab, this guy...

FLASH! Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and
blanks her out.

				KAY
		He said there's a galaxy on Orion's Belt?
		That makes no sense.

				JAY
		That's what he said.
			(to the dazed Laurel)
		Didn't he? Right after he --
			(realizing)
		Oh, for Christ's sake, you did the flashy
		thing already.

				LAUREL
			(as if awakening)
		Uh, hi, whoever you guys are, I'm afraid
		I'm going to need to see some ID if you're
		going to be in the morgue, okay?

				KAY
		Sure thing, sweetheart. Here you go.

FLASH! He neuralyzes her again. Jay slaps his hand.

				JAY
		Stop that --

				KAY
			(to Laurel, ignoring Jay)
		Typical day, too much caffeine, get a life.

				JAY
		-- that thing probably gives you brain
		cancer!

				KAY
		Never hurt her before.

				JAY
		"Never hurt her before"?! How many times
		have you done the flashy thing to this poor
		woman?!

				KAY
			(evasive)
		Couple.

				JAY
		Aren't you worried about, you know, long
		term damage?

				KAY
			(more evasive)
		Little bit.

				JAY
		What the hell happened to make you such a
		callous son of a bitch?

				KAY
		I took this job.

He heads out. Jay follows.

				JAY
		Hey, you never flashed me with that thing,
		did you?

				KAY
		Nah.

EXT. MORGUE - NIGHT

Jay and Kay exit the morgue and walk towards their car.

				JAY
		Hey, Kay, I really think I should be in
		charge of the flashy memory thing
		department.

				KAY
		Not while I'm around, Slim.

				JAY
		Yeah, well you're a menace with that
		thing...

An MIB containment vehicle pulls up, and four men dressed in black suits
get out.

				KAY
			(to an MIB Agent)
		We've got two dead aliens in there, and a
		deputy medical coroner in need of a new
		memory.

EXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside,
throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard. Two PASSERSBY hear the racket
and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved.

But an inhuman GROWL rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on
their way.

INT. ORKIN VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT

Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its
various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his
way into it. Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship,
Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the
rest of the box and SMACKS it with his right fist. Nothing doing.

He BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it
finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off
with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box.

Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he
promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.

				EDGAR
		No. No, NO, NO, NOOOO!

He rips the box apart with his bare hands. There's nothing else there.

EXT. MIB BUILDING - MAGIC HOUR

As lower Manhattan is waking up, Jay and Kay enter the building.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING

Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large
screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION
ORION.

Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads
for Zed.

				JAY
		Doesn't anybody believe in sleep around
		here?

				ZED
		The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time
		-- a 37-hour day. Give it a few months --
		you'll get used to it. Or you'll have a
		psychotic episode.

He points up at the screen with a laser pencil.

				ZED
		Here's Orion; the brightest grouping of
		stars in the northern sky...
			(pointing)
		and here's Orion's belt --

He indicates the three stars that make up the belt.

				JAY
		That's what the little guy was talking
		about, "To prevent war, the galaxy's on
		Orion's belt..."

				ZED
		There are no galaxies on Orion's belt. The
		belt is just these three stars; galaxies
		are huge, made up of billions of stars.
			(switches off the laser
			pointer)
		You heard wrong.

				JAY
		You're attracted to me, aren't you?

Jay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone,
tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word "SEARCHING"
blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of
North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest.

On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a
neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to
"SUBJECT ACQUIRED."

The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we
get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
			SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON
			 PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE
			 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ
Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic
table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by
an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind
him.

Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at
Kay's expression, then back at the monitor.

				JAY
		Pretty lady...

Kay clicks off the picture of her. Jay drags a chair and sits down.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		You were the guy with the flowers in the
		photo, (the night the aliens arrived.)
		(What, you were on your way to a dance or
		something and you got lost? And she never
		got those flowers, did she?]

Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if
she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky,
wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Grumpy Guy's story comes into focus. She
		ever get married?

				KAY
		No.

It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The
monitor goes blank, except for a data screen:
			    SUBJECT LOST
Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at
him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

				JAY
		Well, it's better to have loved and lost
		than never to have --

				KAY
		Try it.

				ZED (O.S.)
		Kay.

Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each
of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a
flickering LIGHT.

Some lights are starting to go out.

				KAY
			(quietly, with dread)
		They're leaving.

				ZED
		We've had twelve jumps in the last hour.
		Redgick was just the beginning.

				JAY
		What do they know that we don't know?

Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Another light flickers out.

				KAY
		Why do rats desert the ship?
			(to the twins)
		Go to Lem Sat IV. Put up a forty-field view
		of Manhattan.

ON THE SCREEN New York City is just a bright spot of light on the Eastern
coast of the United States.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Four hundred.

Now there's a view of the earth from space. Nothing unusual.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Four thousand.

Now we're looking at earth from far, far away -- and from here we can see
something that doesn't belong in this picture:

A BATTLE CRUISER far off to one side of the earth. The words "LEVEL FOUR"
flash in red letters on one side of the map.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		That's an Arquillian battle cruiser.

				JAY
		And we've got a dead Arquillian prince.

A COMMUNICATION STARTS COMING OVER THE SPEAKERS -- a sound like a cat and
mouse caught in a blender.

				KAY
		Message coming in.

The communication continues.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Speak of the devil.

The communication continues.

				JAY
		They sound pissed.

				ZED
			(to the twins)
		Translate that and step on it!
			(to Kay)
		Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg's store and
		see what you can turn up.

Kay and Jay walk away.

				ZED (CONT'D)
		And Kay -- take a lot of fire power.

IN THE EQUIPMENT LOCKER Kay pulls out the ENORMOUS, MANY-BARRELED HAND
GUN. A small, clear, canister sprouts from underneath it, malicious
swirling gases visible through its walls.

				JAY
		I like that.

				KAY
		Series four de-atomizer.

Kay pulls out another weapon, the TINIEST GUN WE'VE EVER SEEN.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Here. We call this the "Noisy Cricket."

				JAY
		You get a series four de-atomizer and I get
		a "Noisy Cricket?!"
			(looks at the gun)
		I'm afraid I'm going to break it.

Jay follows Kay out, glancing back to see the huge gun turrets on the
Arquillian Battle Cruiser HUM and WHIR as they swing around into position,
pointed down at the unwitting planet below.

								CUT TO:

INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

SMASH! The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses
in a shower of glass. EDGAR reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing
them one by one. He gets them all and steps inside. Out the window behind
him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front.

All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING
the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.

Outside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van
and starts to hitch up.

Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed
pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring
intently at it. It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed
on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some
posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to
Rosenberg.

From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in
time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the
ground.

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

EDGAR rushes outside as the tow truck DRIVER gets the van up on the hoist.

				EDGAR
		That's my truck!

				DRIVER
		And make sure you tell them that at the
		impound.

Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve
gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at
him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun.

				DRIVER (CONT'D)
		I got worse.

He keeps hitching up the van. Two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very
fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. We go with them, and
realize that it's --

-- JAY and KAY. They stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and
exchange a glance. Kay pulls a very menacing-looking weapon, nods, and
they step inside.

INT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

They look around and see the recent demolition caused by Edgar. Jay
furrows his brow.

				JAY
		Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the
		jewels?

				KAY
		Someone who's not looking for jewels.

Jay moves behind the counter. On the floor is an ornate, empty bowl and a
bag of cat food, next to a scrumptious pillow. There are several PHOTOS OF
A CAT on the wall.

There is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay picks up one of the
COLLARS, inspects it closely, shaking his head.

				JAY
		This guy had a serious crush on his cat.

Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside,
lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR.

Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?

Suddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the
driver's shotgun. Before Edgar can shoot, Jay YELLS...

				JAY
		Kay! GET DOWN!

And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR
on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING
him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down
the street as Jay picks himself up.

				JAY
		The bug in the Edgar suit! The ugly redneck
		from the picture! That's him!

Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar.

				KAY
			(picking himself up)
		Damn it.

Kay runs out after Jay.

EXT. GEM AND JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps
behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The
engine ROARS.

Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into
some pedestrians, while his SHOT...

Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the
two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it
accelerates too quickly.

Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to
try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND
THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.

JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through
the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in
the woman driver's face.

When Jay looks up, Kay is standing before him. He yanks Jay out of the
car.

				KAY
		We do not discharge our weapons in view of
		the public.

				JAY
		Can we drop the cover-up bullshit?! There's
		an Alien Battle Cruiser that's gonna blow-up
		the world if we don't...

				KAY
		There's always an Alien Battle Cruiser...or
		a Korlian Death Ray, or...an intergalactic
		plague about to wipe out life on this
		planet, and the only thing that lets people
		get on with their hopeful little lives is
		that they don't know about it.

Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the
store. There's smoking rubble everywhere.

				KAY
		Don't worry about the bug. He's not leaving
		town. We've got his ship.

After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is
neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone.

				KAY
			(into phone)
		Zed, we're gonna need a containment crew
		down here at McDougal, south of Houston.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Back at Men in Black Headquarters, the little lights on the world map
which indicate aliens' locations are going out, one by one, about one
every five or ten seconds. A WARNING BUZZER is sounding, over and over,
and HUMAN STAFFERS are rushing left and right.

ZED is in his office.

				ZED
		Containment may be a moot point, my friend.
		The exodus continues. It's like the party's
		over and the last one to leave gets stuck
		with the check.

Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with
suitcases walking across the floor.

				ZED
		You sorry little ingrates!

				KAY (O.S.)
		What about the Arquillians?

				ZED
		We've only translated a part of the message
		so far: "Deliver the Galaxy."

				KAY (O.S.)
		No, they don't want much, do they?

				ZED
		Oh, it gets better... They're holding us
		responsible.

He looks up at the screen. It reads:
				   MIB
			   DELIVER THE GALAXY.

				ZED
		Another contestant has entered the ring.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET (OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE)

As Kay puts away his phone, turns to Jay

				KAY
		All right, kid. The Arquillians want the
		galaxy, whatever the hell that means. We
		need help. A professional. Someone with
		years of experience in intergalactic
		politics. I just hope the little prick
		hasn't skipped town.

								CUT TO:

EXT. UPTOWN NEWSSTAND - DAY

The tow truck SQUEALS to a halt at a curb.  EDGAR gets out and walks away,
fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he
passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.

				EDGAR
		Where do you keep your dead?

				VENDOR
			(thinks)
		I don't have any dead.

				EDGAR
		Where?!

				VENDOR
		I don't know, the city morgue!

Edgar shoves him away roughly. But before he leaves, his eye catches a
postcard display marked "LANDMARKS OF THE NEW YORK CITY AREA." Edgar
stares, fascinated, but we don't see what he's looking at. He reaches out
and picks up a color postcard.

He raises it to his face, thinking, then shoves it in his pocket and
hurries off.

								CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - KEY KIOSK - DAY

Kay's LTD SCREECHES to a halt in front of the kiosk on Orchard Street. JAY
and KAY leap out and Jay spots the VENDOR, closing up the shop. He's
wearing a dirty cardigan, watch cap, and fingerless gloves, his face
aquiver with ticks and mannerisms. He has a small dog in front of him.

Jay rolls his eyes as they step up to the counter.

				JAY
		Of course that guy's an alien. That's gotta
		be the worst disguise I've ever seen.

A voice answers him, but not the Vendor's.

				FRANK THE PUG
		You don't like it, you can kiss my furry
		little butt.

Jay looks down. The voice is coming from the dog. This is FRANK THE PUG.
Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears.

				KAY
		You busy, Frank?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Sorry, Kay, I can't talk right now, my
		ride's leaving in --

Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog.

				KAY
		Call the pound. We got a stray.

				FRANK THE PUG
		Hey! Get your paws off me!

PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor
little dog. Jay tries to explain.

				JAY
		The, uh...dog owes my friend some money.

				KAY
			(to Frank)
		Arquillians and bugs. What do you know?

				FRANK THE PUG
		I know nothing.

				KAY
		Not a thing?

Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer.

				FRANK THE PUG
		Stop it. Okay, okay. Rosenberg wasn't some
		two-bit Arquillian. He was the guardian of
		a galaxy. They thought he would be safe
		here on earth.

				KAY
		And the bug had other plans.

				FRANK THE PUG
		The galaxy is the best source for subatomic
		energy in the universe. If the bugs get
		their slimy claws on it, kiss the
		Arquillians goodbye.

				JAY
		Ask him about the belt.

				KAY
			(to Frank)
		Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on
		"Orion's belt." What's he talking about,
		Frank?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Beats me.

Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more.

				JAY
			(to a person passing by)
		They're rehearsing a ventriloquist act.

				FRANK THE PUG
		The galaxy is here.

				KAY
		Here?

				JAY
		The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars
		and planets? How's it here?

If a dog can smirk, Frank does.

				FRANK THE PUG
		You humans, when're you gonna learn that
		size doesn't matter? Just 'cause something's
		important, doesn't mean it's not very, very
		small.

				KAY
		How small?

				FRANK THE PUG
		Tiny. Like the size of a marble. Or a jewel.
		Now if you'll excuse me, I need to be walked
		before the flight.

Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought.

				KAY
			(to Frank the Pug)
		Get out of here.
			(then to Jay)
		The galaxy's here. It's not on Orion's belt.

Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the
sidewalk.

				JAY
		Kay...

								CUT TO:

INT. MORGUE - DAY

In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT
leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the
middle of the file she's studying.

Laurel jumps.

				LAUREL
		Boy, when you want attention --

She pets the cat. As she does, the cat's collar shines in the light.
Laurel turns the name tag to face her.

CLOSE ON A PRECIOUS JEWEL, AND THE WORD "ORION."

As it is written across the collar of the cat.

				LAUREL (O.S)
		"Orion." That's a pretty name.

From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING.

Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON
of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened,
translucent material, light green in color.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		What's this?

She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement.

INT. ICON - DAY

It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes
beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of
stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed
of light.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

				LAUREL
		Wow.

Outside, the bell DINGS again. Orion looks up, as if knowing who's out
there, and not liking it. She SNARLS at the door and leaps off the desk,
scurrying across the lab and disappearing under some equipment.

INT./EXT. LTD - MANHATTAN - DAY

Jay and Kay barrel through town.

				JAY
		So two galaxies have been fighting for
		years. And the only people who've been
		benefiting are a race of creatures called
		bugs. Then the two galaxies decide to make
		peace...and the bugs send this guy down to
		make sure the fighting never stops.

				KAY
		By killing the emissaries, and stealing the
		galaxy they've been fighting about.

				JAY
		And if we don't get it back before he
		leaves the planet...we're history.

				KAY
		We're not even history. 'Cause history
		implies there's someone around to remember
		it.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

On a counter in the morgue corridor, a gray, peeling hand BANGS on a bell
on a countertop, over and over. The hand belongs to EDGAR, who is carrying
his shotgun, concealing it behind one leg. The morgue attendant, TONY,
emerges from a small security cage carrying a worn paperback copy of Atlas
Shrugged and a fly swatter.

				TONY
		Thank you for making sure the bell works.

Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a
BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces.

				TONY (CONT'D)
			(to Edgar)
		What's up, Farmer John?

				EDGAR
		A man came in here earlier. A dead man.

				TONY
		And this means what to me?

				EDGAR
		He was a very dear friend of mine. And I
		believe he had an animal with him. A gift
		I gave him, a pet cat that means worlds to
		me. I would like it back.

				TONY
		I'll need a picture ID, written proof of
		ownership of the cat, or notarized proof of
		kinship with --

WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its
maker. Edgar grits his teeth.

				TONY (CONT'D)
		-- the deceased.

				EDGAR
		Don't -- do that.

WHACK! Still another fly goes down.

				TONY
		Do what?

Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen
cockroaches stream out of his sleeve.

				TONY (CONT'D)
		Shit!

He ducks under the counter --

-- and comes up with a can of Raid. Edgar's eyes bug out.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MORGUE - DAY

Kay's LTD pulls to a stop in front of the morgue and JAY and KAY jump out.

				JAY
		I'll handle this one, you wait outside.

				KAY
		What the hell for?

				JAY
		Because all we have to do is walk in and
		get a cat, it's not that hard. But if you
		go in, you're gonna lay your Jack Webb on
		her and flash your brain ray in her face
		and she's gonna end up with leukemia or
		some shit. The woman's a doctor, she
		doesn't need you erasing half her med
		school classes. Take me five minutes.

And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside.

				KAY
		Two minutes!

INT. MORGUE - DAY

LAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR.
He leans in, close, furious.

				EDGAR
		Where is the animal?!

				LAUREL
		I told you, I don't know, it ran under some
		equipment! Over there.

				EDGAR
		Get it!

He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment
she pointed to. As they draw close, ORION the cat bolts from underneath
it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets,
landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between
it and the ceiling. A very tough hiding place.

Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the BELL and a VOICE from the
corridor outside.

				JAY (O.S.)
		Hello? Anybody here?

Edgar looks up at the cat's hiding place. No time to get it. The bell
DINGS again.

				JAY (O.S.)
		Hello?

Roughly, Edgar pulls Laurel close and puts a finger to his lips --
"Shhhhhhh."

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

In the corridor, JAY looks around. No Tony, no answer to the bell.  He
DINGS once more, then heads into the back.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

JAY comes into the morgue. LAUREL is in there, standing right up next to
an examination table, but there is no corpse on the table, just a sheet
draped over it. She just stands there, in the middle of the room, staring
at Jay.

				JAY
		Uh, hi.

				LAUREL
			(oddly)
		Hello.

				JAY
			(flashes a badge)
		I'm Sergeant Friday, from the Twenty-Sixth
		precinct. They brought a cat in here with a
		corpse the other day, might have said
		"Orion" on the cat's name tag?

				LAUREL
		Yes. That's right.

				JAY
		Right, well, the cat is, uh -- the cat's a
		witness in a murder case and I'm going to
		need to take it with me.

				LAUREL
		I don't know where the cat is at the moment.

				JAY
		You don't?

				LAUREL
		No.
			(lowers her voice to a
			whisper)
		Maybe you could take me with you instead.

Jay looks at her.

				JAY
		Excuse me?

				LAUREL
		I said, maybe you could take me with you
		instead.

				JAY
		Damn, you do start fast, don't you?

				LAUREL
		I'd really like to go with you. Now.

Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this
woman. He looks over his shoulder, to make sure he has a few more seconds
alone.

				JAY
		And, uh, why exactly is that?

Laurel rolls her eyes. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go
with what she's saying.

				LAUREL
		I just do.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

KAY comes down the stairs and into the morgue corridor.  He checks his
watch, then leans against the counter and pulls out a pack of cigarettes.
Waiting.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Jay is thoroughly enjoying himself, but Laurel seems to be going crazy.

				LAUREL
		I have something I need to show you.

She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.

				JAY
		Now slow down, you don't have to hit the
		gas like that.

She leans in and lowers her voice.

				LAUREL
		You don't understand. You really need to
		see this.

				JAY
		And I will. But we gotta get something
		straight here -- I'm gonna drive. It's not
		some kind of macho trip, it's just the way
		I'm used to doing things, okay?

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it
to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp
SIZZLE.

Kay furrows his brow. Odd.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Laurel is at the end of her rope.

				LAUREL
		Look, Stud, I don't know how many more
		times I'm going to get to tell you this.
		There's something --

She points, sharply, at the examination table directly in front of her.

				LAUREL (CONT'D)
		-- that you have to help me with.

Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out.  He starts to
reach for his gun.

INT. MORGUE - CORRIDOR - DAY

Kay raises another lit match to his cigarette, but as this one gets close,
a BIG GLOB OF GOO drops from the ceiling and onto the match, dousing the
flame.

Kay looks up, sharply.

Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the
ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen
look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand.

From inside the morgue, Laurel SCREAMS.

INT. MORGUE - DAY

Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the
air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it.

Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy
Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his
shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own.

				KAY
		Freeze it, Bug!

				JAY
		Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

				LAUREL
			(to Jay)
		CHRIST, are you THICK!

				JAY
		How was I supposed to know!?!

				LAUREL
		What did I have to do, SING it for you!?!

				JAY
		Maybe if you didn't come on like a drunken
		prom date!

				LAUREL
		Oh, that's SO typical. Any time a woman
		shows the slightest hint of sexual
		independence, men just --

				EDGAR
		Everybody shut UP!

				KAY
		Let her go, Shit Eater.

				EDGAR
		Listen, Monkey Boy, I may have to take that
		kind of talk in my end of the universe, but
		compared to you humans, I'm the top rung on
		the evolutionary ladder, so can it, all
		right?!

				KAY
		You're breakin' my heart. Move six inches
		to your left and I'll solve all your
		problems.

ORION the cat suddenly attacks, leaping off the top of the cabinet and
landing on Edgar, HISSING and scratching and clawing for all she's worth.
Edgar snaps an arm up and whips her off. The cat squirms in his arm, the
icon jangling. Edgar grabs the icon, holds onto it, and flings the cat
away, across the morgue. The icon comes free, remaining in his hand.

He drops it into his mouth and swallows. He shoves the gun hard against
Laurel's cheek.

				EDGAR
		That's better. Now put down your weapons.
		We're leaving.

Kay freezes, teeth clenched, gun still in front of him. Standoff.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		Have you ever pulled the wings off a fly?

Edgar cranks one of Laurel's arms behind her back, hard, and she CRIES OUT
in pain.

				EDGAR (CONT'D)
		Would you care to see the fly get even?

				KAY
		How far you think you'll get without your
		ship? If that's what you call that hunk of
		space crap we've got back at our office.

				EDGAR
		Put the weapons down!

				KAY
		Never gonna happen, Insect.

Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass
window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance,
slowly, cornering him.

				JAY
		It's okay, Laurel!

				LAUREL
		HOW is it okay?!

				JAY
		I mean it's going to be okay!

				EDGAR
		Don't bet on it, meat sack.

And with that he turns, leaps --

-- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft.

EXT. MORGUE (SIDE STREET) - DUSK

EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing.

Nobody looks twice as Edgar, dragging Laurel (with his arm over her
mouth), races toward the nearby busy Manhattan Street.

INT. MORGUE - AIR SHAFT - DUSK

Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and
the walls are smooth anyway.

				KAY
		Damn it!

They turn and run out of the morgue.

EXT. THE NEARBY BUSY MANHATTAN STREET - DUSK

EDGAR, with LAUREL, RUNS right in front of a CAB, which screeches to a
halt inches from them. The CABBIE sticks his head out and YELLS something
in an unknown language. And KEEPS yelling as --

Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door
(cigarette and wooden seat-beads and all).

The Cab Driver is still yelling as Edgar leaps in, pushing Laurel in
before him, leaving her behind the wheel.

He removes a POSTCARD -- the one he took from the display on the
newsstand.

				EDGAR
		Take me here.

				LAUREL
		What???

Edgar just cranks the car into gear -- opening his mouth and swallowing
the icon -- and in so doing revealing a TRIPLE ROW OF SERRATED BUG-TEETH,
he SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.

Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward. She has no choice, but
to grab the wheel and start steering as --

The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to
make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car
as it straightens and heads into the traffic.

The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears
around the corner.

A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere
to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads, the
ripped pine-scented green deodorizer, and the still-burning cigarette.

				JAY
		They're in a cab.

And Jay starts running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting
at the intersection.  He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows,
scaring the living shit out of people --

				JAY
		Hey! Laurel!? Hey!

-- but Laurel and Edgar are nowhere to be found. Up ahead the light turns
green and the tide of taxis wash away, leaving Jay on the street. He turns
as a car screeches up behind him, its headlights shining in his eyes. As
it gets closer, Jay sees it's Kay in the LTD.

				KAY
		Stop wasting time. He's not getting off the
		planet in a cab.

								CUT TO:

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head
toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in
frenetic activity in response to the threat from above.

				KAY
			(to tech at a desk)
		Come with me. Put up a bio-net all the way
		around Manhattan; if it's not human, it's
		not leaving the island.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		What've we got from our friends upstairs?

				ZED
		Same thing: "Deliver the galaxy."

				KAY
		Yeah, well the bug's got the galaxy, but
		we've got his ship. He's got to be looking
		for a way out.

Just then, a loud ALARM wails.

AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian
ship, striking a region of planet earth.

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

-- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going
off.

				JAY
		WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY SHOOTING AT US FOR?!

				ZED
		Arquillian battle rules, kid. First we get
		an ultimatum, then a warning shot, then we
		have a galactic standard week to respond.

				JAY
		A galactic standard week? How the hell long
		is that?

				KAY
		One hour.

				JAY
		One hour?

Viewing the screen, it now reads:
				    MIB
                            DELIVER THE GALAXY
                     OR THE EARTH WILL BE DESTROYED...
                                   SORRY

				ZED
		To keep the bugs from getting it, the
		Arquillians will destroy the galaxy and
		whatever planet it's on.

				JAY
		You're talking about US!

				ZED
		Sucks, doesn't it?

				KAY
		Pull up the locations of all land-based
		interstellar vehicles.

				ZED
		They're all gone. Frank the Pug took the
		last ship on the planet.

As Kay and Zed watch as the machine scrolls through the data, Jay walks
back towards the center of the room, deep in thought. Over him we hear:

				KAY
		Atlantic City?

				ZED
		Gone.

				KAY
		That landfill on the Jersey Shore?

				ZED
		Gone.

				JAY
		Uh, gentlemen.

				KAY
		Epcot?

				ZED
		Gone.

				KAY
		Miami Beach?

				ZED
		Gone.

				JAY
		Fellas.

				KAY
		Hartford?

				ZED
		Gone, thank God.

				JAY
		Hey. Old guys.

Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Do those still work?

They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall
in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the
enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the
mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped
by --

-- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand
there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we --

							DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

-- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing
Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards
away. EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind
her, still holding his weapon on her.

				EDGAR
		You're coming with me.

				LAUREL
		What?! Why?!

				EDGAR
		It's a long trip. I'll need a snack.

And he shoves her ahead of him, off in the direction of the space ships.

Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the
front of the postcard he's been carrying around. "FLUSHING MEADOWS, SITE
OF THE 1964 WORLD'S FAIR," it says, with a distinctive photograph of the
spaceships.

So that's how he knew.

EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - NIGHT

Nighttime now, and the city hums along, just another Thursday night.  The
clock in Columbus Circle says it's 7:45.

EXT. SIXTH AVENUE - NIGHT

TVs in the window of an appliance store show a rerun of "Cheers." PEOPLE
laugh.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

The news ticker in Times Square announces the latest shattering news:
		RAIN LIKELY -- TEMPS DROP TO 60'S

EARTHLINGS pass left and right, blissfully unaware of their impending
doom.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT

KAY and JAY leap into Kay's LTD and SLAM the doors. Kay jams the key in
the ignition, the car ROARS to life, and he turns to Jay.

				KAY
		Whaddya say we bag us some bug?

He hits the gas and the car ROCKETS away from the curb.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The LTD tears through the city.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Kay turns sharply to the right, SMACKING Jay around. Looking up ahead, he
sees the entrance to the midtown tunnel.

				JAY
		You're taking the tunnel?!

				KAY
		You know a better way to Queens?

				JAY
		It's usually jammed?!

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - NIGHT

The LTD races through the tunnel at top speed. It's clear driving for a
few seconds, but then they round a bend --

-- and there's a traffic jam up ahead.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Kay approaches the line of cars at top speed, with no intention of slowing
down. Jay, terrified, holds on for dear life.

				JAY
		I told you!

				KAY
		Jay. The button?

				JAY
		Yeah?!

				KAY
		Push the button, Jay.

A LIGHTED PANEL rotates into place between the two front seats, and that
red button flashes underneath its plastic shield again. Jay flips back the
plastic cover and JAMS his finger down on the red flashing button.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		And you may want to throw on a seat belt.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - MIB LTD - NIGHT

As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve,
its shape actually changing. The sides and back extend as some sort of
endoskeleton pushes the "normal" panels out. It becomes a larger, wirier
machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and
metallic tendons.

Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last
possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from
underneath it.

Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to
it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic
below.

It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels
clinging to the roof of the tunnel.

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Jay falls from his seat with a CLUNK, onto the upside down ceiling of the
car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they
tear through the tunnel, ZOOMING over the bottlenecked traffic underneath.

As they race through the tunnel, they have a minute to kill.

				KAY
		Mind if I smoke?

				JAY
		What?!?

				KAY
		In the car, I mean.

				JAY
		I don't care!!

				KAY
		Hey, just a common courtesy. It bothers
		some people if you smoke in a car.

He lights a cigarette and blows the smoke out leisurely, one hand on the
wheel, just waiting out the tunnel. Jay gives up struggling to right
himself and closes his eyes, suffering through this.

EXT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

From outside the car, we watch it rocket along on the roof of the tunnel.
We can hear KAY'S VOICE as he goes on. And on.

				KAY
		Yeah, it's harder and harder to smoke
		anywhere these days. Hell, I suppose I
		should quit. I've tried. Never took,
		though. I'm beginning to think I lack
		self-control.

And they disappear out the other end of the tunnel --

INT. MIB LTD - TRAVELING - NIGHT

-- and flip over, BANGING back down onto the road on the other side. Jay
falls off the ceiling and SLAMS into his seat.

				KAY
		Well, back to work.

He flips his cigarette out the window and cranks the wheel to the left.

EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - TOLL BOOTH - NIGHT

Approaching a toll booth, the LTD shoots across nine lanes of traffic and
through the only open booth, SHATTERING the gate. Traveling at about two
hundred miles an hour, Kay nonchalantly flips a token out the window --

-- and it CHINKS in the basket as their taillights disappear.

								CUT TO:

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - LANDING TOWER - NIGHT

EDGAR climbs the outside of the landing tower of one of the space ships,
pushing LAUREL up ahead of him, headed for the saucer at the top.

				LAUREL
		Come on, let me go, you don't want to eat
		me. I'm a very important person on my
		planet. Like a queen. A goddess, even.
		There are those who worship me, yes. I'm
		not trying to impress you with this, I'm
		just letting you know. It could start a
		war.

				EDGAR
		Good. War means food for my family, all
		seventy-eight million of them. That's a lot
		of mouths to feed, your highness.

				LAUREL
		You're a wonderful dad.

And with that she KICKS him squarely in the face. He reels, momentarily
losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and FLINGS
HERSELF out, into the air.

Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the
air --

-- and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches
rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the
ground.

Above, Edgar just keeps climbing.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the
fairgrounds.

AT THE TRUNK, JAY and KAY flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever
weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, UNSNAPS a row of
latches, and opens it, revealing --

-- the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet.

Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump
action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The
shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up
the clip.

				JAY
		You know how to work that?

Kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence.

				KAY
		No idea whatsoever.

He SLAMS the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their
columns in the distance.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Let's bag us some bug.

As if on cue, one of the saucers begins to HUM. Then it starts to spin,
faster and faster. The ship begins to rise.

				JAY
		Oh, shit.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - TREE - NIGHT

Laurel sits in her tree, watching with amazement.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM - NIGHT

At Shea Stadium, a Mets game is in progress. Behind the home plate side,
the flying saucer silently rises up in the night sky, plainly visible.

But at that very moment, the batter CRACKS into a fastball, hard. The
crowd rises to its feet, SHOUTING, staring out at center field, where the
ball is headed.

All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his
eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen,
his jaw drops --

-- and the catchable ball sails over his head, THUDDING into the wall
behind him. The crowd BOOS viciously.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Kay raises the weapon he took from the trunk; looks over at Jay.

				KAY
		Set it to pulsar level five, sub-sonic
		implosion factor --

				JAY
		What?

				KAY
		Press the little green button, on three.

Jay raises his weapon; they press their green buttons.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		One...two...

They pull their triggers.

For a moment, nothing happens, as if it were a misfire. But then, there is
a VACUUM WHUMP, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a
space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the
barrel of the guns.

Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, THUDDING to
their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship,
then it HITS the ship --

-- and it too is sucked back down. Hurtling back toward them.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She flinches as the flying saucer shoots overhead.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The saucer CRASHES through the Unisphere, an enormous steel globe, and
THUDS to the earth, CRASHING through brush, dirt and rock...

Jay and Kay come to their feet...

In front of them, the dust clears... Trees uprooted, stones and dirt
thrown everywhere...a dumpster has been cast to their left...

And the saucer is there, embedded in the earth, tipped off-kilter in a
mound of debris...

A hatch comes up...revealing Edgar, walking slowly toward them, with
contained fury.

				EDGAR
		You don't get it. I've won. It's over.

				KAY
		You are under arrest for violating number
		4-1-53 of the Tycho accord. Please hand
		over any galaxy you might be carrying.

				EDGAR
		You milk-suckers! You don't matter! In a
		few seconds you won't even be matter!

				KAY
		Move away from the vehicle and put your
		hands on your head.

He pumps the gun for emphasis.

				EDGAR
		Put my hands on my head?

Edgar stares at him. Then flexes his arms, still encased in flesh. His
giant pincers RIP free of the rotting skin.

He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be
twelve feet across.

Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They
BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug
raises himself aloft on his legs.

He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes
the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of
cloth and skin, and finally

Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now
reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly
tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a
small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.

He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. The GALAXY
hangs on a chain around his neck.

				BUG
		Like this?

Kay and Jay pump their guns and aim at the Bug.

Suddenly the Bug SPITS. And a HUGE, SLIMY WAD OF GOO shoots from him and
engulfs both shotguns. The Bug snorts it back, tearing them from Jay and
Kay's grasp, then swallowing them.

Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --

The Bug SWIPES at them with the back of his clawed hand, like someone
brushing aside a gnat -- and SENDS THEM FLYING FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She flinches as she sees them hit the ground. She starts to climb the
tree.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Jay and Kay hit the ground with loud grunts.

				JAY
		That did not go at all like I had planned.

They look up to see the Bug moving for the second tower -- and the second
flying saucer. Kay gets to his feet.

				KAY
		This guy's really starting to bug me.

Kay starts walking after the Bug.

				KAY
		Whatever happens, Jay, don't let him get on
		that ship.

				JAY
		Where are you going?

				KAY
		Getting my gun back.

				JAY
		What!?

Kay steps forward and yells at the departing Bug.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		Hey, Bug!

The Bug just keeps moving toward the ladder.

				KAY (CONT'D)
		I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many
		of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off
against the giant alien hug.

EXT. LAUREL'S TREE - NIGHT

She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the
woods.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT

Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's
face.

				KAY
		You're just a smear on the sports page to
		me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal
		parasite! Eat me!

The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS,
lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth.

The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay
slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS
his way down into its abdomen.

JAY looks on, in stunned horror...

AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a
HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

Laurel is still watching.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT

Jay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally
defeated. But...

He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach...

CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach,
we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just
a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY!

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the
gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete
dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.

				JAY
		Hey! Come over here and try that!

The concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just
keeps moving.

Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.

				JAY
		Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on
		your waxy, pointed ass!

Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole.

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on
the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at
Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass.

The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay --

-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the
grass.

Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in
the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a
dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently
vulnerable underbelly, right above him.

He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up,
into the Bug's gut, when;

The Bug bends its head down between its legs.

BUG'S POV of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between
the Bug's legs.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

The Bug opens its jaws and SNAPS at Jay -- who propels himself backward
out of harm's way.

The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.

				JAY
		What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand
		and fight like an arthropod!

In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto
its back, trying to drag it down.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe
		you're a badass in your hive, but this is
		New York City. You're just another tourist
		here!

The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him SAILING twenty feet
through the air.

Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.

But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at
the Bug, extending his arm at the creature.

				JAY
		You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --

He notices something on his arm...a cockroach running down his sleeve. He
flicks it off...

Looks down at the ground...sees another roach...looks over to the dumpster
behind him...there are more of them...a whole mob, in fact...fifty or
sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster...

Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the
side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling
like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...

Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects...

				JAY
		Hey, Bug!

CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach.  CRUNCH.

ON THE BUG as he flinches on the ladder -- he hates that sound.

ON JAY. He smiles.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of
		yours.

He knows he's getting to him. He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot
over another roach.

CRUNCH! He crushes another one.

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Whoa! That had to hurt. And, what d'you
		know, here's your old Uncle Bob!

He steps forward again -- CRUNCH!

ON THE BUG. He turns around, anger burning in his eyes.

INT. BUG - NIGHT

Kay's hand reaches closer and closer to the gun...

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON JAY - NIGHT

Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds
his foot over another one.

				JAY
		What's that? Can you hear what he's saying?
		'Help me! Help me!'

CRUNCH. [ON] THE BUG as he starts climbing down the tower and moving
toward Jay.

ON JAY. They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on,
poising his foot over another roach.

				JAY
		Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks
		kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who
		that is!

The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.

				BUG
		Don't do that!

Jay stares right back at the Bug. Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing
around the trigger of the shotgun. He brings it around, pointing up,
straight at the Bug's head.

				JAY
		That's your Momma!

He moves to CRUNCH the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares
up at him, unflinching...

				JAY (CONT'D)
		Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off
		more than you can chew?

and at that very moment...

Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front
of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.

The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head
flying behind Jay.

Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping
the atomizer from his slippery fingers.

The other gun sails off into the darkness.

The ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to
rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.

He calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay.

				JAY
		You son of a --

Kay holds up a finger in a 'wait a minute' gesture -- pulls out his pocket
phone and hits a number.

				KAY
		Zed. Get a message to the Arquillians.  We
		have the galaxy.

INT. MIB HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Zed is standing at the console, a smile on his face. He glances over at
the console that displays alien arrivals and departures on the earth. The
red lights are coming back on.

				ZED
		I think the word's already out. Our friends
		are coming back.
			(then)
		Got an authorized landing at Times Square.
		You and Jay check it out on the way back...
		And pick me up one of those soft pretzels,
		while you're at it. Extra salt. I feel like
		celebrating.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT

Kay flips the phone closed.

				KAY
		You were saying?

				JAY
		Getting eaten!? That was your plan!?

				KAY
			(shrugs)
		Worked.

As they argue, behind them, unseen, THE FRONT HALF OF THE BUG RAISES
ITSELF UP on its forearms, eyes gleaming with hate, jaws dripping -- ready
to lower itself onto Kay and Jay.

				JAY
		After I got the shit beat out of me!

				KAY
		And I almost got digested. It goes with the
		job.

				JAY
		You coulda told me what you were doing.

				KAY
		There wasn't time, sport!

HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see
it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads...

BOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down
everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.

They turn to see...

LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the
barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards.

				LAUREL
		Interesting job you guys got.

ON THE SKY. Bits of Bug juice still flying through the air.

INT. A CAR ON THE ADJOINING FREEWAY - NIGHT

The driver sees something tumbling toward the windshield. He winces.

-- AND THE BUG'S REMAINS SPLAT AGAINST THE WINDSHIELD.

The driver grimaces at the mess.

				DRIVER
		Damn bugs.

He reaches down and hits a button. Wiper fluid squirts onto the windshield
and the wipers spread the bug goo everywhere.

								CUT TO:

EXT. MIB BUILDING - NIGHT

Kay's LTD is parked outside Men in Black headquarters. LAUREL leans her
back against the car.  We see JAY and KAY walking away in the distance.

				JAY
		Look, I know we got rules, but she did just
		bust the Bug for us.  And so maybe you
		don't have to flashy thing her.

Kay pulls out the neuralyzer.

				JAY
		Who's she gonna tell, anyway? She only
		hangs out with dead people.

				KAY
		Not her. Me.
			(looking up at the sky)
		They're beautiful, aren't they? The stars.
		I never just look anymore and they're
		beautiful.

				JAY
		Kay, you're scaring your partner.

				KAY
		I haven't been training a partner -- I've
		been training a replacement.

				JAY
		Oh no, I can't do this job by myself.

				LAUREL
			(walking towards them)
		Hey, guys, we're nowhere near my apartment.
		We're not even on the right island.

				KAY
		Maybe you won't have to.

Kay starts dialing back the neuralyzer.

				KAY
		Days. Months. Years. Always face it
		forwards.

He hands the neuralyzer to Jay. Taps his pocket. Indicates for him to put
his glasses on. Jay resists.

				KAY
		I've just been down the gullet of an
		interstellar cockroach. That's one of a
		hundred memories I don't want.

Jay takes the neuralyzer. Slips on his glasses.

				KAY
		See you around, sport.

Jay raises the neuralyzer. With a brilliant FLASH, the screen turns white.

				JAY
		No, you won't.

CLOSE ON various tabloid headlines as a hand flicks through them. Here's
one:
			 Mets' Centerfielder Says:
		     "UFO MADE ME MISS HOME RUN BALL!"
And here's another one:
		    DETROIT HAS CAR THAT DEFIES GRAVITY!
			Secret Tests in N.Y.'s Tunnel
And a third:
			MAN AWAKENS FROM 30-YEAR COMA
		        Returns to Girl He Left Behind

A large photograph shows a smiling KAY, arm-in-arm with ELIZABETH RESTON,
his long-lost fiancee, in her back yard in Tempe, Arizona.

She holds a large bouquet of flowers, the same kind he brought but never
gave her thirty years ago.

JAY, who's reading the paper, smiles.

AT THE CURB, Jay hurries back to the LTD with the newspapers. ELLE,
(formerly Laurel), is waiting, leaning against the hood. Tailored black
suit. Black shoes. Short-cropped hair. The look never looked better.

				ELLE
		Zed called. The High Consulate of Regent-9
		emissary wants floor seats to the Knicks --
		Bulls game.

				JAY
		I'll talk to Dennis Rodman, it's his damn
		planet.

				ELLE
		Let's roll.

Both car doors SLAM, Jay drops it in gear, and the LTD BLASTS away from
the curb.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY BLOCK - DAY

The LTD is just one of many cars in a jam-packed Manhattan city block.

FROM UP IN THE CLOUDS

Manhattan itself is just part of a much larger urban and suburban sprawl.

FROM THE STRATOSPHERE

The east coast of the United States is just part of a much larger land
mass.

FROM THE EOSPHERE

North America is just a small portion of the planet Earth.

FROM SPACE

Earth is just a tiny ball in our solar system.

FROM THE MIDDLE OF THE MILKY WAY

Our solar system is just a few blips of light in a vast star field.

FROM OUTSIDE OUR GALAXY

The Milky Way is just a creamy spiral amid innumerable other creamy
spirals.

FROM THE OUTER REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE

There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to
close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists
seems to be contained in one tiny ball --

-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red
dirt.

An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering
and bouncing across the dirt, where it CLICKS into a dozen other big blue
balls just like it.

				FADE OUT.

          CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

          Standard issue throughout the south to abusive, racist prison
          guards.

          Widen to reveal that, indeed, these glasses are on the
          sneering face of just such a man.
          We follow the guard

          DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY

          Paint peeling off the rusty bars. Somewhere, someone is
          playing harmonica. Prisoners yell complaints as he passes.
          He meets them all with--

                         GUARD
          Shut up, convict! Get yer hands
          off the bars!

          The guard passes through several levels of security doors,
          deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison --
          home of the scum of the scum.
          Meanwhile...

          PRISON VISITING ROOM

          The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
          magazines, watch TV. Footsteps -- someone's here. Which
          pisses them off, because that means they actually have to do
          their jobs.

          The unseen visitor buzzes for help. They take their time
          getting off their asses. When they finally look up, their
          gaze becomes a leer. Follow it to:
          DEVIL GIRL, the visitor. Too tall, too muscled, but hot if
          you're into that kind of thing -- an R. Crumb drawing come to
          life.

          She holds a CAKE -- the cutest, perfectly-frosted pink cake
          right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook.

                         GUARD 2
          Lookie here. Yaz's visitor. I
          guess even a turd gets flies to
          land on it.

                         GUARD 3
          Me, I like a big girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.
          They smirk, hoping for a reaction. Devil girl emits a low,
          sinister growl like an angry Doberman... The guards look at
          each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS:

                         GUARD 2
          I.D., visitation papers.

          BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD
          He reaches the end of the hallway. The biggest, most
          absurdly-reinforced double security door. He punches in a
          code.
          The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
          squeaking and groaning the whole way. Whoever's behind this
          thing must've done something REAL bad.

          WITH DEVIL GIRL
          Going through the metal detectors, waved over with security
          wands. The guards are being thorough. Maybe more thorough
          than they need to be. They check everything -- even the
          cake. The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED.

                         GUARD 3
          She's clean. Well, not CLEAN, but
          you know.
          They laugh, buzz her through.

          WITH THE GUARD
          The giant door finally opens, he continues to the end of the
          hallway. Stops in front of a cell. Yells in:

                         GUARD
          Hey, Yaz! You got a visitor.
          Let's go, pretty boy.

                         VISITING ROOM
          Spare. Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
          concrete. Nothing a convict could, say, smash into the face
          of a guard.
          The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards -- looks
          like they're not taking chances.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.
          At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake. She
          hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

                         BELOVED --
          YAZ, an evil hippie/biker badass right out of Easy Rider. A
          huge mane of hair, a big handlebar moustache that frames a
          grubby unshaven face...
          Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
          every strand of hair, every fringe on his dirty jacket -- the
          way Elvis was in his prime.
          He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING. A smirk plays on
          his mouth that says -- I'm smarter than you, asshole.
          The guards escort Yaz, who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
          MANACLES. They dump him into one of the chairs. Devil Girl
          jumps up, they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long.
          A guard pokes them with his billy club --

                         GUARD 2
          This ain't a conjugal visit.
          quit yer conjugating.

                         YAZ
          When's the last time you conjugated
          anything?

                         DEVIL GIRL
          I brought you a cake.

                         YAZ
          Thanks, darling.

                         (TO GUARDS)
          Hey could you cut this up for us?
          It's our anniversary. I'm romantic
          like that.
          A guard picks up the cake. Smirks and takes a dirty three-
          fingered scoop of frosting.

                         GUARD 2

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Not great. She must.be good at
          somethin' else.
          They all LAUGH. He goes back for another scoop.

                         YAZ
          I wouldn't do that.

                         GUARD 2
          Why's that, convict?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         GUARD POV:
          Where he scraped away the frosting, REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN

                         MOUTH

                         GUARD 2 (CONT'D)

                         WHAT TH--
          But in a flash, the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
          VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they
          consume the guard's entire face.

                         YAZ
          That's why.
          The aliens jump into Yaz's hands like a matching pair of
          grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
          their master, snarling and hungry for blood.
          The guards draw their weapons, but YAZ IS FASTER.-- he
          launches his aliens, taking them all out.
          Yaz "holsters" the aliens and...

          THE PRISON BREAK IS ON!!
          One guard, badly wounded, crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
          In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
          glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
          weapon.
          She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
          his chains.

                         YAZ
          There's nothing sexier than a girl
          killing for me.

          She runs a hand over his bicep.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You got so strong in prison.

          Yaz notices the almost-dead guard:

                         YAZ
          I'm not just a man of brute force,
          you know. I prefer to be known for
          my rapier wit--
          His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
          impaling the guard--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         YAZ (CONT'D)
          --and tongue.
          The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS.
          They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to saw
          open the door.

          YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
          Prisoners go nuts, guards scramble -- smoke, screaming,
          chaos.
          Yaz and Devil Girl, armed with weapons they took off the dead
          guards, BLAST THEIR WAY OUT.
          He's a sociopathic badass... and she's no slouch either.
           Along the way, Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
          an armload of weapons -- Shotguns, pistols, and a Rocket-
          Propelled grenade (RPG).
          He uses and discards them as he goes.
          They head for the front gate and FREEDOM...
          But..
          They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
          Plexiglass shields, helmets, shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz.
          All Yaz has left is his RPG.

          GUARD ON MEGAPHONE
          Give it up, Yaz! There's no way
          out!
          A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
          the 50 Guards... No one blinking...
          Prisoners. watching... what's gonna go down?

                         GUARD
          You can't win. You've only got one
          shot in there!
          Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it. The
          guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear.

                         YAZ
          You look hot. Mind if I open a
          window?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          The guards share a look - huh?? Yaz grins, turns his RPG
          towards the wall behind the guards. The guards' faces go

          WIDE WITH TERROR.

                         GUARD
          Hey! Whoa! What are you doing?
          Don't do that!

          SLAM!
          Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
          SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane.
          What the...?
          Yaz steps through the hole.

                         ON YAZ
          As he and Devil girl step through the hole, take a deep,
          satisfied breath of FREEDOM.
          Reveal we are on...

          THE SURFACE OF THE MOON
          The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF

          CORRECTIONS, LUNAR DIVISION
          Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH, smiles.
          As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet, his hair, his fringes
          INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZ'S MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS... they
          also seem drawn here. Like bees, they express a collective
          intelligence.

                         YAZ
          I'm coming for you...
          Following Yaz's gaze to the Earth, we launch into...

                         CREDITS
          MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy.
          Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET
          As it revolves, we observe its strange craters and surface,
          where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases...

          KAY'S VOICE (V.0.)
          When you really think about it, the
          universe is a pretty awful place.
          Full of danger, brutality, and ten
          million kinds of scum. So the
          trick is to find one or two things
          that make life in this cesspool
          worth living.
          And reveal we are actually looking at...

                         PEKING DUCK
          Rotating on a spit.
          JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate.

                         JAY
          That? That nasty, greasy thing
          makes your life worth living?
          There's people eating here, younger
          than that duck.

                         KAY
          I was talking about the noodles.
          Best noodles in town.
          And we are in

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN, NYC - NIGHT

          Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish. An eclectic NY
          crowd eats -- Wall Street guys, hipsters, a Chinese family or
          two, a couple of NYU professor types who love the
          "authenticity" of this place.
          KAY flashes a badge to the OWNER, Chinese.

          Why are you busting my balls, Jay?

          KAY (O.S.)
          Jay, take a look at this.
          Wu protests, Jay blows by him.

          Jay taps on the glass -- the fish SNARLS, making Jay JUMP.

          Look, Wu. You can serve it to
          your... out of town guests, but
          locals get earth fish. REAL earth
          fish. The kind that doesn't jump
          out of their stomach and get
          everyone asking a lot of annoying
          questions. Like, "Why is my lunch
          eating Daddy?" You got it?

                         KAY
          Aren't you forgetting something?

          INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Wu walks them to a table, seats them.

          MR. WU
          (for benefit of customers)
          Allow me most honorable benefit of
          get you noodles.

                         (FOR GUYS)
          Be right back, guys.
          Wu walks off. Jay CLOCKS the other diners.

                         JAY
          Something about this strike you as
          weird?

                         KAY
          Yeah, look -- clean fork.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         JAY
          Look at table two over there. They
          haven't ordered a thing. When's
          the last time Wu let someone sit at
          a table without ordering? And
          table five over there just drank
          his third cup of duck sauce.
          Now Kay's radar is up --

                         KAY
          Come to think of it... Why is Wu
          getting our noodles... outside?

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          Wu, at the door, closes the blinds. He catches them looking.

          MR. WU
          Sorry, guys.
          Wu leaves, quickly pulling the door behind, him. The guys
          reach for their weapons.
          And IT GOES DOWN --
          It's a SET-UP, and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --
          The hipsters, the families, the wall street guys -- all draw
          various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
          It's like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping
          truckloads of ordnance at each other. Close hand-to-hand
          combat. Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and they're not
          taking any chances.
          Right ahead of the onslaught, JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
          He nods, and they dive in opposite directions, SAVING

          THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT.
          But not for long...
          An explosive lands between them --
          Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW, rolls to a stop in the
          middle of the

                         DESERTED STREET
          Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a
          motorcycle. As he pulls into the light -- YAZI

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          Kay's eyes go wide with recognition.
          Yaz grins a murderous grin...

                         YAZ
          Some things are worth waiting for.

                         KAY
          Then come get it, you worthless

                         PIECE OF--
          Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY.

          INSIDE WITH JAY
          Getting the worst of it.
          A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN.
          The Giant fish's tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE! And he
          goes RIGHT AFTER JAY!

                         JAY
          You probably took that whole
          catfish thing the wrong way --
          The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES!

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I was jealous, you know? Because
          you're so pretty!
          Jay BATTLES THE FISH-- throwing pots and pans in its mouth,
          squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it

                         AT BAY--

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay! KAY!!! Little help! Little
          help!

          OUTSIDE WITH KAY
          Yaz getting closer. He pulls out a CANNON of a gun, fires
          into the air.

                         YAZ
          This time you don't have your
          friends to tell you what happens
          next.

                         KAY
          Oh, I know what happens next.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.
          Kay draws his EQUALLY BADASS-LOOKING WEAPON --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          I've been waiting forty years for
          another shot at you, scum.
          Kay takes aim and... CLICK! Empty.

          Sorry you're having trouble! If
          you survive this encounter, please

          Kay throws the gun at Yaz.
          Yaz laughs. Gets Kay in his sights.

                         YAZ
          All I wanted was justice, Kay.
          Justice for my brothers. But you
          had to meddle, didn't you?

                         KAY
          They deserved what they got.

                         YAZ
          Why don't you say that to their
          faces when you see them...
          Puts the barrel in Kay's face and BOOM!!!
          Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION!!
          Reveal Jay, just fired the shot.
           Jay looks like total hell, beaten up, covered with 8 kinds of
          slime and alien guts.
          He stumbles over to Kay, who in contrast looks perfectly
          pressed.

                         JAY
          So I was thinking about making a
          chart for each time I save your
          ass. And when I do it ten times,
          you buy me lunch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          Kay lets out a long, weary sigh.

                         KAY
          Will you settle for a drink?

          INT. DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANT

          Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers. Jay is
          on his phone.

                         JAY

                         (INTO PHONE)
          We're gonna need a cleanup on the
          corner of Canal and Mott. And
          bring a net. Biggest one you've
          got.
          Follow Jay's gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down Canal.
          Jay and Kay back in their booth, Jay grabs a couple noodles
          off another table and starts eating.
          Through the scene, various MiB clean-up crew people work the
          crime scene.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Why aren't you eating?

                         (GETS NOTHING)
          So what the hell was that guy?
          Kay's quiet. Ominously quiet. Weighing his words:

                         KAY
          Yaz. Put him away a long time ago.
          Biggest mistake I ever made.

                         JAY
          Why? Was he the wrong guy?

                         KAY
          No. Should've killed him.

                         JAY
          Yeah, well, don't worry, I think I
          took care of him.

                         KAY
          That was too easy.

                         JAY
          I make it look easy. That's the
          problem with being my partner.

          14.

                         JAY (CONTD)
          You get used to my game. It's what
          Dr. Phil would call taking for
          granted.

                         KAY
          You don't get it, hoss. This guy
          is different. Worse than anyone.
          He tried to blow up the Earth but I
          stopped him. He developed a
          dislike for me and for certain
          behaviors of mine, such as being
          alive.

                         JAY
          C'mon, you know better {than anyone.
          What does an MiB agent call it when
          12 alien species try to kill him?
          Tuesday.
          Jay laughs at his own joke. Kay just stares.

                         KAY
          Maybe.
          (calling off to cleanup

                         GUYS)
          Make sure you get all of him, I
          mean it! He's an assembler!

                         CLEANUP GUY
          Yes, sir, Agent Kay.

                         JAY
          Seriously, man, those noodles'll
          kill you before he does. I got
          your back.

                         KAY
          I know you do.
          Stares at his noodles a while, like there's answers in there:

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          I used to play a game with my
          daddy. What would you want for
          your last meal. Could do worse
          than this.

                         JAY
          Oh, yeah? I used to play a game
          with my dad, too. Called catch.
          I'd throw the ball, and then it'd
          hit the house `cause he WASN'T

          THERE.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         KAY
          Do me a favor, don't badmouth your
          old man.

                         JAY
          Hard to badmouth someone you don't
          know.

                         (CHECKS HIMSELF)
          Alright, forget it. The past is
          the past. And right now we have
          something much more important to
          talk about. Bowling Night.

                         KAY
          I'm tired.

                         JAY
          Tired? What -- you afraid I'm
          gonna take that MVP trophy away
          from you?

                         KAY
          Petrified. See you later.
          Kay takes a few tired steps and turns back --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          And slick? Watch yourself. A guy
          like Yaz can come after you when
          you least expect it. Anywhere,
          anytime.
          Jay watches Kay walk away. Looks like he's carrying a heavy
          load. Turns his attention to the clean up crew:

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          What part of clean up everything
          don't you understand? There's a
          spleen on that car!

                         CLEANUP GUY
          On it, sir.

                         DARK ALLEY
          A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of... Devil Girl!
          She reaches down. We see -- a finger with the distinctive
          Skull, inching its way along the road.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          You okay, baby? Momma's got you.
          now.

          MIB HQ - LATER THAT NIGHT
          Jay at his desk -- papers and folders everywhere -- SEARCHING

          FOR SOMETHING.
          We see what he's looking through -- KAY'S OLD CASE FILES.

                         JAY
          Yaz... Yaz... Yaz... Where are you,
          Yaz...?
          And he FINDS IT!

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Here we go...
          Jay opens the YAZ INCIDENT REPORT

                         INSIDE:
          - Pictures of Yaz
          - A type-written report telling us YAZ APPREHENDED BY AGENT

          Reveal Zed in his ridiculous bowling outfit.

          BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT
          A sign says: CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT
          We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into

          INT. BOWLING ALLEY

          Safely inside, the Bowlers remove their heads -- which become
          their bowling balls.
          It's the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS. MIB AGENTS
          MiB agents and aliens say hi, exchange trash-talk.
          We see shots of games in progress:
          An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the lane,
          it sticks out arms, taking down all the pins.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          The aliens cheer, slap tentacles, clink beers and swallow
          them whole. A many-armed alien re-sets the pins.
          A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul
          line... and -- gutter ball! He gets mad and shoots the pins
          with his laser-eyes.
          We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM, NOT BOWLING BECAUSE

          THEY'RE WAITING FOR KAY --
          Zed paces, wearing way too much bowling regalia.

                         ZED
          Where's Kay? We either roll or
          forfeit -- and I didn't put this on
          to forfeit!

                         JAY
          Alright, Bowling Robot, do what we
          built you for.
          Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those
          white trash T-shirts that reads "10 reasons why Bowling is
          better than Women."

                         ROBOT

                         (ROBOT VOICE)
          This is my time to shine.
          Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor. An awkward
          beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors. Then a car
          alarm.

                         ROBOT (CONT'D)
          There goes my perfect game.

                         (ROBOT LAUGH)
          Ha ha ha.

                         JAY
          Guess it's on me.
          Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches, willing it towards
          the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY! But Jay's roll is
          too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a

          STRIKE!
          Jay and his teammates triumphant! The frame of a lifetime!
          Jay looks around --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Of course -- the one time Kay isn't
          here...

          Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear, like somebody
          who did some celebrating last night.
          We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT, RIDICULOUS MIB

          BOWLING TROPHY.

                         JAY
          Check it out--
          The trophy raises a triumphant fist -- we realize it is in
          fact AN ALIEN.

          We're number one! In your face!

          Big surprise, you win every year.

                         JAY
          I... huh?

          MIB HQ - HEADQUARTERS
          Jay, in a good mood, flaunts his trophy to everyone in the
          office. The trophy continues its stream of obnoxious trash
          talk.

                         JAY
          Where are you, Kay? I think you
          want to see this. It's the bowling
          MVP trophy with MY name on it.
          Jay works his way to his desk.
          Kay's already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his work,
          his back to Jay.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Maybe you want to think twice next
          time you ditch me.
          Kay, absorbed in work, doesn't answer.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay?

          KAY (O.S.)
          (back still to camera)
          Yeah?

                         JAY
          Yeah, I just wanted to show you
          this so I could say--

                         (SEEING HIM)
          Who the hell are YOU???

          You new around here?

                         " KAY"

                         (LAUGHS)
          Good one, partner.

                         JAY
          Yeah, okay, but I need the other
          Kay. You know, craggy old white
          guy... well, DIFFERENT craggy old
          white guy.
          I got you something.
          He hands over a "World's Best Partner" mug --

                         "KAY" (CONT'D)
          Have I told you today how much I
          appreciate working together?

                         JAY
          What the HELL is going on here?
          Why are you pretending to be Kay?

                         " KAY FR
          You seem upset. Let's go get some
          coffee and talk about our feelings.

                         JAY
          How about instead, you go find me
          THIS guy?
          Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY. But
          now, splashed across Kay's photo, the words:

          KILLED IN ACTION -- JULY 16, 1969

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.
          Jay stares at the photo --- in it, we notice Kay is NOW

          WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Killed? In 1969?
          Jay grabs the YAZ FILE -- the one he looked through last
          night -- but now everything is different.
          We see -- the incident report stating ONE CASUALTY - AGENT

          KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
          Jay can't believe it, he keeps reading...
          Snatches of the typewritten incident report
          The casualty report

          ONE CASUALTY... AGENT KAY, DEAD AT SCENE...
          A photo of Kay WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION.
          Jay stares, struck by this --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay's dead? How? Why?

          good ride.

          A GENERAL FREAK-OUT ENSUES
          Jay remains calm:

                         JAY
          Whoa, what's everyone freaking out
          about? We had one of these last
          week.
          "Kay" hides under a desk, weeping.

                         "KAY"
          We're all gonna die!

                         JAY
          Wait - what is everyone's problem?
          What about that pan-galactic
          missile shield thing?

                         ZED
          Sure, great idea, if we had one.

           COMPUTER (V.0.)

          I wanted to build one years ago,
          but Kay talked me out of it.

                         JAY
          Kay talked you out of it? Kay
          wouldn't do that. He's the most
          distrustful person in the galaxy.
          He personally set up that system to
          defend our planet from the scum of
          the universe.

          I thought we didn't have any
          enemies anymore. A stranger's just
          a friend you haven't met.

                         JAY
          Yeah, that's working out great.
          Look, I don't know what's frying
          everyone's brains, but I remember
          the missile shield --- Kay -- the
          real Kay -- loved that thing. He
          wouldn't shut up about it. I mean,
          that thing was all Kay.

                         (REALIZING)
          But Kay's dead. He's been dead for
          years. But I knew him yesterday.
           Jay looks at the YAZ file. Gears turning. He grabs a
          picture of Yaz --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Where the hell did he.get an iPhone
          in 1969?

          EXTREME CLOSE UP ON PICTURE --
          Peeking out of Yaz's jacket -- an iPhone.
          Something clicks --

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Kay said Yaz can get you anywhere,
          anytime. Any TIME. So Yaz killed
          Kay in 1969 and now there's no
          missile shield.
          Jay realizes something and RUNS OFF

                         OKAY"
          I love you, Jay!

          He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end:

          On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively.
          Jay runs off with purpose...

          STREETS OF NYC
          July in the city. A perfect summer day. Kids eat ice cream.
          Old ladies head to matinees. The streets of New York team
          with humanity, blissfully unaware that they are about to die.
          In other words, a Tuesday.
          Jay runs through Time Square, where guys sell stuff on
          blankets.
          Desperately looking for someone...
          Among the sellers, a suspicious-looking guy wearing a strange
          mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat.
          As soon as he sees Jay, his eyes go wide and HE FLEES.
          Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays
          him out.

                         JAY
          Where you going in such a hurry,
          Obadiah? The past?

          He throws his arms up, revealing a pocket watch and a
          telescope.

                         JAY
          I know you've been time-travelling.

          I'm legit.

                         JAY
          Yeah? What's this?
          Reveal the thing he just hit him with -- a ship's bell with
          S.S. TITANIC on it.

                         OBADIAH
          I swear, I'm out of that. That's
          my grandmother's.

          Off a Dodo in a cage.

                         JAY
          Interesting.
          Jay picks up Spider-Man 8 off the blanket. Featuring
          chubby, bald 50-year-old Tobey Maguire.

                         OBADIAH
          That's pirated, man. That ain't
          nothing.
          Jay rips open his jacket --

          And this?
          Reveal a copy of the Declaration of Independence..

                         OBADIAH
          Okay, okay, maybe I've been time
          travelling a little -- just for
          personal use, man, just enough to

                         GET BY--

                         JAY
          Listen -- I'll look the other way
          if you tell me who's selling time
          travel these days. I just want
          your supplier.

                         OBADIAH
          No way, man. You don't mess with
          that guy. He'll kill you, me, and
          then he'll go after our families!

                         JAY
          Don't worry, he won't have time.

                         OBADIAH
          What do you mean?
          Jay forces the guy to look up-- we see the missiles.

                         JAY
          Those hit the sun in 8 minutes.
          You want to live out those minutes?
          Or you want me to take you out of
          your misery?
          Jay picks up an ancient weapon -- crossbow, blunderbuss --
          off the blanket and puts it to the criminal's head.

                         OBADIAH
          Okay, okay, but don't say I didn't
          warn you, man. You just signed
          your own death warrant.

                         JAY
          I just want a name.

                         OBADIAH
          Fine, but it's the last one you'll
          ever hear.

          It'll only take a minute. You see,
          my nanny's phone number got erased
          from my favorites and I have to ask
          her what my daughter wants for her
          birthday.
          Jay takes the phone.

                         JAY
          Oh, I see the problem.
          He CHUCKS THE PHONE across the store, where it SMASHES TO
          PIECES. She leaves in a huff.

                         TREVOR
          I've always wanted to do that.
          okay, so here's what you do...
          Trevor pulls Jay in, ready to lay this top secret information
          on him...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Okay, so go to the clock app. And
          shake it.

                         JAY
          That's it?
          Jay does it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          On the phone -- TIME TRAVEL BETA

                         TREVOR
          Now you just type in the year you
          want to travel to...
          On the phone -- it's "augmented reality" -- the image through
          the phone is the image of the targeted time period.

                         JAY
          Okay, thanks.

                         TREVOR
          Now listen. This is highly
          crucial: Time travel is nothing to
          mess with. You can't change
          anything, you can't use new
          technology or all of space-time can
          just -- kablooey!

                         JAY

                         (OFF MISSILES)
          Yeah, well, is it ok if I change

          THAT?

                         TREVOR
          Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's cool.
          Jay is about to "enter" time travel...

                         TREVOR (CONT'D)
          Wait -- hold on a second. If you
          go -- I'm just gonna stay... and be
          dead?

                         JAY
          Don't worry, I'll fix it. You'll
          only be dead for a little while.
          Jay DISSOLVES INTO A TIME TRAVEL EFFECT...
          Cera is left alone. The missiles get EVER CLOSER...
          Trevor opens a "Voice Recorder" app:

                         TREVOR

                         (INTO PHONE)
          Trevor's last words. Dear
          posterity... Should anyone find
          this, let history remember that
          Trevor was a man of noble bearing,
          quiet dignity --

          (IMPACT!)

                         OH FUUUUUU-----

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          And the world is vapor.

          EVERYTHING GOES WHITE...

                         WHITE
          Pure white.
          Jay comes to, groggy, like he has the worst hangover of all
          time, brain bigger than his skull, trying to make his eyes
          focus.
          Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
          environment -- Is this the afterlife?
          The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
          The white resolves into

          INT. BATHROOM

          Jay realizes he's in a men's room, sitting in a urinal. The
          music transitions: Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
          was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
          song itself, played over a tinny portable radio.
          He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
          one of the stalls, washes his hands... and flips Jay a
          quarter.
          Jay stares at it a beat, confused. Misreading his confusion,
          the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter.

                         OFFICE WORKER
          What the heck, you're doing a great
          job.
          The kid leaves.
          Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in...

          INT. HIGH 60'S OFFICE

          White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye can
          see -- like the office in the Apartment.
          Jay stops in his tracks, taking in the 1969-ness of it all.
          An officious guy, annoyed, runs up--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         OFFICIOUS GUY
          You're late! Where's Mr. Watkins'
          lunch?

                         JAY

                         OH--

                         OFFICIOUS GUY
          Did his girl not put in the order?
          The officious guy glares at the "girl" -- in her 60s.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
          (shoves a bill in Jay's

                         HAND)
          Run down to Woolworth's -- Two
          hamburger sandwiches, fries, egg
          cream, and a pack of luckies. If
          you're back in half an hour, you
          can keep the change.
          Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL.

          OFFICIOUS GUY (CONT'D)
          On the double, OK?

                         JAY
          Yeah.
          Jay's moves to the elevator, waits for it. Pockets the
          profits of the racist misunderstandings.
          Elevator opens, the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
          climbs in with a car full of older executives.
          Jay shakes his head, just taking this all in.

                          JAY (CONT'D)
          Wow. 1969. You're all dead now.
          Just as the elevator's about to close, a leggy blonde tosses
          him a set of keys.

                         BLONDE
          The Big Man wants his caddy. Chop-
          chop.
          The doors close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          EXT. PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR

          Jay's got the keys. He looks at the parking tag, walks down
          a row of beautiful classic cars, looking for the right car --
          stops and smiles.

          THE BIG MAN'S CADDY - JAY DRIVING
          Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille
          convertible. Fins, chrome, a thing of beauty.
          From the seat next to him -- a fedora. He puts it on,
          completing the look.
          In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled at
          by the guy who must be "The Big Man" Jay HONKS and waves --
          thank you!
          Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
          minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York.
          A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS' "Can't Get Next to You"
          comes on the radio. Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

          SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST.
          At a light, he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
          couple. They give him a disapproving look. The woman
          clutches her pearls just a little more protectively.
          He smiles and leans towards them.

                         JAY
          Guess what? Black president!
          He laughs and drives off.
          Pulls up at...

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          The secret entrance to MiB HQ, familiar from the first movie.
          Jay strides up to the entrance and... can't open the door.
          Bangs on the door -- nothing. Shaking the knob, calling to
          the guard... nothing. From behind him:

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Help you? Look a little lost.

                         JAY
          Yeah, thanks, listen--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.
          Jay turns and is face-to-face with two grinning Staten Island
          cops. He instantly realizes what's about to go down.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         (SIGHS)
          Yeah, guess I knew this wasn't
          gonna be just people handing me
          money and Cadillacs.

                         COP 1
          'Scuse me?

                         JAY
          Nothing, officer. I'll be on my
          way.

                         COP 2
          That's an awful nice car.

                         JAY
          Thanks.

                         COP 1
          Kind of work you do, individual of
          your particular... ethnic
          persuasion... to buy a car like
          that?

                         COP 2
          Wouldn't be anything illegal, would
          it?

                         COP 1
          You an athlete or something?

                         JAY
          Yeah, I'm the North American
          champion of kiss my ass.
          The cop loses his smile, turns to his partner:

                         COP 1
          That sound like resisting arrest to
          you?

                         COP 2
          Sure did.
          They grab him, start to frisk him --

                         COP 2 (CONT'D)
          Well, well. Boy, you're gonna have
          a little problem explaining THIS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.
          The cop holds up Jay's HIGH-TECH GUN -- the NOISY CRICKET
          and his NEURALIZER.
          A BLACK CROWN VIC SCREECHES UP between the cops and JAY.
          Out steps KAY -- but 40+ years younger.

                         KAY
          (flashes a badge)
          I'll take it from here.

                         COP
          Who the hell are you?

                         KAY
          Agent Kay, Division 2, special...
          (gives Jay a look)
          .black ops. Thank you for your
          cooperation, if I could ask you to
          look here for a moment --
          Kay pulls out what looks like a NEURALIZER -- and swiftly
          beats each one over the head -- it's just a BLACKJACK -- they
          crumple.

                         JAY
          Kay? Kay, is that you? Oh, man
          it's good to see you, buddy!
          Jay hugs Kay -- who remains stony-faced. Jay gets a little
          choked up to see his friend alive -- Kay is a rock.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Look at you, all... sort-of-
          young... Kay!

                         KAY
          That's got to be the first time an
          unregistered alien caught sneaking
          onto Earth was happy to see me.
          Jay pulls away, realizing--

                         JAY
          Oh! You think -- aw,that's funny.
          No, it's not like that. You see,
          I'm your partner.

                         KAY
          If I had a partner I'd know it.

                         JAY
          There's a simple explanation for
          that.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         KAY
          I'm all ears.

                         JAY
          You see I'm your partner...
          (knows he's about to sound

                         CRAZY)
          In the future. And I came back to
          save you.
          A longdry stare.

                         KAY
          Well, thank you very much.

                         JAY -
          Hey, no problem, man. I got you--

                         KAY
          Yeah, thought I'd heard them all.
          Usually, they offer a great gift to
          the people of Earth in exchange for
          refuge. Time-travelling partner
          from the future -- that's some
          extra-credit right there, and I do
          appreciate you bringing some much-
          needed variety to what can be a
          very dull job. But I'm still gonna
          have to bring you in.

                         JAY
          Yeah, ok, I know it sounds a little-

                         KAY
          It sounds a LOT--

                         JAY
          That's why I'm going to prove it to
          you... Because if I weren't from
          the future, would I know about --
          your little top-secret headquarters
          right HERE??
          He tries to force the door open. Nothing.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I said -- HERE?
          (tries - nothing)

          HERE??!?
          Jay finally kicks the door open --
          And inside... we SEE...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          An abandoned building, filled with spiders, etc.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Right. Not here yet. But it will
          be. Gonna need to get rid of the
          raccoons and bats and stuff, but...
          it'll be real nice. Game room over
          there for your pinball, you love
          your pinball. Lotta good times
          there -- I'm going for an extra
          ball, Jay! you'd say. And I'd be
          there. With you. Partners.
          Long stare from Kay.

                         KAY
          Let's go. And word of advice -= I
          don't know what it's like on your
          planet, but around here, a guy with
          your... complexion in a car like
          that is gonna get some attention he
          doesn't want.

          EXT. NEW JERSEY STATE PARKWAY

          We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what
          sounds like ten Harleys at once.
          Reveal -- Yaz, the nightmare biker, looking like Dennis
          Hopper meets Satan, riding a badass custom skull-themed rig
          that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse.
          His skull ring gleams on his pinkie. Devil Girl sits behind
          him, hands on his shoulders.
          We ride with them a beat, tearing down the highway...
          They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted microbus
          full of hippies.
          One of the hippies leans out --

                         HIPPIE
          Hey, you guys like to party? Care
          to make a trade for the mama?
          Yaz pulls out his alien "guns." The stoned hippie smiles
          serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths. Makes a
          peace sign.

                         HIPPIE (CONT'D)
          Make love, not war.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.
          Yaz "fires" the alien -- it launches into the microbus --
          followed by its brother.
          The microbus rocks, hippies scream, the bus dents from the
          inside-out. On a bumper sticker: If This Van's a-rockin',
          don't come a knockin'.
          The guns, finished, return to Yaz.
          Yaz surveys the carnage, picks up a medallion off one of the
          hippies. But looking at it more closely, frowns and throws

          We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE.

          INT. HORN AND HARDART'S

          A great NYC automat...
          The kind of place you go when you like to be alone.
          Loners and weirdos populate the tables, minding their own
          business. Immigrants read foreign papers.
          Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines
          offering pies... pastries.., beverages...

                         JAY
          Is this your favorite place? Makes.
          sense. Zero human interaction.
          Kay ignores him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          So how old are you?

                         KAY
          Twenty-six.

                         JAY
          Really? Wow, you got some city
          miles on you.
          Jay laughs. Kay ignores him, stops in front of a machine
          offering "SPECIALS".
          Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table: We see headlines about
          Nixon, Vietnam, the Apollo Launch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          Jay looks at the date: July 14, 1969.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          The fourteenth. Then we have two
          days.
          Kay really takes his time, picking out the right sandwich.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey, look, I know your lunch is
          important, but like I said, we only
          have two days here.

                         KAY
          Here we go...
          Kay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his
          selection. Jay reacts to it -- GROSS!
          We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever. The meat
          is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy. No
          one in their right mind would buy this sandwich.

                         JAY
          No way, man. I am not letting you
          eat that. I didn't come all the
          way here to have you die before I
          can tell you--
          Kay reaches for the button. Jay slaps his hand away.
          A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          No way, man. No way the world ends
          because you had to eat that thing--
          Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and

                         FWOOOOOOPI
          A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay are

          INT. MIB 1969 HQ

          A cloud of smoke... It clears and reveals
          Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe. It's
          how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the MiB
          offices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.
          The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking. Aliens run
          around with ashtrays, cocktail shakers and cigarettes. The
          alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices.
          The !liB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege. Very
          male and very white. Women are there to be secretaries and
          eye candy.
          Two many-armed aliens stock the automat. Kay tosses one the
          sandwich, it goes right back into the automat.
          Jay recognizes the aliens -- it's the twins!

                         JAY
          Hey! [long alien name] and Bob!
           Don't worry, you guys get a big
          promotion in, like, 20 years.
          Kay takes Jay down an escalator. Quick atmospheric
          establishing shots of MiB '69:
          - A wall of Black and White TVs monitoring the aliens of the
          times: Castro... Yoko... Hendrix...
          - A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very
          high-tech camera. Reveal they're using it to watch a
          secretary's ass. She gets wise, turns -- they raise their
          martinis and she giggles at them: You're incorrigible!
          - Aliens work switchboards, work in the steno pool.
          - Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
          clean something up.
          - An MiB barbershop quartet practices.

          INT. HOLDING ROOM

          Typical interrogation room table in the middle.
          Kay pulls out a giant form -- it looks like 10 tax returns
          stacked together. He fits sheets of carbon between the
          pages.

                         JAY
          Oh, we're gonna do the forms now.
          Listen, Kay, I know you're gonna do
          what you're gonna do, but we're
          burning time here. When I got
          here, you had 48 hours. Now you've

          Kay looks at the form, there's a number of options to check:
          "Create a new race... Steal Earth women... Offer life of
          eternal youth... vacation... Save the Earth." He checks the

          There's a killer out there. Goes
          by "Yaz." He's coming for you.
          You told me your one regret was not
          killing him when you had the
          chance.

          Never heard of any Yaz.

                         JAY
          You will. Here's what to look for.
          Long hair, leather, looks kind of
          like a biker. You'll know him from
          the skull ring on his pinky. He's
          trying to blow up the Earth and you
          get in his way somehow so he kills
          you. This Friday. In Florida.
          So, if you want to live -- do not
          go to Florida.

                         KAY
          Florida? I hate Florida. I hate
          everything South of Virginia. If
          that's what you came to tell me,
          you're wasting your time.

                         JAY
          Man, you're as stubborn as you
          always were. I mean -- always will
          be. Look, It's not just about you.
          Because he kills you, you don't
          live long enough to build the
          defense shield. And without a
          defense shield, the Earth gets
          destroyed. You get it? He kills
          you, the Earth gets destroyed. I
          have to save you from him so we can
          save the planet.
          Kay stops writing.

          Kay looks up. Jay sees an opening:

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          You chose the job over her -- but
          you never stopped thinking about
          her. You can't forget her.
          Kay grabs him.

                         KAY
          How the hell do you know that?
          I've never told anyone that.
          A long look at this guy, who somehow knows things he
          shouldn't.
          And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON...
          But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAY'S
          TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic
          Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time,
          inches away from him.
          Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer, shaken.

                         JAY
          You see, Kay? It's me--
          But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--

                         KAY
          If you're gonna drag her into this,
          you'd better be able to back up
          your story. Because if you're
          jerking me around, I'll make a
          window out of your head.

                         JAY
          Yeah, okay, um -- according to the
          file, he should have entered Earth-
          space in the last couple days. Did
          you spot any unauthorized landings
          in the last 48 hours?
          Kay looks to a tech, who looks at a clipboard --

                         TECH
          We did have something -- a landing
          in New Jersey.
          Kay and Jay look at each other.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         KAY

                         (TO JAY)
          Alright, you're coming with me.
          Jay grabs his key chain.

                         JAY
          Can I ask how you're planning on
          getting me out of here?

          INT. MIB 1969 HQ

           Kay leads a "LOBOTOMIZED" Jay through HQ.

                          KAY
           'Scuse me, boys. Just did a code
           43 on this one.

                         JAY
          How's it going, fellas? Look, I
          put on my pants.
          He feels one of the agent's faces.
          Kay leads him to the exit. He talks to Jay as if Jay is a
          dim 3rd-grader who speaks little English:

                         KAY
          You are a tourist from Kansas. A
          city slicker took your wallet at
          the bus station...
          Kay leads Jay to a SET OF DOORS MARKED "EXIT to STREET" --

          MANNED BY MIB AGENTS.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Two out.
          The agents nod to Kay and WAVE HIM THROUGH-THE EXIT...
          Which deposits them in...

          INT. SHOWWORLD CENTER

          The peepshow megaplex from the bad old days of time square.
          A creepy pervert sits in a booth. Puts money into the
          machine.
          The wall SLIDES UP -- and to his surprise, instead of a
          peepshow...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.
          Jay and Kay climb out. Off the creep's reaction:

                         JAY
          Aww. Did I spoil the mood?

          INT. CROWN VIC - KAY DRIVING

          On the New Jersey State Parkway --

                         KAY
          You'd better not be wasting my time-

                         JAY
          Yeah, yeah. Window out of my head.
          But hey -- if I don't save you, I'm
          dead anyway. So do what you want
          to me -- just make sure you watch
          out for yourself.
          They pull up to...

          EXT. VINCENZI BROTHERS WASTE MANAGEMENT - OFFICES

          A squat shack on the edge of a dump, home office to a
          "legitimate local business."
          The windows are bloodied and broken from the inside.
          Corpses of wiseguys litter the front of the building, all
          showing disturbing spore growth. [please see
          http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuKjBIBBALS for reference]
          The corpses DEMATERIALIZE and disappear.

                         JAY
          This doesn't look like a mob hit.

                         KAY
          That's a hell of an observation.
          What gave it away?

                         JAY
          Spores. Dematerializing corpses.
          And THAT.
          Jay points beyond the building... a SHEER DROP
          Which is the edge of a HUGE SMOKING CRATER --
          And how did this crater get here?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.
          In the center, a GIANT ROCKET, all chrome and Flash Gordon.
          It formed the crater on landing.

                         KAY
          We're going in.
          Kay draws his weapon.

                         JAY
          Aren't you gonna give me a.gun?

                         KAY
          Right.
          He pulls out a Smith and Wesson, dumps the bullets, and hands
          it over.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Try not to get in my way.

                         JAY
          You try not to get in MY way.
          Jay and Kay move towards the building... BAM! BAM! BAM!!
          Someone's firing at them -- they dive for cover.
          More GUNSHOTS --
          Jay gives Kay THE SIGNAL, WE SAW IN THE CHINESE RESTAURANT

                         KAY
          What the hell is that?

                         JAY
          Stay behind me. You need to stay
          alive.

                         KAY
          The hell I will.
          Jay tries to go in -- Kay pushes him out of the way and goes
          in first.

                         VINCENZI BROTHERS
          Jay and Kay bust in -- almost fall into the room because
          they're squabbling over who's first --
          Then - BAM!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Someone's hiding under a desk, holding a gun over his head,
          firing randomly.
          Kay gets GRAZED --
          They dive for cover. Kay's right hand is bleeding.

                         JAY
          Huh. So that's how you got the
          scar.
          Jay tosses his EMPTY GUN into the corner -- the guy under the
          desk fires FIVE TIMES - EMPTYING HIS GUN!
          Jay sprints at him, flips the table -- it's a terrified,
          quivering WISEGUY. Jay grabs him and DISARMS HIM.
          The guy is FREAKED OUT.

                         WISEGUY

                         [TERRIFIED BLUBBERING]

                         JAY
          What'd he look like?

                         WISEGUY

                         [BLUBBERING]

                         JAY
          Pull it together!
          Jay SLAPS THE GUY.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          The guy who did this --- what'd he
          look like?

                         WISEGUY
          Looked like a biker... And he had
          a... He had a skull ring...
          Jay and Kay share a look.

                         JAY
          That's him.

          BACK WITH JAY AND KAY
          Walking up to Kay's car.
          In the background, MiB puts up a facade around the rocket --
          "Rocket Waste Disposal", techs take samples.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         JAY
          What about the witness? We don't
          have time to take him back to HQ to

                         NEURALIZE HIM--

                         KAY
          We've got something new. Portable
          Neuralizer.
          With a rumbling and BLASTS OF AIRHORNS, 18-wheelers drive up,
          housing the "portable" Neuralizer.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Can you believe how small these
          things are getting?

                         JAY
          Yeah.

                         KAY
          Okay, slick. I'm making a decision
          to believe you. Not because I do,
          but because I have to, you get me?
          He walks to the trunk, pops it open.
          He flips a switch, revealing a HIDDEN ARSENAL.
          He grabs a COOL GUN and gives it to Jay. Jay admires the

          DEADLY FIREARM.

                         JAY
          Aw, this means you like me, doesn't
          it?

                         KAY
          Let's go get this sunovabitch.
          They climb in but -- SCREECH!!!
          A Crown Vic swerves to a stop in front of them. Out pops an

          APOPLECTIC EX --

                         EX
          Kay! Don't move a goddamn muscle!
          I have you on 12 protocol
          violations!
          Kay looks to Jay.

                         KAY
          Make it thirteen.
          He GUNS IT -- THEY TEAR OFF...

                         YAZ'S BIKE
          Widen - he's on his bike, pulling into

          NEW YORK CITY - TOLLBOOTH ON THE BRIDGE
          Yaz approaches the tollbooth, manned by a gruff NY no-BS, no-
          time for anyone TOLLBOOTH COLLECTOR.

                         TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
          Exact change only.

                         YAZ
          Can you help a stranger, please?

                         TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
          Oh, sure. That's what I'm here
          for. You see that thing behind
          you? That's New Jersey. Go home
          and get some change.

                         YAZ
          There's been a great injustice in
          the Universe. I must make it
          right.

                         TOLLBOOTH COLLECTER
          You know what's also a great
          injustice? Sitting in this box all
          day listening to people try to get
          out of paying the toll.

                         YAZ
          Let me ease your pain.
          On Yaz's evil grin...

          KAY AND JAY DRIVE INTO THE CITY

                         KAY
          Now tell me everything you know
          about this Yaz scumbag.

          In two days he's gonna kill you in
          Florida.

                         KAY
          Two days. Doesn't give me a lot of
          time. You couldn't have come back
          a week ago?

                         JAY
          Sorry, I was distracted by the
          Earth blowing up.

                         KAY
          So we have two days to kill him
          before he kills me. Alright,
          there's one cesspool everyone
          washes up in sooner or later.
          Someone'll know something there.
          Come on. Let's take a drive to
          Alien Town.

                         JAY
          Alien Town?
          They drive under a sign indicating: EAST VILLAGE

                         WITH YAZ
          Cruising through NY. Devil Girl on the seat behind him. He
          pulls even with a patrol car.

                         YAZ
          Excuse me, officers of the law.
          Like you, I care a great deal. about
          justice and I'm looking for some
          people. Maybe you can help me.

                         OFFICER
          Okay -- get a shave and a haircut..
          They laugh.
          Yaz smiles sadly.

                         YAZ
          Have you ever lost someone close to
          you? I have. I've lost everyone.
          Everyone except them. Can you help
          me find them?
          He gives the cops a picture, they take it grudgingly -- we
          see it: a half dozen hippies wearing medallions.
          The cops look at each other and raise eyebrows.

                         OFFICER
          Only one part of town where people
          like that hang out...

          There's gotta be something that

          killed over some dry ice?
          Smuggling something in some dry
          ice?

                         KAY
          No. We just can't figure out what
          it is.

          Wow, you're pretty low on the totem
          pole, aren't you? The great Kay,
          looking for dry ice.

                         KAY

          A WAY-OUT 60'S PARTY
          Kay's on the hunt for someone. They weave their way through
          the far-out types, hear snippets of high-60s party
          conversations.
          Someone notices Jay's suit --

                         PARTY SNOB
          What are you, a time traveller?

                         JAY REACTS--

                         ULTRAVIOLET
          Yum, pigs are getting cute.
          Jay smiles -- she looks skeeved out.

                          ULTRAVIOLET (CONT'D)
          I meant the young one.
          Warhol speaks with his strange -- yes, almost alien --
          affect.

                         WARHOL
          It's not really a good time to
          talk. I'm creating a party.
          (sighs, totally put out)
          But... Maybe if he asks me.

                         JAY
          What - me?

                         WARHOL
          I would never say no to anything
          that came out of that beautiful
          mouth...
          Jay is visibly uncomfortable. Kay nudges Jay - do it.

                         JAY
          [Grumbles about what he has to do
          for his partner].
          (then, to Warhol)
          We need to talk. Please.
          Warhol and his Stars ooh and ahh over Jay. Someone snaps a
          picture.

                         WARHOL
          Amazing, just amazing. Alright,
          you talked me into it. Follow me.

          PRIVATE STUDIO LOFT
          From here, a window looks out over the whole scene.
          Warhol leads the guys in, shuts the door and LOCKS IT.
          Immediately, his ENTIRE AFFECT CHANGES -- he rips off his
          WIG, lights a cigarette, and talks like a hard-nosed cop.

                         WARHOL
          Damnit, Kay, are you TRYING to blow
          my cover?

          Take it easy agent W, your cover is
          perfectly safe.

          Perfectly safe? Are you out of
          your goddamned mind? It's only a
          matter of time before they figure
          out I'm a total fraud.

          Cool your jets--

                         WARHOL
          I'm so out of ideas I'm painting
          bananas and soup cans for
          chrissakes. How long do you really
          think they're gonna keep buying
          this shit?
          Warhol slumps on a chair.

                         WARHOL (CONT'D)
          I can't take it anymore. Talking
          to these nutjobs and all these
          goddamn hippies. God, I hate
          hippies. They're just filthy, Kay.

                         KAY
          Yeah, I know they are, buddy. But
          you're doing good work here. We
          need you.
          A knock at the door -- Warhol gets back into character --

          filming these men eating a
          hamburger... It's... transcendent.
          Okay, now the pickle...

          You see what I mean? And who the
          hell's this guy? New partner?

          Actually, I'm his old partner. I
          came from the future to warn him

                         WARHOL
          Jesus, fine, don't tell me.
          Alright, what do you need?

                         JAY
          We're looking for a recent arrival.
          Long hair, wears a lot of
          leather...
          Warhol indicates the party below -- half the guests match
          that description.

                         WARHOL
          You'll have to do better than that.
          Look, if that's all you have, I
          can't help you.

          Hold up -- the guy we're looking
          for -- he's out to destroy the
          world.

          destroy the world? Tuesday.

          one. Like we should take it
          serious. And we don't have much
          time.
          Jay checks his watch.

                         JAY
          33 hours.

                         WARHOL
          Yeah, yeah, alright.

                         (THINKS)
          Okay, talk to Prell and Vidal.
          C'mon.

          IN THE PARTY
          ON TWO BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - in very 60s fashion with incredibly
          giant hair - one with a big afro, one with big chignon
          hairdo.

          WARHOL (O.S.)
          (back in "character")
          Vidal, Prell, can you please talk
          to these nice men?
          The women's LIPS DON'T MOVE -- they respond in incongruously

                         GRUFF VOICES:

                         PRELL
          Whadaya want?

                         VIDAL
          They look like cops to me.
          ain't talking.

                         PRELL
          We're not rats.
          We swing around them to REVEAL that Warhol/Kay/Jay are not
          talking to the women's faces --
          They're STANDING BEHIND THE WOMEN -- TALKING TO THEIR HAIR-
          DO'S which we realize are two COMPLETE HAIR ALIENS, VIDAL and
          PRELL, perched atop these women.

                         KAY
          Start talking, you two, before you
          end up on a barber's floor.

                         PRELL
          Ah, you don't scare me.

                         KAY
          Yeah?
          Kay reaches into a passing woman's purse, pulls out
          HAIRSPRAY. Grab some of Prell and holds up the spray.

                         PRELL
          You wouldn't!
          He sprays the hair, it starts to SCREAM IN PAIN.

                         VIDAL
          Stop, you bastard!

                         PRELL
          I'm telling you, we don't know
          anything!

                         KAY
          You wanna play tough? How about we
          take a ride to the barber college,
          see how tough you are?
          Kay keeps shaking them down, but Jay is distracted...
          On Jay... something is making him think...
          A sound... it. grows louder... we start to be able to make out
          the distinct bip... bip... bip... of PONG
          Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND...
          To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from
          slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest
          freaks...
          They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever they're watching
          on TV is so mesmerizing it's like they're seeing the face of
          God...

                         BROOKE ASTOR
          It's too beautiful.
          Someone takes a picture of the screen.
          Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL:
          They're watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.
          The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to
          the TV antennae terminals. He's playing against a young
          clean-cut square.
          Jay grabs the wires and rips them out, cutting off the game.
          Everyone JEERS him.
          ON KAY, hearing the noise, turns to see what's going on.

                         SKANKY GUY
          What the hell, man?

                         JAY
          Just wondering where you got that.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Your mother.
          The crowd laughs.

                         JAY
          Really. So my mother gave you a
          technology that hasn't been

          INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS?
          Jay grabs him by the throat.
          Partygoers react. Someone takes pictures. Someone claps in
          delight.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Now how about you tell me where you
          really got it?
          The skanky guy knows he's in trouble.

                         SKANKY GUY
          Oh... uh... okay, no hassles,
          man... I got it from that dude over
          there... With the beard.
          Jay turns, lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT

                         THE WINDOW
          Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins
          And the CHASE IS ON

          CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE
          Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a
          commune, an ashram, a folk club, a protest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          Everywhere they are mistaken for "pigs" - people get in their
          way.
          To Jay's surprise, young Kay is a hell of a runner, in
          incredible shape. It gets competitive between them...
          Until Jay can't keep up -- Kay takes off...
          Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -
          Jay huffs and puffs his way over, grabs the medallion.

                         JAY
          Alright, one more time. Where'd
          you get this?

                         SKANKY GUY
          It was a gift--

                         JAY
          Bullshit.
          Kay puts a gun on him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Oh, hey. This is my partner. He's
          about to get fired for excessive
          violence and he doesn't have much
          left to lose.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I borrowed it!
          CLICK! Kay cocks the gun.

          SKANKY GUY (CONT'D
          I stole it, okay?

                         JAY
          That's what I like. A nice, honest
          thief. Stole it from who?

                         SKANKY GUY
          They don't even care, man. They
          leave their money everywhere.

                         JAY
          Who?

                         SKANKY GUY
          I don't know who they are--

                         KAY
          Then you're not worth much to us,
          are you?
          The gun comes back out.

                         SKANKY GUY
          I heard they were Archanans.

                         JAY
          Archanans? They're pretty far out
          of their neighborhood. I didn't
          think we'd ever had one on Earth
          before.

          Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue
          C. Top floor. Apartment 12.
          Jay rips the medallion off his neck.

          Ow!

                         JAY
          I'll do a lot worse. Get the hell
          out of here.
          The guy runs off.

          What's the deal with the necklace?

          DOWN THE RATTY HALLWAY
          Jay and Kay move carefully, ready for trouble.
          They get to the door -- Apartment 12.
          Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT!
          They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN, PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES
          And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING

                         JAY
          That's from Yaz's ring. He was
          here. Or is here.
          Jay SIGNALS KAY

                         KAY
          Why do you keep doing that?

          INT. STUDIO APARTMENT

          They move into the room on high alert...
          But it's empty.
          They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology
          (including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
          wires hanging out) and lots of money.. LOTS of money...
          Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF
          MONEY. They've been using it for scrap paper, for napkins.

                         JAY
          So Yaz was never after you... he
          was after the Archanans. You just
          got in the way.

                         KAY
          Which must make them damn
          important. But what does he want
          with them?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         JAY
          'No sign of struggle. They must've
          cleared out before he got here.
          Like they knew he was coming.

                         KAY
          And he's probably on their trail
          now. But where the hell did they
          go?
          They look around, puzzling over this place. Jay picks up a
          $100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money.

                         JAY
          Think this might tell us something?
          On the $100 bill:
           A strange series of words and numbers: 3 2... 5 1... 7 5..

                         KAY
          Looks like some kind of code.
          We'll take it to HQ, run it through
          the computer. Figure out where
          they went.

          BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY
          Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway --
          Yaz steps out of the shadows --

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Jay and Kay head back to HQ. Kay drives, Jay stares at the
          $100 bill, squinting at it, turning it over --

                         JAY
          How about bible verses?
          Coordinates? Airplane flights?
          Shoe sizes?

                         KAY
          So this is how you do it in the
          future, huh? You just keep
          guessing until you figure it out?

                         JAY

                         (EUREKA)
          Phone numbers!
          They stop at a light.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.
          Suddenly -- WHAM! WHAM! Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the
          trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is
          basically Jodi Foster's Taxi Driver hooker costume --
          hotpants, mary janes, halter top. There's something familiar
          about her face...

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          For God's sake! Help me, would
          you? There's some maniac after me -

                         JAY
          Slow down -- who's after you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          He was like nothing I ever saw --
          crazy eyes, and this freaky skull
          ring.
          Jay and Kay look at each other:

                         JAY
          Get in.

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          Thank you so much. This is a
          dangerous city for a girl.
          The light turns green -- we're on the girl's face. Jay and
          Kay looking straight ahead.

                         JAY
          So where can we take you?

          HOT PANTS GIRL
          Just make a left up here.
          Kay does it... There's a rushing noise...
          In the back seat, Hot Pants Girl IS "INFLATING" AND BECOMING

          DEVIL GIRL!
          The car turns down a dark, deserted alley.

                         JAY
          Are you sure? Seems dangerous.

                         DEVIL GIRL
          Not for me.
          Reveal -- the girl has fully "inflated" into her natural form
          -- DEVIL GIRL! The outfit is grotesque on her.

          DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          SET PIECE FIGHT in the car. Employing cool MiB tech built
          into the car.
          Devil Girl subdued, locked into the trunk in a "CONTAINMENT
          SACK" -- like what you'd use to stuff a raccoon into.
          The fight's over, the guys slump against the car.

                         JAY
          What the hell was that?

                         KAY
          I don't know, but I'd bet you two
          to one Yaz sent her.
          Beat. Light bulb moment for Jay --

                         JAY
          Say that again!

                         KAY
          I think Yaz sent her.

                         JAY
          No, the whole thing!

                         KAY
          I'd bet you two to one Yaz sent
          her.
          On Jay, realizing--
          He grabs the $100 bill --

                         JAY
          I know where they are!

          ON JAY AND KAY
          Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds, of cheering, REVEAL we

                         ARE AT--

          EXT. AQUEDUCT RACETRACK


                         JAY
          How are we going to find them? Any
          idea what an Archanan looks like?
          And then -- they see --

          AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS, HATS, AND SKINNY TIES...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.
          A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful,
          playful, dressed in robes.
          They could only be -- the Archanans.
          The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and
          three younger ATTENDANTS.

                         KAY
          I think I found them.
          They step into

          THE ARCHANANS' AURA
          Within the space around the Archanans, the chaos and noise of
          the crowd melts away. Deflected.
          There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --

          THE LAMA.
          In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings.
          All is peaceful within this space. Faint chimes.
          They greet Jay and Kay happily, chant a strange mantra:

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)
          King Lady Big Trouble Classy...
          The faint sound of an announcer:

          ANNOUNCER (V.0.)
          Results for the sixth race: King,
          Sweet Sophie, Big Trouble and Red
          Gent!

                         ARCHANANS

                         (CHANTING)
          Superba pays 3200 to one...

                         JAY
          You're in danger--

                         ARCHANANS
          You're in danger... you're in
          danger...
          Jay thinks they're playing the "echo game" like little kids:

                         JAY
          Very cute, but--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

                         LAMA
          In eight seconds, please do us the
          kindness of ducking.

                         JAY
          Huh?

                         KAY
          Yaz!
          They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES!
          Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses.

                         JAY
          Thanks.

                         KAY
          Let's get into trouble.
          Jay and Kay engage him --
          As they run off, the Lama calls --

                         LAMA
          Remember, please, to take the
          bridge.
          And we begin

          BIG FIGHT SET PIECE.
          Try to include motorcycle and horse elements. Could also
          involve the actual aqueduct, which is close by.
          At one point, Jay and Kay seem stuck, they remember...

                         JAY
          Take the bridge...
          They take the bridge, which gives them an advantage on Yaz.
          At one point, Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is
          knocked down. Looks DEAD! But he shakes it off reveal
          the PONG medallion blocked the shot.
          Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island, with Yaz
          compressed into .a six inch cube - hauled away in the back of
          a garbage truck.
          The guys give chase -- they want him captured, but no luck.
          The truck drives off...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         KAY
          He's gone.

                         JAY
          Only a matter of time before he
          comes back. And this time he might
          be really mad.

          AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK
          Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK...
          It's like a ghost town.
          No Archanans to be found...

                         JAY
          Damn, we lost them. They come all
          the way across the universe and
          just when we're about to figure out
          what all of this is about--
          Then, faintly... a CHEER

                         KAY
          Hold that thought.
          They follow it out to

                         THE TRACK
          Which is empty. No spectators, no horses. Just the
          Archanans...
          Who stand near the track watching... nothing.
          And yet --
          They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
          ever.
          Jay and Kay exchange a "what the hell?" Look and approach
          them.

                         JAY
          Everybody OK?

                         ARCHANANS
          Everybody is everybody.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         JAY
          Yeah... guess I can't argue with
          that. So listen up -- Yaz is down
          but he won't be for long, so we
          need to start coming up with some
          answers. First of all--
          The Archanans CHEER. Jay shakes it off.

                         JAY (CONT'D)

                         FIRST
          The Archanans CHEER AGAIN.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          What are you cheering about?!

                         ARCHANANS
          The races.
          Jay and Kay keep approaching... Puzzled -- the track is
          empty...

                         JAY
          What races?
          Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura... and now--
          The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS WATCHING

          AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Where are we?

          LAMA.
          We are tomorrow.
          Jay steps backwards, out of the aura -- back to empty ghost
          town.
          Steps back in -- tomorrow's rabid fans, cheering the race.
          From the Archanans' POV -- we see ALL VERSIONS/ALL AGES OF

          JAY AND KAY..
          The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE.

                         JAY
          You... can see the future.

                         LAMA
          It is what you call the future.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         ATTENDANT
          Ah, the future. An illusion of the
          time-bound, borne of the fallacy
          that one moment follows another.

                         LAMA
          Yaz suffers from this greatly. And
          so he must have revenge on your
          planet.

                         JAY
          Revenge?, For what?

                         LAMA
          He mourns the past because he can
          not see the dead are still as alive
          as they ever were. Just not now.

                         JAY
          Okay, someday you're gonna explain
          that to me, but right now you need
          to stop the riddles because there's
          about two minutes until Yaz crawls
          out of his hole and gets back to
          trying to kill you. So help me
          out. I need to know IN ENGLISH why
          Yaz is trying to kill you and what
          that has to do with saving the
          Earth.

                         ATTENDANT
          We know what he will know.

                         JAY
          You know what... he will know...
          (figuring it out)
          You know his plans.

                         (REALIZING)
          And you're going to stop him. He
          wants to kill you because you stop
          him.

                         LAMA

                         (CHEERFUL)
          Yes, if he does not kill us first.

                         KAY
          Don't you know if he's going to?

                         LAMA
          Sometimes he kills us, sometimes he
          does not. There are many futures.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         JAY
          Okay, which future is the one where
          you live and the Earth doesn't blow
          up?

                         LAMA
          The one where you take us home.
          Jay and Kay exchange a look --

                         KAY
          Alright, let's get these freaks
          home, and pronto.

                         LAMA
          You must let go of your. attachment
          to time, beginning with your
          concept of "pronto."
          And on that -- THUP THUP THUP --
          12 Blacked-out helicopters...

           EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)
          Illegal aliens -- you are
          surrounded... Do not attempt to
          flee...
          Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS:

                         JAY
          No! We need to get them home!
          But it's all drowned out in the wind and dust...
          MiB "squad cars" -- pull up and surround them.
          Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and
          trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere.
          MiB agents descend on ropes, round up the Archanans--

          EX (V.0.)

                         (MEGAPHONE)
          Agent Kay! Return to your vehicle!
          Rendezvous at headquarters in 20
          minutes! We will escort you by
          air!
          And from the noise and chaos of the choppers...
          To silence...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

          INT. MIB HQ - BENCH OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM

          Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall.
          Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a
          table.
          Ex paces, clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other
          agents.
          Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus.
          Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up.
          Ex notices Jay for the first time --

                         EX
          What's he doing here? Didn't we
          just bust you?

                         KAY
          That was someone else. All these
          mooners look alike, right?
          A beat -- and Ex buys it completely.

                         EX
          Yeah... So look. We've talked
          about it. And you are to be
          commended, Agent Kay. You did a
          fine job bringing these illegals
          in. Now it's our job to get them
          out of the city for containment.
          Somewhere where if someone decides
          to blow them off the map, the
          collateral damage will be
          insignificant. Toronto.

                         KAY
          But they're in danger. One of the
          most dangerous beings in the
          universe is out to kill them--
          (looks to Jay)
          And if that happens, we're all
          going with them, because they're
          our only hope of survival.

                         EX
          Christ, if we listened to every
          Mooner who showed up telling us how
          they were gonna save the world,
          that's all we'd do. Do you know
          why Earth is still standing?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         EX (CONT'D)
          Why we're not a smoldering chunk of
          nothing? Because we don't stick
          our nose into other people's
          business. Especially people in
          danger, because they have enemies,
          and those enemies destroy Earth.
          Now. Are you going to execute my
          order or not?

                         KAY

                         (COLD)
          I thought we were supposed to be
          the good guys.

                         EX
          Careful, Agent Kay. That sounds
          like insubordination.
          Kay walks up to Ex, looks him DEAD IN THE EYE

                         KAY
          It sounds like you need to cut some
          eyeholes in your stomach, because
          your head is so far up your ass,
          that's the only way you could
          possibly see.

                         EX
          That's it. You're off this case.
          Stick to dry ice. If I catch you
          near them -- or him -- again, I'll
          have your badge.
          (to a bunch of other

                         AGENTS)
          You four -- take the Archanans to
          transpo.
          One of the agents looks up--

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Me? I'm just an accountant---

                         EX
          Go!!!

                         (TO JAY)
          And you... You just get out of
          here!
          The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out.
          Kay leans in to them--

                         KAY
          Don't worry, we'll--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         LAMA
          Yes, we know.
          Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him.

                         KAY
          What?

                         JAY
          I knew Agent Kay wasn't just gonna
          lie down. So what's the plan?

                         KAY
          You heard the man. We've got dry
          ice to investigate.

          GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK
          It's the truck that "compacted" Yaz. We follow it to the

                         MIDDLE OF

          GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP
          Where the truck dumps its load... Including YAZ...
          Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE.
          On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into
          its natural shape.
          Around the piles of garbage, other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER

          OUT...

                         DUMP EXIT
          Workers stop what they're doing -- get out of the way of
          something, disturbed.
          We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back
          together, but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong
          place, the head at a weird angle.
          He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself...
          Pops out an eye, swaps an arm...
          He unfurls his tongue, smells the air --

                         YAZ
          Where did you go...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         SHOWWORLD CENTER
          A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent... but four
          agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his
          peep show window.
          One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him:

                         ATTENDANT

                         (CHEERFUL)
          You will die alone.

                         SLEAZY GUY
          Yeah, I know.
          The agents lead the Archanans through the world's greatest
          emporium of sleaze.

          EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off

                         PASSENGERS --
           We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS, MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS --
          Kids crying, pulling on Mom's dress...
          We see -- it's the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK.
          And the line isn't moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE

          PAPER-HATTED VENDOR.
          DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer:

                         KAY
          Just a few more questions about dry
          ice and I'll be out of your hair...
          A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --.he sees Jay waving him over,
          pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans
          into the Station!

                         VENDOR
          I told you ten times -- I got no
          idea what dry ice is!

                         KAY
          (not listening).
          Thanks, you've been very helpful.
          Jay and Kay peel off, follow the MiB agents, leaving the
          Vendor scratching his head. He turns back to the kids.
          Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION

          The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
          Greenwich, but the Archanans are easy to spot.
          Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant!
          They spot a glimpse of robe, run after them, turn a corner --
          And it's just some Hare Krishnas.

                         KAY
          Damn. Wrong freaks.
          But Jay spots the Archanans...

                         JAY
          Over there, Kay!
          As they run off --

                         HARE KRISHNA
          Perhaps you'd like to join us for a
          vegetarian meal?
          Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --
          The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
          warning WET PAINT!
          The agents look around, then slip pass the ropes and through
          a NARROW DOOR marked "WET PAINT" or "MEN WORKING"
          Jay and Kay follow...
          Through the skinny half-painted door...

          THROUGH THE.SKINNY DOOR
          An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet. A
          problem: it's going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito
          aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL.
          Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of 'scuse me --
          pardon me -- hey, don't grab that!
          But once they power past the crowds, Jay's jaw drops as we
          reveal...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

          SECRET TRAIN STATION
          A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central, a secret hub for
          sending aliens back and forth all over the country.
          It's basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-
          sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere
          in banks, offices, etc.
          A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads, board
          the tubes and FWOOP off...
          Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed
          aliens... a newsstand with strange papers... The Beatles in
          line for Liverpool with a blue meanie... Kareem Abdul-
          Jabbar...

                         KAY
          On your 2 o'clock.
          They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO

          CANADA.

          TUBE TO CANADA
          The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans.
          They're about to load them into the tubes --
          Jay and Kay approach:

                         KAY
          Hold up.

                         MIB
          You're off this case, Kay.

                         MIB 2
          Yeah, but I heard there's some dry
          ice in Queens. Magic show at a
          kid's birthday party. Better
          hustle, you can get there before.
          the cake.
          They all LAUGH at Kay.

                         KAY
          Change in plans.

                         MIB
          What? We didn't hear about any
          change in plans.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         KAY
          Yeah, Ex just gave us the new
          orders -- check this out --
          Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his
          jacket pocket...
          The MiBers lean in...
          And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE

          TUBE!
          The MiB agents stumble, surprised --
          The Archanans, not surprised, step deftly out of the way, the
          MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube...
          Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize... One last VERY
          YOUNG agent is still standing there, wide-eyed:

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Don't hurt me! I'm just the
          accountant!
          He reaches for his radio... Jay talks him down:

                         JAY
          I know you're a little freaked out
          and you want to call for backup,
          but listen: When you've done this
          job for a while, you realize
          there's one rule -- things aren't
          what they seem. These are innocent
          beings that need our protection.
          Are you gonna do the right thing or
          are you gonna be a company man and
          send them off to die in Toronto?
          The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Good, good. What's your name?

                         YOUNG AGENT
          Agent Zed, sir.

                         KAY
          You're gonna be okay, kid.
          Jay can't help laughing --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         JAY
          He's gonna be better than OK. I'm
          not gonna give you so much shit
          anymore.
          The radio CRACKLES --

          EX (V.0.)

                         (ON RADIO)
          Zed, what's your status?

                         ZED
          Detainees are on the tube to
          Toronto. No sign of Kay. Over.

          EX (V.0.)
          Copy that, good work, Zed.
          Zed crosses off...

                         JAY
          Be nice to him. Trust me.
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans regroup.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Okay, you all wanted to go home.
          Well here we are. So how do you
          want to get off this rock? You
          guys have the spaceport on Long
          Island yet?
          Kay just looks at him.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          That place is a dump anyway. Best
          Margaritas in the Universe, my ass.
          What about the one in Ohio?
          The Archanans smile.

                         ATTENDANT
          Here is the way home.
          The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
          hands it to one of his attendants.
          The attendant bows, and RITUALLY PASSES IT... it passes
          through all the attendants and then to JAY.
          Jay gives it a look.

                         JAY
          Here, huh? You're sure?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         LAMA
          The only future that ends with life
          begins there.

                         JAY
          I'll take that as a strong "yes."
          Okay, then. Follow me.
          Jay pockets the card and starts herding them across the
          terminal. Kay catches up --

                         KAY
          Where are we going?
          Jay looks at him a beat.

                         JAY
          Omaha. And I'm gonna buy you the
          biggest T-bone you ever saw when we
          get there. So -- you head over to
          the Omaha tube and I'm gonna help
          these guys over here for a second.
          But I'll meet you in a minute. By
          the Omaha tube.
          They stare at each other --

                         KAY
          Sounds good. See you there.
          Kay turns to head off -- then, lightening fast, spins and
          reaches into Jay's pocket, snatches out the card --

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Omaha, my ass.
          Kay looks at the card: GREETINGS FROM SUNNY FLORIDA -- a
          tourist post card with palm trees, oranges and beaches.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Let's go.

                         JAY
          No, no, no. No way. Florida, Kay.

                         KAY
          That's what it says.

                         JAY
          Don't you get it?

                         KAY
          Yeah, it's hot and muggy. The old
          people drive slow.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          We'll stay somewhere air-
          conditioned and only drive after
          three when they're at dinner.

                         JAY
          This is why you were there. In
          Florida. Because of them. You
          were helping them and that's why...
          that's why you get killed. Today,
          July 16. I saw the report myself.
          Agent Kay, dead at the scene.
          Killed by Yaz.

                         KAY
          You know what an MiB agent calls it
          when he faces death? Besides I got
          you to watch my back, right?
          They walk to the FLORIDA TUBE

                         JAY
          I just want you to know, I'm doing
          this out of love, man.

                         KAY
          Doing what?
          He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM.

                         JAY
          You stay home and stay alive.
          But Kay isn't down.

                         KAY
          I told them I'd help them -- I'm
          honor-bound to do it.
          Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jay's kidney.
          Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kay's solar plexus.
          Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard.

                         JAY
          Damn, you used to have some abs.
          They continue to pound each other. As they trade punches:

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          I can't let you go to Florida.

                         KAY
          I make my own future! Besides --
          I'm younger and stronger than you!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.
          They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time --
          feet collide.

                         JAY
          Bet you're sorry you taught me
          that.
          The fight continues... They're wearing down, circling each
          other...
          And then Kay fakes a left ---

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          You always lead with your--
          But this time Kay connects with his right, knocking Jay down
          hard.

                         KAY
          Had enough yet?
          On Jay -- gasping, spent -- using every last reserve of
          strength to lift himself off that floor.

                         JAY
          I can't let you go -- I love you!
          Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN. Kay LUNGES AT JAY.
          They CLINCH... it's a stalemate...

                         KAY
          Aw, hell, look at that-- behind you-

                         JAY
          I'm not falling for that.

                         KAY
          I'm not kidding --
          Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see...
          The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully, benignly hopping into the

          FLORIDA TUBE.
          Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE!

          THROUGH THE TUBES
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of
          pneumatic tubes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.
          The Archanans fly through the tubes, relaxed and happy,
          moving gracefully, like fish through water...
          Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
          clenched, hands by his sides, looking like he's in an "air
          luge"...
          Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
          like a pinball...
          They shoot SOUTH, passing landmarks of the Eastern
          seaboard...
          Intercut with Jay's face -- blown back like Right Stuff
          astronauts in a G-Force simulator.
          Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans, grabs onto the Lama's robe:

                         JAY
          (yelling over the wind

                         NOISE)
          I have to know -- can I really
          prevent Kay's murder?

                         LAMA
          Yes.

                         JAY
          Oh. Okay, then. Thanks, good to
          hear.

                         LAMA
          But where there was death, there
          will be death.

                         JAY
          What does that mean?
          The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current. Jay gets
          CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube.

          EXT. FIELD

          Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION

          PIPE.
          They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the
          hell was that?
          We follow the SCREAM...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

          BACK IN THE TUBE
          Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
          All passengers, prepare to de-tube.

                         JAY
          De-tube?

          TUBE P.A. (V.0.)
          Please make sure all helmet and
          crash suit straps are securely
          fastened.
          On Jay -- no helmet, no crash suit.

                         JAY
          Helmet? No one said anything about

                         A--

          POOP!

          EXT. FLORIDA SWAMP/MANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE

          Jay, Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like
          human cannonballs...
          The Archanans land gracefully, floating down air currents
          like kung fu masters...
          Kay hits with both feet and rolls...
          Jay face plants into the water.
          Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN. The ALPHA
          MANATEE emits along, lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO

                         COUGHING --

                         ALPHA MANATEE
          Sorry, I have something in my
          throat. They went that way...

                         JAY
          Thanks.
          Surrounded by thick brush, trees. Jay staggers out of the
          water, looking beat to hell.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Kay? Archanans? Everyone OK?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.
          Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed. Jay looks
          around -- nothing but brush and swamp.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Listen, your, uh...
          Arachaness...ness? I don't think
          this here is the way back to your
          planet.
          The Archanans smile and WALK OFF... Jay and Kay follow --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey wait -- we can't help you get
          home, if you don't tell us how...
          He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH
          And stop dead...

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Whoa. So that's how you're getting
          home.
          Reveal -- A GLORIOUS SHOT OF THE APOLLO ROCKET
          And they head towards destiny...

          CAPE CANAVERAL - LAUNCH SITE
          Jay and Kay take in the MASSIVE SCENE...
          The huge crowd, the security, the press. HISTORY IN THE

          MAKING.
          T-Minus 30 minutes.

                         JAY
          Okay. So we've got... 30 minutes
          to get past security. Get into
          Mission Control. Reprogram the
          flight path, pull the Astronauts
          off the launch and get them in that
          rocket.

                         KAY
          Well, then. Better get started.

                         JAY
          Weird. I feel like I've been here.

                         (BEAT)
          Okay, I've got a plan to get
          through security. We just need to
          be invisible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

          YAZ ON HIS BIKE
          Hurtling down the highway on his superfast bike, kicking up a

          HUGE DUSTSTORM...
          He gets STUCK BEHIND AN 18-WHEELER. Yaz REVS -- and SPEEDS

          RIGHT THROUGH THE TRUCK, SPLITTING IT IN HALF.
          Down the CAUSEWAY -- the rocket in the distance...

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          Heavily guarded by AIR FORCE SECURITY -- people with a lot of
          guns and very little sense of humor.
          And up steps Jay, leading Kay and the Archanans.

          JAY (O.S.)
          'Scuse me... I need to get
          inside... I've got the big man's
          Cadillac... all washed and ready to-
          Before the words are out of Jay's mouth, he's down on the
          ground with a submachine gun stuck in his neck.

                         GUARD
          Move and it's the last thing you
          do!
          The security is on Kay and the Archanans, forcing them down.
          Kay gives Jay a look --

                         KAY
          Good work. It's like we're not
          even here.

                         GUARD

                         (INTO RADIO)
          Sir, this is unit 3 bravo -- we
          have an attempted perimeter breach
          into mission control subhallway
          Charlie. One caucasian, one
          negroid, four... other. Yes, sir.
          We'll hold them here, sir.

                         JAY
          You've got it wrong, let me explain-

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         GUARD
          Shut up! Anything you have to say,
          you can say to my superior officer!
          And boy does he hate your kind...
          A click... click... click... Someone is approaching. Someone
          who walks like they mean business.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Lt. Colonel! Here are the
          intruders, sir!
          Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- he's African American. Jay
          grins, relieved --

                         JAY
          Finally, someone I can talk to--
          But the Colonel is on him before you can blink, an equal-
          opportunity hardass to the extreme:

                         COLONEL
          The only thing we're gonna talk
          about is what specific breed of
          dumbass you have to be to try to
          penetrate my launch site!
          He begins patting Jay down. Eyes widen --

                         COLONEL
          Weapon! You are going away for a
          long time...
          (to his men)
          Get them into holding. We'll
          interrogate them after the launch.
          A beat... and Jay goes for it:

                         JAY
          Sir, before you do that --- my name
          is Agent Jay. I appreciate your
          position, but I'm from a top-secret
          government agency in charge of
          protecting the world from the scum
          of the universe and right now, on
          behalf of the people of Earth, I.:
          need to commandeer your rocket so

                         THEY--
          (points to Archanans)
          --can board it. Can we count on
          your help?
          The Colonel stares at him for a beat..

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         COLONEL
          So you want us to stop the most
          massive endeavor in American
          history, an event being watched by
          the entire world, the moment that
          will be the culmination of a
          challenge put to us by President
          John F. Kennedy himself... so a
          bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a
          joy ride?

                         JAY
          Would it help if I told you I'm
          from the future?

                         COLONEL
          Get them out of here!
          He motions to the other MPs, who move to roust the group...
          But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          Hey!
          --and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA.
          On THE COLONEL'S face... He sees something POWERFUL
          The Lama releases him...
          The officer is stunned for a moment. Blinks back into focus
          and turns to the other guards --

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          You men are no longer needed here.
          Report to delta gate.

                         GUARD
          Sir?

                         COLONEL
          Go!

                         GUARD
          Yes, sir...
          The Colonel turns to Jay, Kay and the Archanans:

                         COLONEL
          The rest of you, come with me.
          The Colonel heads into the building. They follow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         JAY
          Things change when you can see the
          future, right?

                         COLONEL
          They sure do. This is definitely
          about some next-level shit.
          The PA crackles:

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus seven minutes to launch...

          MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY
          Mission control is an underground hub with hallway "spokes".
          Jay, Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the
          hallway towards the main Mission Control center.

                         MISSION CONTROL
          A hive of activity leading up to the launch.. Miles and
          miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down
          shirts. Thick glasses, slide rules, pocket protectors -- a
          sea of IBM men.
          Everyone smoking, RUSHING AROUND, LAST-MINUTE CHAOS...
          Hunkered over computer monitors... reel-to-reel data tapes
          spinning. Less computing power than an iPhone, but we put a
          man on the moon.

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus six minutes...

                         JAY
          Attention, everyone! We've got a
          change in plans!
          Everyone's consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --
          they ignore him -- he keeps trying --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Hey! Attention over here! I need
          to talk to the man who can re-
          program this rocket!
          Still nothing --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Can anyone hear me? Hey! You in
          the glasses!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.
          25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn.

           COLONEL (O.S.)
          Agent Jay! Over here!
          They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation.

                         COLONEL (CONT'D)
          This is your man.
          The guys approach the Engineer --

                         ENGINEER
          You see this card? The rocket's
          flight path is all on cards just
          like this one. Right here --
          He indicates a long metal rack, like a mail-sorting machine,
          that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a
          processor.
          An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the
          cards like a mini-whirlwind. The cards spiral everywhere
          like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- they're
          magically re-programmed! And fly back into the rack.
          The engineers are STUNNED. And then PANIC:

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          The trajectory has been altered!
          A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR:

          TRAJECTORY CHANGE.

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          Abort launch! Abort launch!

                         JAY
          Slow down there! Everyone be cool!

                         ENGINEER
          Coolness is an inappropriate
          response!
          The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked "ABORT"

                         ENGINEER (CONT'D)
          Aborting in 5...

                         JAY
          No! Stop! Do not abort!

                         ENGINEER

          4...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it
          down in the button!

                         - KAY
          This might help.
          Kay reaches into his jacket, takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

                         NEURALIZER

                         JAY
          What's that? You been holding out
          on me?

                         KAY
          Little something I've been working
          on. Glasses if you've got 'em.
          Jay and Kay put on their glasses...

                         ENGINEER

          2.
          Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment, it's the iconic
          look of the posters...

                         JAY
          Ha ha, just like old times...

                         KAY
          Oh, and you might want to get under
          a desk.

                         JAY
          Get under a--?

                         ENGINEER
          One!
          The engineers hand comes down... but before he can hit the

                         BUTTON --
          Kay hits the trigger --
          But instead of a FLASH --
          A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing
          everywhere, knocking out the engineers.
          The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING:
          Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting
          KO'd.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         JAY
          What the hell was that??

                         KAY
          It's a high-velocity non-lethal
          pellet-gun. The boys in the lab
          call it the "hiv-nol-pog."

                         JAY
          Catchy.
          The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets
          swerve around them.
          EX RUNS IN, flanked by security and/or MiB agents.

                         EX
          It's Kay! There he is! Take him
          down! Shoot him if you have to!
          EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN, crumples.
          The pellets settle... quiet...

          P.A. (V.0.)
          T-minus... Five minutes.
          The engineers start COMING TO, dazed, wondering WHAT THE HELL
          JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a "neuralizer" cover

                         STORY:

                         JAY

                         (TO CROWD)
          What the hell is wrong with you
          people? Raquel Welch comes by for
          a personal tour of Mission Control
          and you faint like a bunch of
          schoolgirls!

                         KAY
          What a waste.

                         ENGINEER
          Raquel Welch was here?

                         JAY
          Five minutes to get to the rocket.
          And keep your eyes open for Yaz.
          They head out.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

          ON THE TARMAC
          With only a few minutes to go, service trucks CLEAR THE
          TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks, etc., Driving to get a safe
          distance away from the blast.
          The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY
          As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY, parting
          the waters -- it's a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the
          wheel, Jay, Kay and the rest, barely hanging on.

          ASTRONAUT TRANSPORT -- DRIVING
          The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the
          rocket. The only car. Looking up at that rocket.

                         NEIL ARMSTRONG

                         (GRANDIOSE)
          That's one little step that I did,
          one big step for the rest of you...
          Wait, that's not it. Did that
          sound weird to you guys?
          The driver SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

                         BUZZ ALDRIN
          What in Sam Hill is going on?
          Reveal the Jeep, pulled in front of the Astronauts, cutting
          them off.

                         KAY
          No disrespect meant, [major]. I'm
          a big fan. (Especially of the
          haircut.)

                         JAY
          But we've got some bigger fish to
          fry. Hand over the flight suits.
          They start pulling the astronauts off the truck.
          The astronauts protest.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Let's go, people. Why don't you
          take one giant leap out of there.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          They look at Jay and Kay... at the Colonel...

                         COLONEL
          That's right, gentlemen. You need
          to listen to them. We're going to
          protocol twelve.
          The astronauts acquiesce.

                         BUZZ ALDRIN
          I didn't want to get in that death
          trap anyways.

          EXT. MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

          The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty.
          They hear something -- they draw weapons --
          And it's Yaz. Still looking like evil incarnate. The guards
          take in this unholy picture...

                         GUARD

                         WHAT THE--

                         YAZ
          I want in.
          The guards look at each other --

                         GUARD
          Should we radio the Colonel?

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          You wanna get yelled at again?
          They wave him by.

                         GUARD (CONT'D)
          Go ahead.

          Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule., Technicians in

          Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all
          possible threats.
          Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go...
          Kay works'with the Archanans--

                         JAY
          We good yet, Kay? I don't like
          being out here in the open -- too
          many ways for Yaz to get to you...

                         KAY
          I'm almost there.
          Kay's got them inside, but having problems with the hatch.

                         KAY (CONT'D)
          Hey, tech guys -- get back here and
          help me with the door.

                         TECH
          It's called-a hatch.

                         KAY
          Whatever, just get over here.

                         JAY
          Oh, come on -- what's going on?

                         KAY
          This door is complicated.

                         JAY
          Oh, for...

                         KAY
          What? It's an Apollo rocket, not a
          Plymouth Valiant, OK? It's
          complicated.
          Jay goes over to help Kay with the door.
          They both fuss and fight over the door.

                         JAY
          Lift it. You have to lift it.

                         KAY
          No, I am lifting it. You have to
          hold the lever.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         JAY
          No, if I hold the lever, the rubber
          thingie won't... go in the thing
          where the thingie goes...
          Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass.

                         KAY
          Jay... Why do you think a highly
          trained NASA technician would leave
          the back of his suit unzipped?
          They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the
          Chinese restaurant...

                         JAY
          Because it's about to go down.
          They turn around, draw weapons on the tech -- it's YAZ!

          NOTE TO READER:
          Welcome to the good stuff
          From here, we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take us
          up and around the Apollo Rocket...
          As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-
          stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans...
           We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS, bentonDESTROYINGTHE
          EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand
          bubonic plague.
          The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes
          breathing fire, the gigantic scaffolding, liquid oxygen
          spewing from the rocket... All on top of a rocket taller than
          a 30-story skyscraper.
          With T-minus 25 seconds to go, Jay and Kay corner Yaz against
          the lunar capsule.

          BACK TO SCENE:
          Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay.

                         YAZ
          You can't stop me! Nothing on
          Earth can stop me!

                         JAY
          Nothing now.
          Yaz raises an eyebrow...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.
          Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
          future.

                         KAY
          What's that?

                         JAY
          Little something I brought with me.
          Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
          As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5... 4...

                         YAZ
          Try it! You wouldn't dare! One
          false shot and you'll rip space and
          time!

                         JAY
          That's a chance I'll have to take.
          Jay BLASTS YAZ
          Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE... The hatch SLAMS him in!
          Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--

          HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY AND

                         KAY -

                         KAY
          Uh oh --
          But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the
          flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them...
          And then it's over...

          BIG VICTORY MOMENT
          As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off...

                         JAY
          We did it, partner. I hope you
          remember this when you recruit me --
          you won't give me such a hard time.

                         KAY
          You know I will.

                         JAY
          Yeah.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         KAY
          I guess we'll have to build a
          prison on the moon or something.
          Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --

                         JAY
          Do a better job this time, OK?
          That needs to be one hell of a
          prison. You don't want that guy
          coming back, or I'm coming back.
          Look, once was enough, OK?
          Jay turns to The Colonel --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Thank you for your help, sir. Hope
          we don't get you fired.

                         COLONEL
          Not too worried about that.

                         JAY
          Can I ask you -- what did the Lama
          show you in there that made you
          help us? Was it the Earth being
          destroyed?

                         COLONEL
          No -- it was my son. All grown up.
          As a matter of fact, I'm late to
          see him -- I promised I'd watch the
          launch with him.

                         JAY
          Oh. Thanks. He's a lucky kid.

                         COLONEL
          I'm a lucky dad. Take care.
          Jay offers him a handshake. The officer takes it -- and
          pulls Jay into a hug.

                         JAY
          Okay...
          The Colonel leaves. Jay and Kay congratulate each other,
          smile over a job well done...
          But then they see the Archanans... And realize...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         KAY
          We're sorry we didn't get you home,
          guys. It was the only way to get
          rid of Yaz.

                         JAY
          But we'll make sure you're safe
          here. And the next rocket out...

                         LAMA
          All is well. You have done well.

                         JAY
          No we didn't. You wanted to go
          home...

                         LAMA
          There is what we desire and what
          must be... And now our gift to
          you...

                         JAY
          Gift? But we didn't get you home.

                         ARCHANANS
          There is the action and there is
          the intention. It is the intention
          we reward.

                         LAMA
          You did the right thing. And if
          humans are capable of such
          sacrifice, such friendship...
          perhaps we ARE already home.

                         JAY
          So then what's the gift?

                         LAMA
          You already have it.
          Jay looks at pong.

                         JAY
          This? Pong?

                         LAMA
          Yes. PONG. The Pan-Galactic
          Ordnance Negation Grid. Agent Kay
          will use this technology...

                         JAY
          To make the missile defense system.
          You use this to save the world.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         ARCHANANS
          Yes. Don't drop it.
          They take the PONG and drape it around Kay's neck
          The Archanans leave, chanting...

                         ARCHANANS (CONT'D)

                         (CHANTING)
          Bip... Bip... Bip...
          And it's just Jay and Kay.
          Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG... just like in the case
          file picture...

                         JAY
          Hey. My watch stopped.
          We see -- a minute to go. Jay looks at the watch. Something
          about it bothers him...

                         KAY
          C'mon. Let's go watch that bastard
          leave the atmosphere.

                         JAY
          Yeah, I'll catch up with you in a
          second.

          KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
          Jay hangs back, approaches the Archanans, walks them down the
          scaffolding.

                         JAY
          So you guys understand all this
          time stuff, right? So is
          everything going to be okay now? I
          mean, if I saved everything, and
          Yaz is really gone, why am I even
          here? Shouldn't I not have come in
          the first place? And why do I
          still have time left on my watch?

                         UNDERGROUND
          The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
          underground hallways.
          Jay walks, looking at his watch, thinking...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.
          ,He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 3:59.

                         JAY
          3:59. But Kay didn't get killed
          until...
          And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He didn't come yet! Kay, he didn't
          come yet!!!
          Jay races to find Kay.

                         WITH KAY
          Unaware that his appointment with death is near...

          WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
          Racing down a hallway... hunting Kay...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... running... searching... where is Kay?

          INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY... YAZ... JAY...
          All converging on destiny...

                         WITH JAY
          Running... more frantic now...
          And then he sees him!
          Kay -- at the end of the hallway!. Backlit by the door to
          the outside...

                         JAY
          Kay!
          And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there!
          Jay goes for his weapon, but he doesn't have the shot!
          Yaz pulls his guns...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.
          Kay turns to see Yaz -- there's no time to react, only to
          know HE'S ABOUT TO DIE!
          Yaz FIRES!!
          But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead! He catches the
          bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes.
          And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ AND
          KILL HIM, blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
          LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch.
          They look at each other -- it's over.

                         KAY
          See? I knew you had my back.
          Jay hears footsteps. Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

          MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAY'S OWN SILHOUETTE.
          As the footsteps approach, the shadow grows smaller,
          shrinking to KID SIZE. It's a boy.

                         KID'S VOICE
          Dad? What's going on?
          The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the shape
          of his head and Jay's reaction, this kid could only be YOUNG

          JAY.

                         JAY
          Where there is death, there will
          always be death. He saved your
          life. He swapped his for yours.
          He saved the world.
          Kay puts a firm hand on Jay --

                         KAY
          I'll take it from here.
          Kay steps away... but turns back.
          In a replay of the moment from the first movie, Jay tosses
          Kay a modern Neuralizer.

                         JAY
          Leave me some memories this time,

          OK?

                         KAY
          Sure, partner. I'll see you
          around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         JAY
          Yes you will.
          Kay turns back to the boy, takes his hand.
          Jay watches them from a distance:
          Kay takes something off the ground where The Colonel's body
          was -- hands it to the son.

                         KAY
          Hey, look -- your Dad wanted you to
          have this.
          Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key chain.
          Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain, scratched and
          worn.

                         YOUNG JAY
          Where is he?

                         KAY
          Your daddy had to go -- he's part
          of the space program, now. He's
          okay, he just had to take a trip up
          to the stars, but you'll be just
          fine. I'll keep an eye on you...
          They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
          launch...
          Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE...

          PURE WHITE LIGHT...
          And it resolves into...

          NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY...
          Jay comes to in the Apple Store, looks to the sky and

          THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING!!!

                         JAY
          Noo!!!!
          And then...
          A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

          PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

          EXT. MIB HQ ENTRANCE/VENTILATION BUILDING

          Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan security
          guard.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man.
          He gives him a hug-- gets a "what the hell?" face.

          INT. MIB HQ

          Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can.
          No one else knows what he's talking about -- from their POV
          he never left... It all seems the same except for quick shots
          of Ex the bitter janitor, aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee
          cart...
          Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- it's just a regular day to
          everyone else, but it's HOME SWEET HOME to Jay.
          He even gives the worm guys a big, gushy hug.
          A crowd of people gathers around Kay, congratulating him on
          winning the Bowling trophy... AGAIN.
          Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay.

                         KAY
          Alright, everyone, give me and my
          partner here a minute.
          They leave the guys alone. A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
          in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER.

                         JAY
          It's good to see you, man. So
          good. I just... do you remember...
          I mean, do you know what I've been
          through?
          Kay just stares at him.

                         KAY
          You mean, do I remember that you
          travelled back in time to save my
          life and the world? Not bad,
          slick. Not bad.

                         JAY
          No problem. You'd do the same for
          me. I just have one question...

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          When you disappeared... Why didn't
          I forget you when everyone else
          did?

                         KAY
          Well, I don't know exactly.
          Because I was dead. But in a
          quantum reality, objects can exist
          in contradictory states... So
          multiple timelines with varying
          probabilities can exist, and the
          one you're closest to

                         MATHEMATICALLY--

                         JAY
          Oh, you're talking about our
          closeness... you're talking about
          our love... Across timelines!
          You're saying our love will go on!
          Kay swats him away -- but the love couldn't be more clear.
          Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain. Takes it
          out.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          He was a good man.

                         KAY
          Yes he was.

                         JAY
          I'm glad I know that.

                         KAY
          So you travelled back in time, huh?

                         JAY
          Yep.

                         KAY
          Wow. And you didn't change
          anything?

                         JAY
          No.

                         KAY
          You're sure? Because the littlest
          thing can have huge repercussions.

                         JAY
          I was very careful.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         KAY
          Good man, good man. Well, let's
          get you a uniform.

                         JAY
          Excuse me?
          We PULL BACK --
          Revealing PRESENT DAY MIB IN ALL ITS KICKASS GRANDEUR.
          Eternally vigilant in the struggle to protect the Earth and
          all its inhabitants...
          And every one of those agents wearing BLUE SUITS WITH SHORTS.

                         JAY (CONT'D)
          Even I can't make that look good.

          FADE TO BLACK.
THE MEN WHO STARE AT GOATS

          2   ...CLOSE ON A MAN'S FACE...                                      2
              He is STARING at us with fixed concentration. He is
              sweating slightly in the summer heat. We hold for a
              moment. Silence, apart from the soft swish of an unseen
              ceiling fan.
              WIDE SHOT - the Man, wearing military uniform, sits at
              his desk in his office, still staring straight ahead.
              SUPERED TITLES appear, reading: General Putkin, United
              States Army Intelligence SED. Arlington, Virginia. 1983.
              The General's assistant, LIEUTENANT BOONE, sits at his
              desk, working. After a moment Putkin seems to come to a
              decision.

                                      GENERAL PUTKIN

                             (SOLEMNLY)
                        Boone?

                                        LIEUTENANT BOONE
                        Yes General?

                                      GENERAL PUTKIN
                        I'm going into the next office.

          

                                        LIEUTENANT BOONE
                        Yes sir.

          
              The General stands up, smooths down his uniform, steps
              out from behind his desk and begins to walk. Boone
              watches, with some trepidation, as the General increases
              his pace. He quickens to a jog, his face set with
              determination.

          
              He breaks into a run...

          
              Then he slams into the WALL of the office, rebounds and
              lies splayed on the floor.
              He stares up at the wall balefully.

                        Damn it!

          

                                                                        2.

              General Putkin is being driven in a jeep through the vast
              military base. He has a band-aid over his injured nose.
              SUPERED TITLES read: Special Forces Command Centre, Fort
              Bragg, North Carolina.

          

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (O.S.)
                         I have been having ideas,
                         gentlemen. Challenging ideas. And
                         when I thought about these ideas I
                         thought about who in the U.S Army
                         would be most receptive to my
                         challenging ideas.

          
              The Jeep pulls up at the SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE.
              The General gets out, a brief case in his hand and
              surveys the centre.

          

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D) (O.S.)

                                       (CONT'D)
                         Which section of the military is
                         always straining to reach the peak
                         of their physical and mental
                         capabilities?

          

          4   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                       4

              General Putkin stands in front of a room full of seated

              SPECIAL FORCES OFFICERS.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN
                         You are, gentlemen. Special
                         Forces.
              The assembled Officers nod modestly.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                         I want to talk to you about Mind
                         Wars, gentlemen. War...With...

                         MINDS...
              His audience stare at him. With a flourish he produces a
              BENT FORK from his briefcase.

                                       GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                         How'd you like to be able to do
                         this? What if you could teach
                         soldiers to do this? Would you be
                         interested?
              Silence.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                                (changing tack)
                           Or, or let's say you have a unit
                           operating outside the protection
                           of mainline units. What happens if
                           someone gets hurt? How do you deal
                           with that?
              He surveys the blank faces.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                           Psychic healing! Protect the unit
                           with hands-off healing. Using the
                           mind to heal.
              Silence. Putkin senses he is not convincing his audience.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                           Let's talk about time! What if
                           time is not a point but a space
                           and at any one instant we can be
                           anywhere in that space! (Laughing)
                           Physicists go nuts when I say
                           that!
              Silence. He is growing desperate.

                                         GENERAL PUTKIN (CONT'D)
                           Animals! Stopping the hearts of
                           animals! This is the idea I'm
                           coming to you with. You have
                           access to animals right?
              Special Forces look like they've had enough. A tough
              looking officer - MAJOR JIM HOLTZ - stirs.

                                         MAJOR HOLTZ
                           No sir. We don't have access to
                           animals.

          

          5   EXT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   5

              A dejected General Putkin climbs back into his jeep.
              Lieutenant Boone, in the driving seat, looks at him with
              sympathy.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           In 1983, when Special Forces told
                           General Putkin that they weren't
                           interested in his ideas...that was
                           a lie.

          

          6   INT. SPECIAL FORCES COMMAND CENTRE - DAY                   6

              The BENT FORK sits on the table in the EXTREME
              FOREGROUND, a window in the background.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           And when they told him they didn't
                           have access to animals...that was
                           also a lie.
              We FOCUS on the window - a shaky ZOOM taking us towards
              an abandoned looking HOSPITAL BUILDING half hidden by
              trees.

          

          7   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY                               7

              We TRACK forward into the shadowy interior into a large
              space which we now see is full of...GOATS.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           The hundred goats in the disused
                           hospital building had been
                           secretly flown in from Central
                           America so as to avoid customs.
                           Special Forces weren't worried
                           about the General hearing the
                           goats because they'd been de-
                           bleated.
              The GOATS stare at us, their mouths silently opening and
              closing.

                                         BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           This is the story of those goats.
              We CLOSE ON the unblinking EYES of one GOAT, then...

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

          

          8   INT. LOCAL NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY                           8

              Bob sits typing at his desk in the modest office. He
              wears glasses, is attractive in a fresh-faced,
              enthusiastic kind of way. SUPERED TITLES read: Ann Arbor,
              Michigan, January 2003.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           My name is Bob Wilton. Imagine me
                           back in Michigan, where I was born
                           and raised. I studied journalism
                           at Western in Kalamazoo and then I
                           got a job at the Ann Arbor Daily
                           Telegram. I wrote a lot of stories
                           about competitive food eating
                           contests.
              He looks at the photograph of his wife Debora on his desk
              and up to where she stands, photocopying in DAVE the
              Editor's office. Dave is chatting to her. He has a
              PROSTHETIC ARM. Bob watches his wife, smiling.

                                (SADLY)
                           Look at me. So young. "The past is
                           a different country. They...do
                           things there."
              We PAN to the next desk and Bob's over-weight colleague
              RON, who sits eating a hot-dog.

                                          BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           This is Ron.
              Ron suddenly pitches violently forward, thudding face-
              first into his desk.

                                         BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           He's the man who died.

          

          9   INT. OFFICE - LATER                                          9

              Bob is clearing Ron's desk, putting his possessions into
              a box.

                                         BOB (V.O.)
                           My wife, Debora, told me later
                           that Ron's death had been like a
                           wake-up call for her - what people
                           used to call a memento mori.
              Bob sits down, feeling a little ghoulish, at the dead
              man's desk. He notices a large INDENTATION on the leather
              in front of him - the mark left by Ron's forehead. He
              touches it, fascinated.

                                         BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                           That massive coronary had reminded
                           her that life was too short to
                           waste any chance of true
                           happiness.
              Bob rests his own forehead, experimentally, onto the
              indentation, and sits there, face down on the desk. His
              eyes wander over to where Dave and Debora are talking in
              Dave's office.
              BOB'S P.O.V - Debora's hand BRUSHES against Dave's,
              LINGERS just a fraction too long.
              Bob frowns.

               Bob and Debora and Dave talking. Bob is drinking. We JUMP
               CUT to Bob crying, smashing a lamp, Debora shouting at
               him.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                              (A sad chuckle)
                         It seemed like such a tragedy at
                         the time. We couldn't see beyond
                         our little lives to the great
                         events of history unfolding out
                         there in the world.
               JUMP CUT to Dave holding Bob in a head-lock with his one
               good arm. Debora is sitting, head in hands.

                         safe in the Shire.
               JUMP CUT to Bob alone in the trashed room, exhausted and
               drunk, watching Bush's STATE OF THE UNION SPEECH on TV.

                         already taking the first steps on
                         the path that will lead him
                         inexorably towards the heart of a
                         conflict between the forces of
                         Good and Evil.

                         Yeah, no it's been...well, I won't
                         lie to you Debora - it's been

                            things that you shouldn't, you
                            know...

               Bob stares out of the window, nodding, afraid he might
               start to cry.

                            Okay. Gotta go. We're moving out -

               Bob walks out and puts his sunglasses on, staring around
               the quiet POOL-SIDE area. He sighs, sits down on a a
               sunlounger, starts to read his book. TITLES READ "Kuwait

               Bob is drinking coffee with two gung-ho type war
               correspondents.

                                         BOB
                         Yeah.

                              (EMBARRASSED)
                         I've been stuck here. They've only
                         just given me the green-light. So
                         I'll probably head over there
                         soon. I'm just working on this
                         story about American contractors
                         coming over for the re-build.
               The Journalists look bored.

                                       BOB (CONT'D)
                         Yeah, I think they didn't want me
                         going over because I'm not
                         embedded.

                                       SECOND JOURNALIST
                         Yeah, they don't like the unilats.
                         The troops think the unilats'll
                         stab `em in the back. When you're

                         you form a bond with the soldiers.

               The man considers this. He looks up and we see his face
               for the first time - handsome, older than Bob, tanned, a
               moustache, a slightly haunted expression. This is LYN

               Lyn shoves the packet across the table. Bob sits down
               across from him, pats himself down for a lighter, glances
               over to where the two embedded Journalists are joking
               with some Marines. Bob watches them jealously.

                            I sat there watching those

                            be them. I wanted to face peril

                            rise of nations.

               pinned to his shirt. The name on the badge reads LYN S.

                         This is the home learning course

               table. Gus has a sun-bed tan and odd hair. His nervous
               looking MOTHER sits beside them. Gus is holding up a
               VIDEO CASE for Bob to see - the cover, illustrated with a
               picture of Gus, reads "Free To Roam - Learn E.S.P from

                            It started when I was a kid. I
                            used to lie on my bed and RV my
                            cousin, Irene, undressing at
                            night. Then, when I was in the
                            army I joined Bill Django's unit.
                            He trained me and the rest, as
                            they say...

                            We were Psychic Spies mainly. That
                            was our initial tasking but...once
                            they realized what they were

                         its wheel. Usually that hamster
                         loves its wheel.

               Bob hurries to catch up with Lyn. He follows him around a
               corner and skids to a halt. Lyn is facing him, standing
               on one leg, hands raised above his head in an odd martial
               arts stance. He emits a threatening croon. Bob raises his
               hands nervously.

                         He'd been appearing on this radio
                         talk show.
               Lyn relaxes his martial arts stance, shakes his head
               ruefully.

                         don't know what to make of this. I
                         don't know what to say. This is
                         amazing stuff. (Beat) How would
                         you...I wanna...could I write a
                         story about this?
               Lyn stops panting, takes a swig of whiskey, stares at the
               bottle, suddenly taciturn.

                         a story Lyn. I was going to

                         I was an American. I was Resolute.
                         I wanted adversity to reveal my

                         wife. And to that one-armed cunt
                         Dave.
               Lyn is staring at Bob's notebook. He takes it from Bob
               and examines Bob's DRAWINGS OF EYES.

               Lyn examines Bob - something DIFFERENT IN HIS ATTITUDE.

               He considers for a moment, struggling with himself, then
               seems to reluctantly come to a decision. He reaches into
               the bag on his bed and pulls out a dog-eared BOOK. He
               hands it to Bob.
               Bob examines the book - on the cover is a picture of Da
               Vinci's Vitruvian Man and the title Pentagon Report
               92245. The New Earth Army Manual.
               Bob stares at the book. He opens the first page and
               reads...

               Bill hits the ground, which is luckily mainly composed of
               MUD. He lies stunned as MORE HELICOPTERS lower around him
               and his PLATOON begin to debark. The Helicopters barely
               touch the ground before they take off again. SUPERED

               Bill gets up onto his knees and examines his M-16 - the
               barrel clogged with earth. He pokes his finger into the
               muzzle trying to clean it, then finds he can't get it
               back out again.

               Ahead of Bill and his Platoon is a WALL OF DEAD AMERICAN
               TROOPS - rotting in the sun.
               His men stand staring at the wall aghast. A PRIVATE
               beside Bill snaps and opens FIRE, yelling wildly.

               Bill grabs him with his free hand and shakes him, his M-
               16 hanging painfully from his other hand.

                            think...?
               THUNK. A SOLDIER standing next to Bill drops, the back of
               his head sprayed over nearby soldiers.

               SILENCE.
               Everyone stares at the dead man. Another shot rings out -
               another SOLDIER DROPS. The others flinch, scan the tree-
               line ahead of them.

               The WOMAN is jogging across the tree-line ahead, weapon
               in hand.

                            TAKE HER OUT!
               The Soldiers open fire - a deafening roar. The Woman
               keeps on running as the foliage above her head is
               shredded by bullets. NO SHOT COMES CLOSE. Bill watches
               amazed.

                            fired high. They instinctively
                            hadn't wanted to shoot another
                            person. Later Bill would come
                            across a study by General S.L.A
                            Marshall, which revealed that only
                            15-20 percent of fresh soldiers
                            shot to kill. The rest
                            aimed high, didn't fire at all, or
                            pretended to be busy doing
                            something else.
               Bullets still flying above her head, the Woman stops
               running, crouches down and RETURNS FIRE.
               Bill is SHOT, stumbles backwards and falls into the mud,
               his finger still stuck in his M-16. He lies there,
               staring up at the sky, his expression one of puzzlement,
               as a huge blood stain spreads over his chest.
               BILL'S P.O.V - the edges of our vision darken down as the
               sound FADES OUT. The darkness flows inwards, as if an
               IRIS IS CLOSING DOWN - until only a PIN-POINT OF WHITE
               LIGHT remains in the centre of the sky. We begin to move
               towards the light, slowly at first and then faster and
               faster. Just as we are about to reach it, a VISION OF THE
               FACE OF the VC WOMAN appears, filling the white disc.

                         Chief of Staff for the Army,

                         What Bill hadn't told the Pentagon
                         was that he was really looking for
                         the answer to the riddle of his
                         vision. How could his men's
                         gentleness, their general lack of
                         interest in killing people, how
                         could this be turned into a
                         strength? How could love and peace
                         help win wars? Bill knew where to
                         go to find out.

                            Pretty mind-blowing, isn't it?
                            First time I read it, I was
                            like...what the fuck?

                            Well it's just...it's hard to
                            believe the Pentagon paid for

                            interesting, but there's nothing
                            in here that's actually

                         The New Earth Army was tasked with
                         preventing conflict. We're a force
                         of peace, not war. Bill realized

                         you've got to start by changing
                         the armies. He was the one that

               Before he can finish Lyn has slipped Bob's finger into a
               hole in the middle of the blob and twisted it.

                         You see? You're mine now. The
                         Predator is completely
                         biodegradable. It's friendly to
                         the earth but it can hurt you in a
                         hundred ways.
               He takes the blob off the finger and rubs it's serrated
               edge down Bob's temple.

                                         BOB

               Lyn sticks the Predator in Bob's ear and hauls him to his
               feet. Bob yells with pain.

                         I bought it on line. What's cool
                         about it is that you could see
                         this lying on the ground and you'd

               from his bag and is preparing an INJECTION.

                            Vietnam has crushed our soul. We
                            are traumatized and melancholic.
                            We are ashamed. That is why I have
                            brought you to this place of
                            Sanctuary. Here we can mend our
                            wounds and dream our dreams. My
                            dream is of an America that
                            will lead the world to paradise,
                            an America that no longer has an
                            exploitative view of natural
                            resources, that no longer promotes
                            consumption at all costs. I
                            believe this is America's destiny.

                            There was no attempt, sir. It
                            seems the story was a French hoax.
                            But the Russians think the story
                            about the story being a French
                            hoax is just a story sir.

                Bob wakes, stiff and cold, in the front of the car. He
                sits up and looks around, trying to work out where he is.
                Suddenly he realizes he is ALONE. Afraid, he scans the
                landscape around him - featureless desert stretches to
                the horizon.

               He concentrates on the CLOUD again. Sure enough, it thins
               and fades until it has DISAPPEARED. Bob stares - not sure
               what to think.

               is veering off the road a little.
               BANG! The two men are slammed forward as the car hits

               We see the car has run straight into a large ROCK. This
               is pretty much the only vertical feature in the otherwise
               flat landscape.
               The two men stand staring at the wrecked front of the
               car. Bob is holding a handkerchief to his bloody nose. He
               looks at the car, stares around him at the desert
               stretching out.

               He stops, listening. We hear the sound of an approaching
               ENGINE. The two men turn to see a WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK
               approaching.

               Bob scuttles into the middle of the road, waving
               frantically. The pick-up slows and pulls over. A YOUNG
               IRAQI MAN looks out at them.

                            rock. Could you take us to a town
                            or someplace?
               Smiling, the Iraqi gestures to the back of the pick-up.

               He grabs his case and climbs up onto the back of the

               up his bag and follows Bob.

               The two Young Men smile in a friendly fashion.

          

          

          

                                                                 (CONTINUED)

                            Don't know if we would have lasted
                            much longer. Phew!
               One of the Young Men nods, smiling. He reaches casually
               forward and takes Lyn's BAG from him. Lyn just sits
               there, resigned as the Young Man roots through the
               contents.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)

                                 (OBLIVIOUS)
                            Yeah, it gets pretty hot out here,
                            huh?
               The Young Man takes out a ROCK COMPILATION CD from Lyn's
               bag and inspects it.

                                          YOUNG IRAQI
                                 (to the other)
                            Deep Purple.
               They laugh.

                                          BOB
                                 (laughing too)
                            Oh, you speak English? Great. Deep
                            Purple. Right. You guys like Deep
                            Purple? You like rock or, or...
               He suddenly notices the Young Iraqi is holding a HANDGUN.
               The Driver leans out the window and shouts something over
               the roar of the engine. The Young Man next to Lyn takes
               off his scarf and starts to blindfold Lyn with it.

                                          BOB (CONT'D)
                                 (smile fading)
                            Lyn? Is this...is this...?

          57   INT. ROOM - NIGHT                                          57

               Bob and Lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the
               otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from
               the small window above them. From next door comes the
               faint sound of a period song playing. Bob is losing it.

                                          BOB
                            We're going to die! I'm going to
                            be killed by Al Qaeda!

          

          

          

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

          

                                                                       41.

               From the next room we hear the Young Iraqis start to sing
               along to the track, laughing. Lyn listens.

                                          LYN CASSADY
                            I don't think they're Al Qaeda.

                                          BOB
                            Oh what the hell do you know? You
                            don't know! You don't know
                            anything! And this is all your
                            fault!

                                          LYN CASSADY
                            Bob, there's something I have to
                            tell you. When I said I was
                            retired from the unit, that was a
                            lie. I'm on a mission. DeWitts was
                            just my cover. I've been
                            reactivated. I couldn't tell
                            you because this is a Black Op,
                            but...I think you have a part to
                            play. I think that's why you're
                            with me.
               Bob collapses face down on the mattress.

                                          BOB

                                 (MUFFLED)
                            You're an idiot. You want to know
                            why I'm with you? Because I got
                            drunk. (Starting to cry a little)
                            I got drunk and I just wanted to
                            get into Iraq so I could prove to
                            my wife I wasn't...just once that
                            I...And now I'm going to die.
                            She's right. I'm such a...
               He dissolves into misery. Lyn watches with sympathy.

                            Your life is like a river, Bob. If
                            you're aiming for a goal
                            that isn't your destiny, you will
                            always be swimming against the
                            current. Young Ghandi wants to be
                            a stock-car racer? Not gonna
                            happen. Little Anne Frank wants to
                            be a High School teacher. Tough
                            titty Anne. That's not your
                            destiny. But you will go on to
                            move the hearts and minds of
                            millions. Find out what your
                            destiny is and the river will
                            carry you. Now sometimes events in
                            life give an individual clues as
                            to where their Destiny lies.

                         Like those doodles you just
                         "happened" to draw?
               He unbuttons his shirt and reveals an EYE tattooed on his
               chest - very similar to the one Bob had drawn. Bob looks
               up.

                         This is the Ajna chakra - the
                         third eye - the symbol of the
                         Jedi. When I saw you'd drawn
                         it...well, the Universe gives me a
                         sign like that, I don't ignore it.
                         You're meant to be here
                         with me, Bob. The Jedi inside you
                         sensed that.
               Bob stares at the EYE.

                         Now listen to me. I don't think
                         these guys are FRL's or Mehdi
                         Army... I think we're talking
                         standard criminals here, okay?
                         What they're gonna do is try and
                         sell us on to another group. We
                         can't let that happen.

                         How are we gonna stop them?
                         There's three of them! And they've
                         got guns!

                         fight with guns. We fight with our
                         minds.

                         Let's say we have no choice but to
                         fight with these men. Then
                         we use visual aesthetics to
                         instill psychically in the enemy a
                         disincentive to attack.

                         you say "No, I'm not going to
                         attack you." You totally relax
                         your body and your voice. And then
                         you rip out one of his eyeballs.

                         See? I hardly moved. Physics wise
                         there's not much going on. It's
                         the psychic energy that's
                         important. (Beat) You okay?

                         Would you say that level of fear
                         was abnormal for you?
               Bob thinks about this.

                                       BOB
                         I don't know. I was pretty
                         terrified anyway but the fear I
                         felt on the run-up to the choking
                         did seem, you know, unusual.

               A TWELVE YEAR OLD LYN - is dancing away to a track on
               the radio. His FATHER weaves drunkenly past the door and
               stops, watching.

                            Stop acting so fucking QUEER!
               He throws his beer can at Lyn and walks on. Lyn stares
               after him, upset. The RADIO abruptly catches FIRE.

               Bill watches Lyn with compassion.

                            Well, I'm your commanding officer
                            Lyn, and I'm ordering you to let
                            the dance out!
               Lyn starts to dance with a little more abandon.

                                           BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
                            C'mon goddamit! DANCE! Let it go!
                            Let it all go!
               Lyn starts to go for it. And it's true - he CAN dance.

               Lyn smiles shyly.

                            afraid there's no coffee budget.
                            Bring your own coffee. Oh, and no

               The Jedis stand watching a JEEP driving down a course
               marked out on the field.

               Bill sits next to a nervous JEDI TRAINEE who is driving.
               The Jedi is BLINDFOLDED.

                                       BILL DJANGO

                              (CALMLY)

               The Jedis SCATTER as the jeep swerves erratically off the
               course and drives straight towards them...

               The Jedis examine a blackboard on which Bill is writing:
               "Before going into Battle the JEDI utilizes A) Yogic Cat
               Stretch. B) Primal scream and leap. C) Belgian waffle. D)

               The Jedis stare doubtfully at the bed of HOT COALS in
               front of them. One JEDI stands ready, his feet bare.

                                       BILL DJANGO
                         Okay, only when you're ready.
               The Jedi nods nervously, hesitates, starts to WALK ON THE
               COALS, almost immediately starts to SCREAM.

               Bill leads the Jedis in another dancing session - rock
               music blasting - the men dancing in a variety of nerdish
               and demented ways. Their uniforms have been supplemented
               with odd, personal touches: hats, badges, sunglasses, a
               poncho...
               We find Lyn dancing in blissful, idiotic abandonment.

                            After years of feeling like an
                            oddball Lyn had finally found a
                            home. At last he was amongst men
                            who prided themselves on being
                            different.

               complex YOGA MOVE. We CLOSE on LYN.

                            These were Golden Days for Lyn.
                            There was something so noble and
                            pure in Bill's vision that the
                            Jedis felt themselves inspired to
                            be more than soldiers. In a world
                            torn apart by greed and hate they
                            would be a force for good, for
                            peace.
               A BUTTERFLY lands on Lyn's outstretched hand. He watches
               it with a gentle smile.

                            felt truly happy.
               The Butterfly flits away and lands on an APPLE in the
               tree overhead.

               GUESTS sit eating dinner around the large table.
               Brigadier General Hopgood is talking to his WIFE. He
               turns back to find the FORK in his hand BENT DOUBLE.
               He looks in amazement at the man sitting beside him -

               LARRY HOOPER.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            Larry Hooper was a failed Sci-Fi
                            writer from Colorado, recruited to
                            the Jedis after Brigadier General
                            Hopgood met him at a spoon-bending
                            party.
               Other guests laugh and applaud.

               A WEDDING CELEBRATION is in progress. SCOTTY MERCER - one
               of the JEDI RECRUITS - is dancing, beaming with his new
               BRIDE. Guests - Lyn and the other Jedis amongst them -
               stand watching, clapping and cheering, a boisterous
               atmosphere of bonhomie. Larry watches the revellers with
               contempt.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            Right from the start he had made
                            himself unpopular with the other
                            Jedis.
               Scotty and his wife are walking off the dance floor.
               Larry stops him to shake his hand.

                                          LARRY HOOPER
                            Congratulations Scotty. I'm sorry
                            it doesn't work out for you two.
               Scotty's face falls. The other Jedis glare at Larry. One
               of them makes a move towards him but Lyn holds him back.

          

                                                                       53.

               The Jedis eat at one table. Larry sits alone and shunned
               at another table. Lyn walks over with a tray, hesitates
               seeing Larry alone.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         Larry made it quite clear that he
                         despised most of the other Jedis.
               Feeling sorry for him Lyn sits beside Larry. Larry
               flushes red.

                                       BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         But Lyn - Lyn was different.
                         (Beat) He really hated Lyn.

          

          82   INT. PSI EXPERIMENT ROOM - DAY - THE PAST                 82

               Scotty, Larry and Lyn sit focusing on a wall of SMALL
               WOODEN CUPBOARDS. Each cupboard has a letter and number
               printed on its door.

                         A-9.
               The three men focus on the cupboard in question.

                                       SCOTTY
                         It's...it's something cylindrical?
                         I think it's a pencil?

                                        BILL DJANGO
                         Okay. Larry?
               Larry rolls his eyes up in his head, speaks in a high
               wavering voice with a bad cockney accent.

                         the cupboard now and I'm
                         seeing...I'm seeing...a tin mug?

                         Lyn?
               Lyn stares at his hands, focused. He looks up suddenly,
               puzzled.

                                       LYN CASSADY
                         It's a man on a chair.
               Bill unlocks the little cupboard and takes a photograph
               of the Lincoln Memorial. There are murmurs of admiration
               from the watching Jedis.

                            Oh, no, wait. See, I thought you
                            said K, not A!
               Bill ignores him, smiles at Lyn.

                                          BILL DJANGO
                            Bravo Zulu, Lyn. Outstanding.
               Larry looks daggers at Lyn.

               Lyn is walking calmly over the HOT COALS as the other
               Jedis watch, impressed.

          

          84   INT. GYM - DAY - THE PAST                                 84

               Bill is leading the Jedis in AIKIDO.

                                          BILL DJANGO
                            Aikido is a vehicle for
                            harmonizing ourselves with the
                            Universe and the Way. Look upon
                            these sessions as an opportunity
                            to discover yourself and your
                            training partner in a loving
                            environment.

               LATER
               Larry flails violently at Lyn. Lyn FLIPS him with ease.
               Larry gets up and CHARGES bellowing at Lyn who FLIPS him
               out of the frame. Bill joins Lyn.

                            Notice how Lyn's circular motions
                            turned Larry's
                            aggression back upon him. Good
                            work Lyn.
               A CHAIR flies through the frame, just missing Lyn's head.

               Lyn lies on a couch drinking a beer, staring at a large
               BROWN ENVELOPE. Bill sits beside him with pad and paper.

               Lyn opens the envelope and stares at the PHOTOGRAPH of
               the NATO GENERAL inside.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            After a year's training, Lyn was
                            given his first tasking. A senior
                            Nato General had been kidnapped by
                            Red Brigade members in Italy. Bill
                            was unofficially
                            asked if his unit would be able to
                            help find him before it was too
                            late.

                                 (CONCENTRATING)
                            We're north of Verona. It's a
                            little town. There's a lake
                            nearby. I can see a Cinema. Across
                            from the Cinema is a shop or,
                            or...it's a cafe. He's in the
                            apartment above. The town is
                            called...it's something sweet.
                            (Beat) Dolce. It's called Dolce.
               Bill looks proudly over to where an important looking
               OFFICIAL watches from the next room. The Official looks
               impressed.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            It's true that the unit never
                            found out whether any of their
                            remote viewings were accurate or
                            not. Nevertheless from that moment
                            on Lyn's reputation soared.

          

          86   INT. EX-MESS HALL - DAY                                   86

               Lyn stands in front of the other Jedis.

                                          BILL DJANGO
                            Rank, medals...these things mean
                            little to the Jedi. But growth in
                            spirit, in wisdom, in psychic
                            power, these things earn our
                            respect.
               He presents Lyn with an EAGLE FEATHER.

                                          BILL DJANGO (CONT'D)
                            Native Americans believed that
                            when one received an Eagle
                            feather, it was the mark of love,
                            of gratitude and ultimate respect.
                            Only true Human Beings may carry
                            the Eagle feather.
               He gives the feather to a deeply moved Lyn, as the other
               Jedis applaud. Larry watches Lyn with HATE.

               Lyn lies on the couch, drinking another beer, the Eagle
               Feather on a chain around his neck. A period song is
               playing in the room.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         The word soon got out in the
                         intelligence community that there
                         was a sergeant at Fort Bragg who
                         could find whatever you needed
                         found. It was as if Lyn could fly
                         anywhere in the world without
                         leaving his room.
               We TRACK INTO LYN'S EYE - UNTIL WE ARE INSIDE HIS MIND.
               LYN'S MIND P.O.V - We move towards the wall.

                         truly was strong with this one.
               As the song breaks into the chorus we burst through the
               wall, into freedom...

               faster and faster, free as a bird, swooping up towards a
               huge SUN, until the screens WHITES OUT and we...

               next to another TRUCK.
               Two MEN dressed in black with their kaffiyeh covering
               their faces stand by it staring at them. In the back seat
               of the Truck sits a blindfolded IRAQI MAN.
               The Driver of the Pick-Up crosses to the TWO INSURGENTS
               with a half-gallon bottle of WATER and passes it to them.
               They drink and confer briefly in Arabic. He turns and
               gestures to the other two Young Iraqis who push Lyn and
               Bob down from the back of the pick-up. Lyn stands still.

                            into that truck.
               The First Young Iraqi gestures more angrily at the Truck.

                            that.
               One of the Insurgents stirs and says something softly in
               Arabic. The other laughs. Angrily the First Young Iraqi
               takes out a HANDGUN and levels it at Lyn.

                                             YOUNG IRAQI

                            EDKHOL!
               Lyn raises one hand towards him.

                            You can put your weapon away.
                            You're not interested in us.
               The Young Iraqi points the gun at Bob who starts to walk
               towards the truck.

               Apparently having had enough one the Insurgents pulls his
               own GUN out and aims at Lyn. The tension builds. Suddenly
               Bob remembers the phrase he was taught.

               Immediately everyone stares at Bob. The Insurgent OPENS
               FIRE at him.
               Terrified Bob, dives across the sand. The Young Iraqi
               behind him also scrambles for cover.
               Still firing, the Insurgent is suddenly aware of Lyn
               sprinting towards him. Before he can turn to aim at him,
               Lyn LEAPS into the air, spinning around, face contorted
               as he emits a bizarre SHRIEK.
               We FREEZE-FRAME ON HIM, HUNG IN MID-AIR.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         Ben Echmeyer was a Vietnam vet
                         with sixty-three confirmed kills.
                         He remains the only non-Korean to
                         achieve the rank of Master in Kwa
                         Ra Do. He was one of the Jedi
                         teachers at Fort Bragg.

               watching with expressions of mingled admiration and
               horror.

                         It was said he could have a tug of
                         war with a dozen men and not move
                         an inch.
               We PAN DOWN the back of BEN and find he is NAKED from the
               waist down. A SAND BAG is somehow hanging between his
               legs.

                                       BOB (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                         He was also able to lift bags of
                         sand on hooks hung through his
                         scrotum.

                            Sir, what's the practical
                            application of this?

               OVER-HEAD SHOT - Ben lies on the ground staring up at us.
               We hear the sound of an approaching engine.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            Another demonstration involved
                            letting a recruit drive a jeep
                            over him. This, in the end, was to
                            be his undoing.
               Next second a JEEP roars straight over Ben, going at
               sixty miles an hour.
               We FREEZE FRAME on the JEEP.

                            Before his untimely death Ben
                            caused quite a stir by advocating
                            his controversial "shock and awe"

               Ben leaps spastically in the air, spinning and shrieking,
               a knife held in one hand.

                                          BOB (V.O.)
                            The approach was hailed by some
                            knife aficionados as revolutionary
                            but criticized by others who
                            believed that the leaping and
                            spinning might lead you to
                            accidentally stab yourself.

               We reach LYN who TURNS TO CAMERA.

                            Ben, you're not forgotten. The
                            knife you gave me lies next to my
                            beret. God bless Ben Echmeyer.

          93   EXT. DESERT - EARLY MORNING                               93

               We UN-FREEZE ON LYN - as he whirls and shrieks towards
               the Insurgent. Bob watches amazed from where he lies on
               the sand.

                                       BOB (V.O.)
                         Of course, Lyn didn't actually
                         have a knife with him at this
                         particular time...so I still think
                         what he did was kinda...reckless.
               The Insurgent, understandably startled, flinches
               backwards, trips over the water bottle and falls on his
               ass.
               Lyn scoops up the gallon bottle of water and begins to
               POUND the fallen man with it. The Young Iraqi moves to
               intervene but Lyn smacks him in the face with the bottle.
               The BLINDFOLDED IRAQI IN THE TRUCK manages to open the
               door and stumbles out, claws his blindfold off and races
               away over the sand.
               The second Insurgent is distracted for a moment by his
               victim's flight. When he turns back Lyn has scooped up
               the Insurgent's GUN and is aiming it at him.
               Beat. Nobody moves.

          

          94   EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER                                 94

               The sun is rising as the PICK-UP TRUCK roars over the
               sand and swerves onto the road.

               INSIDE THE TRUCK
               Lyn drives. Bob is leaning out of the window, staring at
               the road behind them.

                         God, we're gonna be okay!
               The Truck crests a hill and we see the IRAQI MAN running
               desperately down the road ahead of us, his hands tied.

                                        LYN CASSADY
                         There he is.
               He puts his foot down and the truck roars after the
               running man.

               him.

                            We're here to help you!
               Terrified the Man sprints faster. Lyn tries to pass him,
               but the Man veers at the same time and the truck CLIPS
               him, sending him flying.

               IN THE TRUCK

               Lyn runs over to where the MAN lies moaning on the road,
               his head bleeding.

                                          LYN CASSADY

                            give me a hand here will you?
               Bob gets out and the two lift the Iraqi Man and begin to
               carry him back towards the truck.
               They stop listening to an approaching rumble.

                            Oh shit! Oh shit, they're coming!
               They scuttle faster back towards the truck, the Iraqi Man
               dangling between them.
               Next second, two GLEAMING WHITE SUVs crest the hill and
               roar towards them. Seeing the road blocked by the truck,
               the SUVs screech to a halt and several MEN IN FLAK
               JACKETS AND SUNGLASSES tumble out in formation, aiming
               their M-16's at Lyn and Bob.
               ARMED MEN'S P.O.V - Lyn and Bob stare at them before
               dropping the bound Iraqi on the ground. Bob waves
               nervously.

               Tigress and Euphrates towards a GLEAMING CITY rising from

               Bob and the Iraqi Man sit beside TODD NIXON - a suit. Lyn
               sits behind in between two of the PRIVATE SECURITY
               GUARDS, who are nodding along to the music playing in the
               car.
               Nixon, holding the LAPTOP for Bob to see, watches the

                            time I see it, it gets me.

               dressing to the cut on his forehead, pale and shaken.

                            French! (Laughing) Did you hear
                            that shit? Chirac wants to bring
                            French contractors in? Can you
                            believe that? Hey, Phil? Raise one
                            hand if you like the French.

                            French!
               He raises both his hands.

               Lyn prepares an INJECTION for himself. He feels the
               Security Guard beside him watching. He notices the name
               of the company on the man's badge - Krom Security.

               The SUV's are approaching a town and other cars have
               appeared on the road. The Security Men on either side
               instantly lean out of their windows with their M-16's -
               aiming them at the cars which swerve out of their way in

               A LONG line of cars are waiting for gas - Iraqi men,
               women and children, suffering in the heat. Many of them
               have been there for hours. The SUVs approach.

                         station here. Are we waiting?

                         We're taking the station. Go in

          99   EXT. GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS                             99

               ...as the two SUV's roar up, horns blaring, M-16's
               bristling from the windows. The lead SUV rams the car at
               the head of the line and sweeps it out of its path.
               Nixon's SUV barrels through the gap and screeches to a
               halt by the pumps. The THREE SECURITY MEN roll out
               showily, machine guns ready.

                         Secure the perimeter!
               The men fan out to the corners of the station, while the
               first SUV blocks the road and more SECURITY pile out,
               guns raised to cover the line of cars. There are howls of
               protest from the waiting Iraqis.
               Inside the SUV Bob, Lyn and Mahmud watch in astonishment.

                Another SUV - identical, but black, is passing, hemmed in
                by traffic. A stray BULLET from the gas-station pings off
                it's armor plating. Immediately it screeches to a halt
                and a NEW DETACHMENT OF SECURITY MEN roll from the car -
                same flak-jackets and Oakley sunglasses but different
                color uniforms.

                             They're really good.
                Bob nods politely. Mahmud nods, sighs.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             I understood he was going     through
                             a lot, but considering we     had
                             saved him from kidnappers     I still
                             thought his welcome could     have
                             been a little warmer.
                Lyn clears his throat.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             I'm very sorry for running you
                             over, sir.
                Mahmud shrugs.

                             It was an accident.

                             detachment. Please don't think all
                             Americans are like that.
                Mahmud nods. Beat.

                          Not your fault sir. I mean we get
                          kidnappers in America too,
                          so...you know. There's always, uh,
                          bad apples, right?
                The men eat in silence for a moment. Mahmud stares
                blankly at his plate, looking crumpled and lost. Bob
                watches him, faintly irritated. Lyn tries to think of
                something comforting to say.

                Mahmud looks at him, startled perhaps by the unexpected
                Arabic phrase.

                on it, trying to "bust" it. Nothing happens. He sighs,

                          Lyn was thinking of Larry Hooper
                          and the part he had played in the
                          destruction of the New earth Army.
                          But, in fairness, the Jedis' own
                          eccentricities hadn't exactly won
                          them many allies in the Army.
                A JEDI - TIM KOOTZ - lies on the couch in a TRANCE, Bill
                sitting beside him with pen and paper.

                          For example, there was Tim Kootz
                          who, on being asked to ascertain
                          the whereabouts of General Manuel

                             he was called to the disciplinary

                             Lieutenant Colonel Django used

                             budget to procure prostitutes...
                The OFFICIALS listening register shock and dismay. Bill
                stands up, outraged.

                                             BILL DJANGO
                             That's a lie!

                Bill jumps to his feet again.

                             That's a...(catches himself) Well
                             the hooker thing is definitely a

                The OFFICIALS look at him as if he were SATAN himself.

                Bill, a broken man, is walking off the base. He reaches
                the gates and sees Lyn waiting for him.

                                           BILL DJANGO
                             Continue the work, Lyn. The World

                             ever.
                Lyn can't speak. Bill hugs him and walks off, the gates
                closing after him.

                The Jedis sit having their hair shaved with electric
                clippers. The Jedi's NEW COMMANDER - MAJOR HOLTZ - not a
                shred of New Age sympathy in his regulation heart - walks
                down the line, examining his men coldly.

                          After Bill left, Major Holtz of
                          Special Forces took command of the
                          Jedis.
                Lyn stares at his reflection as his long hair falls to
                the floor.

                Bob wakes up, listening to the sound of Lyn's laboured
                breathing.
                Across the room Lyn sits, sweating with pain, preparing
                an injection. We see he has used the LAST OF THE
                MEDICINE. He injects himself, his breathing beginning to
                ease and sits staring at the empty VIAL. Bob watches for
                a moment then shuts his eyes, feigning sleep.

                Lyn and Bob are waiting on the quiet road which is
                studded with burnt out CARS.
                Mahmud drives an old Renault out of a warehouse and over
                to them. He gets out the car and hands Lyn the keys.

                                        LYN CASSADY
                          I really appreciate this sir.

                Lyn watches Mahmud in the mirror as they drive away. He
                stands in the middle of the road, staring at his feet.
                They drive on.

                Lyn sits staring out at the emptiness, looking, perhaps
                for the first time, worried.

                to stare at Bob.

                He hauls Bob to his feet, puts his baseball cap on him
                and pulls him onto his back. Bob hangs there limply as
                Lyn sets off again.

                Lyn reaches up and gropes at Bob's face, removing his
                spectacles. Bob doesn't notice.

                                           BOB
                             Where are we going? We should stay
                             with the car so the army can find
                             us.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             Fedayeen will find us first.

                                           BOB
                             Well, I disagree. I totally
                             disagree.(Beat) The Federal what?

                                            LYN CASSADY
                             Fedayeen Saddam. Paramilitary.
                             Fellas who probably laid the IED.
                             They could be on their way now.
                             Hold this Bob.
                He passes Bob his backpack. They stagger on in silence
                for a moment, Bob jogging up and down on Lyn's back. Lyn
                snaps the legs off Bob's glasses, uses them as improvised
                divining rods to scan the sand ahead.

                                           BOB

                             Could be IED's or mines around
                             here. I'm checking for
                             disturbances in the telluric
                             current.

                             Are they my glasses?
                Lyn doesn't answer, keeps on walking, struggling a little
                under the weight. Beat.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             Jesus, it's hot. I'm so hot.
                             (Beat) Aren't you hot?

                             Bob? It's pretty important you
                             keep your mouth closed, okay? You
                             can lose a lot of water through an
                             open mouth.
                He staggers on with him.

          

                                                                        79.

                Bob trails after Lyn, his shirt tied around his head,
                breathing hard. Lyn is still scanning the sand.

                                        BOB
                          I can't breathe properly. I
                          can't...Oh boy...
                He staggers, manages not to fall.

                                         LYN CASSADY
                          You're okay.

                          I think I'm bleeding to death.

                          You're not bleeding to death, Bob.
                          It's shock, okay? It's just the
                          shock. It'll pass. You're gonna be
                          okay.

                          up! I'm in the middle of a desert!

                          Bob, you're suffering from shock.
                          If you start panicking now your
                          heart's gonna stop.
                Bob stares after him incredulously.

                Lyn walks on without answering. Bob notices the sun is
                sinking.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             Wait a minute. That's west. Al
                             Qaim's in that direction. We're
                             going the wrong way.

                             joke? We've come six hundred miles

                             a Jedi to find them, would it?
                Bob watches Lyn stare around him, looking pale and drawn
                and, for the first time, afraid.

                             projection. I could hear him
                             calling my name.
                Bob is so staggered by this for a moment he can't speak.

                Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the
                shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to
                him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with
                pain.

                             not the business of the Army. So
                             you girls better start thinking
                             about how you CAN engage in the
                             business of the United States
                             Army, which, in case you have
                             forgotten, involves winning
                             fucking wars!

                             When the dust of the Pendleton
                             Affair had settled it revealed a
                             surprising victor.

          

          132   INT. MAJOR HOLTZ'S OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                132

                Larry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT
                held under one arm.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper
                             as a patriotic whistle-blower and
                             the one sound fruit in an
                             otherwise dubious barrel of
                             apples.

                                           LARRY HOOPER
                             It's some scientific research I've
                             done for possible offensive psi
                             applications sir. (Beat) I did
                             show the report to Lieutenant
                             Colonel Django, but he didn't seem
                             interested.
                Holtz snorts angrily.

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                             I bet he wasn't.
                He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause.
                He looks up slowly at Larry.

                                           MAJOR HOLTZ (CONT'D)
                             We have men who can do this?

                                           LARRY HOOPER
                                  (a sly smile)
                             I think I know one sir.
                Holtz ponders the report, tempted.

                                           MAJOR HOLTZ
                             But we don't have the resources.

                                           LARRY HOOPER
                             Well sir...there is goat lab?

          

          133   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                   133

                The building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred
                GOATS stare silently at us.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             Goat Lab was originally created as
                             a clandestine laboratory to
                             provide in-the-field surgical
                             training for Special Forces
                             soldiers.
                We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their
                legs in PLASTER.

                                           BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             The goats would get shot in the
                             leg with a bolt gun and then a
                             trainee would have to dress the
                             wound successfully. Goat lab
                             actually used to be called Dog
                             Lab...

          

          134   SMALL DOG STARING AT US                                    134

                             But it turned out most soldiers
                             didn't feel good shooting dogs in
                             the leg...
                A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in
                hand.

          

                                                                      84.

                A Goat stands tethered in the desert. TITLES read "Nevada
                Test Site, Frenchman Flat, 1951."

                          even testing atomic weapons on
                          them.
                We hear the drone of an AEROPLANE high, high above. The
                goat looks up...

          

          136   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST               136

                Lyn stands facing the goats. Holtz and Hooper watch him.
                Lyn STARES. One of the goats STARES BACK. Lyn STARES. The
                goat STARES BACK. Lyn STARES.
                And the Goat falls over.

                                           MAJOR HOLTZ

                               (SOFTLY)
                          Holy shit.
                Beat. The goat gets back up, shakes itself and walks off.
                Lyn slumps.

                Bob listens transfixed.

                          This was the real deal, Bob. I was
                          at the Gateway. Afterwards I
                          realized I'd got injured.

                          Huh?

                          Sympathetic injury I guess. I was
                          bruised all over.

                                        BOB
                          So, it's not that the goat fought
                          back?

                             we should try the experiment
                             again. Only this time they
                             said...kill the goat.

                Six GOATS - each wearing a NUMBERED BIB - stand in a
                small bare room. A SOLDIER is setting up a VIDEO CAMERA

                Lyn sits in another bare room. Holtz and Larry Hooper
                stand watching him. Lyn is also being TAPED. A SOLDIER
                walks in carrying an envelope. Holtz takes the envelope
                and draws from it a piece of paper. He shows it to Lyn -
                the number FOUR.

                Lyn stares at the number.

                             Lyn said he had no intention of
                             killing the goat.

                Lyn flushes with indignation at the memory.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             There was no way! What had the
                             goat ever done to me? It was
                             totally against the way of the
                             Jedi. I was just going to pretend
                             to try so they would say, "okay -
                             it can't be done" and forget about
                             it. But then, as I sat there, I
                             felt this, this pulse start inside
                             of me and...I couldn't stop it.
                He turns to look at Bob, haunted.

                             it. I'd used my powers for evil
                             and it was like I brought a curse
                             upon us all. Like that poem where

                             make him wear it round his neck.
                             Every night

                by his solemn expression.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             I finished my tour and I quit. I
                             walked out of the unit and I never
                             went back.

          

          145   EXT. FORT BRAGG - DAY                                       145

                Lyn, wearing civilian clothes and holding a suitcase, is
                walking off the base. He reaches the gates and turns for
                one last look at the place that has been his home.

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             But before he could leave Larry
                             arranged one last parting gift.
                Lyn tuns back to the gates and finds Larry Hooper
                standing in front of him, looking WIRED.

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             What do you wan...?
                Before he can finish Larry CHOPS his hand down in an odd
                blow onto Lyn's forehead. Lyn staggers back a little,
                holding his head.

                                              LYN CASSADY (CONT'D)
                             What the hell?
                Larry has already darted around him with a crazy laugh
                and is running madly back into the base. Lyn stares after
                him, stunned.

                                           LYN CASSADY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             It was the Dim Mak.

                Bob looks at Lyn, puzzled.

                                              BOB
                             The Dim Mak?

                                            LYN CASSADY
                             There's a story that Wong Wifu,
                             great Chinese martial artist, had
                             a fight with some guy and had him
                             beat when the guy gave him this
                             light tap, and Wong looked at him
                             and the guy just nodded. That was
                             it. He'd given him the death touch
                             and Wong died.

                                           BOB
                             Then and there?

                                           LYN CASSADY
                             No. Eighteen years later. That's
                             the weird thing with Dim Mak - you
                             never know when it's going to take
                             effect.
                He flops back, too tired to talk anymore. Bob watches him
                as he falls asleep.

                                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

          

          147   EXT. DESERT - MORNING                                      147

                The same horizon, the dunes now burning under the sun. We
                TRACK back and find Bob and Lyn lying asleep, lips
                cracked, dehydrated, exhausted. Faintly we hear a sound -
                a tinny BELL. It gets closer. Groggily Bob opens his eyes
                just as a GOAT walks into the frame and walks past him,
                the bell tied around its neck. Bob lies, watching it
                pass, trying to work out if it's a hallucination. He
                struggles to his feet and sets off up the berm he's been
                lying at the foot of.
                The goat walks on ahead of Bob, crests the top of the
                berm and disappears from sight.
                Bob reaches the top of the berm and stands, swaying,
                staring down at something.
                CLOSE ON BOB'S FACE - stunned.

          

                                                                        89.

                Bob is dragging a barely conscious Lyn up the berm,
                following the goat. He staggers, barely able to put one
                foot in front of the other.
                At last we crest the top of the berm and find ourselves
                looking down on a WATER-HOLE, fringed with palms. The
                goat stands drinking. It stops to look up at us.

          

          149   EXT. WATER-HOLE - DAY                                    149

                Bob and Lyn collapse into the wet mud of the hole. Bob
                manages to cup some water into Lyn's mouth and then his
                own. He rolls onto his back, stares up at the burning
                sky.
                We hear a dull roaring, muffled, growing in volume. A
                HELICOPTER is approaching...

                                                                   FADE OUT.
                In the BLACK we hear a VOICE.

                OVERHEAD SHOT - Lyn and Bob lie side by side in beds,
                both hooked up to IV's. Sunlight slants through the
                shutters on the window in the cool room. The voice is
                coming from a SPEAKER on the wall.

                                        ARMY BROADCASTER (O.S.)
                          This is democracy. Let us work
                          together for that. And please stop
                          shooting at those who are only
                          here to help.
                Lyn opens his eyes, looks around him.

                Lyn looks at the door and for a second there's a FLASH OF
                A FACE staring in through the glass. Then it's gone.

                Over the speaker comes the sound of a period song.
                Lyn sits up, staring at the door. Bob stirs in his bed.

                Lyn walks unsteadily out of the room, towing his IV drip
                behind him.
                The door at the end of the corridor is just CLOSING. Lyn
                sets off down the corridor. Bob appears in the doorway
                behind him, towing his own IV.

                Lyn passes doors, glances into the rooms beyond...
                LYN'S P.O.V - the room seems to house a PRINTING PRESS. A
                SOLDIER stands with his back to us, watching LEAFLETS
                fire out of the press.
                We pass to the next room which seems to be a RECORDING
                STUDIO - the walls covered in shelves of CD's. A SOLDIER
                sits with headphones on playing an electronic keyboard...

          

          153   EXT. ARMY BASE BUILDING - DAY                            153

                Lyn emerges blinking into the light. He stares around
                him. The song is playing over speakers, echoing eerily
                around the base.
                A door slides shut with a clang nearby and Lyn turns to
                locate the sound.
                A trail of FOOTPRINTS leads across the sand to a HANGAR
                nearby.
                Lyn heads off across the sand, dragging the IV. Bob
                emerges behind him.

                Lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags
                them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior.
                Bob catches him up.

                He stops following Lyn's gaze...

                INSIDE THE BUILDING
                The place is full of GOATS.
                Lyn and Bob stare at the animals. Slowly Lyn advances
                into the darkness, peering around him.
                In the shadows at the back of the building a figure
                STIRS. Lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the
                man - old, bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy
                drinking. It's BILL DJANGO.
                Lyn stares at him.

                             Hello Lyn.
                Lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer.

                Bob is too amazed to reply.

                Bob and Lyn turn to find Larry Hooper standing in the
                doorway behind them.

                Bob picks up a LEAFLET.

                             Oh, that's an Iraqi Psyops leaflet
                             they dropped on us.

                Lyn is staring at Bill who is looking a little vacantly
                at the racks of CD's. Larry notices.

                             doing here?

                          Bill's been looking into
                          subliminal messaging. (Selecting a

                          combat.
                He puts the disc in a player and presses play. We hear a
                burst of a period song.

                towards the door.

                          burnt out with the booze.
                Larry shakes his head in apparent sorrow. Then he notices
                some candy on a desk.

                Bob helps Lyn down the corridor. Lyn suddenly stops,
                listening. There is a faint sound of MUSIC coming from
                somewhere nearby.

          

          156   INT. BASE - CELL CORRIDOR - DAY                          156

                Lyn walks down the corridor, Bob following. At the end of
                the corridor is a single door with a SPY-HOLE. The loud
                music is coming from there. We can hear now that it is an
                annoying children's show song or heavy metal.
                We TRACK towards the door...
                Lyn hesitates then slides back the SPY-HOLE cover and
                peers in.

                LYN'S P.O.V -
                An IRAQI PRISONER sits huddled in the cell, illuminated
                in the flashes of a powerful STROBE LIGHT OVERHEAD.

                The prisoner looks terrified, and despite the whimsical
                music the whole scene is horribly sinister.
                Lyn steps away from the spy-hole.

                             I think you should go and see Lyn,
                             sir. (Beat) he needs you.
                Bill doesn't answer.

          

          

          

                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             The man crossed a desert to see
                             you again.
                Bill takes a long drink, stares at the sky. Bob watches
                him with mounting frustration.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             You know, he told me all these
                             stories about Bill Django, and I
                             was pretty excited to meet you,
                             but I've gotta tell you...you're
                             one big disappointment.
                Bill doesn't react. Bob starts to walk away then turns
                back, and throws the FEATHER down at Bill's feet.

                                           BOB (CONT'D)
                             He told me to give you that back.
                             I don't know why. Its supposed to
                             be a mark of honour isn't it? I
                             don't see how you deserve that.
                Beat. Bill turns to look at Bob for the first time. He
                takes a long drink.

                                              BILL DJANGO

                             The feather. Twenty thousand
                             dollar fine for taking an eagle
                             feather. This one's off a turkey.
                             You just die the tip black. (Beat)
                             Don't tell Lyn.
                Bill stares at the feather.

                             None of it was real.

                             That isn't true. That isn't true.
                He looks around for inspiration - notices a LONE CLOUD
                floating in the sky.
                Bob places his fingers on his temples and STARES at the
                cloud, focuses, desperate, hopeful...
                Bill notices and watches, curious.
                Slowly, the cloud fades and DISAPPEARS.

                                                                   (CONTINUED)

                Bob can't believe it. He looks at Bill who is staring at
                him. He has tears in his eyes.

                Lyn lies sleeping. Larry sits at the foot of his bed,
                smoking a cigar. He watches Lyn for a moment, then COUGHS
                deliberately. Nothing. He repeats the cough - louder. Lyn
                wakes.

                                        LARRY HOOPER
                          Oh. Didn't mean to wake you.
                The two men stare at each other.

                          Scotty Mercer told you, didn't he?

                          No.

                          Yeah, he did. We told Scotty we
                          were coming over here, asked him
                          if he wanted some work.

                                        LYN CASSADY
                          I haven't seen Scotty.

                          That's funny, because he told me
                          he'd run into you and mentioned
                          that there might be some jobs
                          going with us over here. (Beat)

                          Lyn? You want back in, don't you?
                Lyn stares at him, disturbed, afraid this might be true.

                They walk on and reach the doors to the KITCHENS. The two
                men hesitate, look at each other...
                Then Bob walks in.

                PSIC WORKERS AND PSYOPS TROOPS are all eating breakfast
                together, talking, laughing.
                Bob and Bill sit drinking coffee. Lyn appears with a tray
                and sits down beside Bob.

                They eat in silence for a moment. Lyn turns to look out
                of the window to where Larry Hooper stands outside in the
                early morning sun, smoking a cigar and drinking coffee.
                He turns and notices Lyn, raises his cup, smiles. Lyn
                looks troubled. Bob suddenly leans into Lyn.

                                           BOB

                Lyn turns to Bob puzzled.

                             Don't eat the jello.
                Lyn tries to puzzle this out but is distracted by Larry
                outside who seems to have noticed something in the sand
                at his feet - a small insect of some kind. He begins to
                watch it with strange fascination. After a moment he
                sinks to his knees in order to get a better look at it.
                One of the SOLDIERS notices and starts to laugh softly.
                His neighbor looks at him as if he's crazy then begins to
                laugh himself. Lyn looks around him, sensing the strange
                atmosphere creeping through the room.

                             We put LSD in the jello.
                Lyn turns to stare at him.

                             What?

                                           BOB
                             Bill showed me where Larry had
                             bottles of LSD. So we put it in
                             the jello mix last night.

                Bob turns to stare at him.

                             What?

                             I put it in the main water tank as
                             well.

                Bob stares at him, aghast.

                          But...we've drunk the water.

                          to be HOT!
                Through the window we see Larry get on his belly to get a
                better look at the bug.

          

          167   INT. RADIO STATION - MORNING                               167

                The DJ SOLDIER has gone off script. A PRODUCER is trying
                ineffectually to pull him away from the desk.

                                         ARMY BROADCASTER

                          I'm guessing. I mean, I haven't
                          looked at the, the thing but I'd
                          say it's going to be fucking HOT!
                          Hot. Hot. Hot.
                The Producer pulls and releases the DJ's headphones so
                they slap against his head and starts giggling.

                CLOSE on a LOUDSPEAKER - blasting a period song out over
                the base. We BOOM down to where two SOLDIERS are dancing,
                tripping.

                ALL OVER THE BASE
                Soldiers are wandering around, talking, some falling to
                their knees, weak with laughter. Some stand alone,
                staring with a beatific smile at the sky.

          

          

                                                                    (CONTINUED)

                As the music plays on a STRYKER ARMORED VEHICLE drives
                around the corner of a building, a SOLDIER standing up,
                arms raised, in the gun turret.
                The Stryker screeches into a clumsy skid, the Soldier
                having to hang on. The Stryker roars off again, heading
                straight for the GATES of the base.

                                           SOLDIER
                                  (calling down into

                             You're going to hit the gates.
                             You're going to hit the gates.
                The Stryker veers left and smashes through the perimeter
                fence and out into the desert.

                The DJ and the Producer are wrestling over the sound
                desk, laughing.

          

          170   INT. BASE - CORRIDOR                                     170

                Bob and Bill walk towards the cell block.

                                           BOB

                                  (ANGRY)
                             Don't you think it might have been
                             more sensible if we hadn't drunk
                             the fucking water?

                                           BILL DJANGO
                             That might have aroused suspicion.
                             But don't worry. Over the years I
                             have built up a massive tolerance
                             to all narcotics.

          

          171   INT. CELL - MORNING                                      171

                An IRAQI PRISONER looks up startled as the door to the
                cell is flung open and Bill stands, filling the doorway,
                bare-chested, wild-eyed and wild-haired.

                Lyn slides open the door to the shed and begins to shoo
                the goats out into the light.

          

          173   EXT. BASE - LATER                                        173

                As the music continues Bob, Lyn and Bill appear leading a
                column of nervous IRAQI PRISONERS out of the building,
                towards the gates. Lyn and Bill are holding BABY GOATS in
                their ARMS. A tripping Bob is holding bunches of flowers -
                it's as close as they can get to the illustration from
                the New Earth Army Manual. Lyn holds up a hand to stop
                the procession.
                Larry stands in front of them, a GUN in his hand, his
                face blank.
                Lyn and Larry stare at each other. Then, unexpectedly,
                Larry starts to cry.

                                        LYN CASSADY

                          Give me the gun Larry.
                Larry starts to raise the gun to his mouth. Pauses.
                Scratches his head.

                                        LARRY HOOPER
                          Wow. I'm hungry.
                He wanders off.

                Over the loud-speakers we hear the opening of a period
                song.

                beckoning the prisoners through, hugging the prisoners as
                they pass through.

                One by one the Iraqis walk out through the broken fence,
                staring around them suspiciously, expecting a trap.
                Nothing happens, no one shoots them.

                             Ma'assalama.
                The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand.
                Beyond them we can the Stryker, driving in circles in the
                desert, a NAKED SOLDIER stands whooping on top.

          

          175   EXT. BASE - LATER                                        175

                Bob, tripping heavily, is staring with fascination at the
                sand trickling through his fingers. Suddenly we hear the
                building whine of the HELICOPTER engine starting up. Bob
                looks up, puzzled.

                Bill and Lyn sit in the chopper, Bill at the controls.
                Lyn is holding the flowers.
                Bob appears, hurrying over.

                                           BOB

                             going...what about the mission?

                             the mission! Tell them what
                             happened!
                The helicopter begins to rise. Bob stands swaying,
                staring up. Lyn smiles sadly through the window, raises
                his hand.
                The Helicopter RISES - HIGHER AND HIGHER. Bob waves
                goodbye.

                             At the time I was hurt that Lyn
                             hadn't taken me with him. But now
                             I know it was because he and Bill
                             had already seen what was to come.

                As the helicopter flies off into the blue.

                          Nobody knows exactly what
                          happened. The official
                          story is that their helicopter
                          must have crashed, either because
                          they were hit by an RPG or
                          because...well, that's what
                          happens when you fly a helicopter
                          while you're tripping on acid. All
                          I know is they've never been seen
                          since. Like all Shaman they
                          returned to the sky.
                The helicopter disappears altogether.

                                                                DISSOLVE TO:

                          story up. Everything.

                Bob sits in his car staring at his old home, across the
                road. Through the window we can see Bob's ex-wife Debora,
                eating dinner with Bob's ex-Editor - Dave.

                          I sent it to the newspapers, the
                          radio stations, the TV stations,
                          because that was what Lyn wanted
                          me to do. The people needed to
                          know.

                Bob sits watching a Today style show on TV.

          

                                        BOB (V.O.)
                          I was ready for whatever they
                          would do to me. I was ready to
                          disappear. I was ready to go to
                          prison. I was a Jedi and I was
                          fighting for the New Earth Army.

                             prison. They did something much
                             worse.

                             cruel and unusual tool to break
                             the resistance of Iraqi POWs, and
                             many parents would agree! Some

                Bob is working for another small town newspaper. He sits
                at his desk, staring fixedly ahead at the wall.

          

                                           BOB (V.O.)
                             That was it. That was the only bit
                             of my story that ran anywhere. And
                             it was a joke. And if I ever
                             needed proof of how the Dark Side
                             have taken the beautiful dream of
                             what a nation could be and had
                             twisted it, destroyed it, that was
                             it.

          
                Bob stands up. He starts to walk down the office, his
                face set with grim determination.

                             But I won't stop. I won't give up.
                Bob quickens his pace.

                             Because when I look at what is
                             happening in the world, I know
                             that now, more than ever, we need
                             to become ALL that we can BE.
                Bob is running.

                                                     CLOSE ON:
          
          The face of MINERVA "MINI" DROGUES, 18, watching something.
          She looks extremely bored by the television images flickering
          across her eyes. She has a pretty face: Large eyes, and pouty
          mouth. Her knowing look is incongruous with a face clearly
          still that of a girl.
          
          -                    MINI (V.O.)
                    I know what you're thinking. Don't
                    bullshit me, because I do... You're
          -         thinking, oh dear lord in heaven,
                    please, I'm begging you. I'll gouge
          -         out my eyes with the straw in my
                    drink right now. I'll jam every
                    last kernel of popcorn into my
          -         mouth until I suffocate, just not
                    another fucking teenage coming-of-
                    age story.
          
          We pull back to reveal her body, which is moving out of that
          awkward stage between adolescence and womanhood. Though tall
          and thin, her hips haven't quite rounded. She's wearing a
          "FUCT" T-shirt and jean shorts.

                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Well, relax...no prom night
                    highjinks, no nerds becoming
                    popular and no Shakespeare set in
                    high school...I promise.

          CLOSE ON: THE TV SCREEN. "When Animals Attack" is on. In a
          series of quick cuts:
          
           A zoo keeper is mauled by an elephant.
          
           A sport fisherman is attacked on the deck of a boat by a
          shark he and his buddies thought was dead.

           A pit bull clamps down on his owner's arm.
          
           An alligator hunter stupidly puts his head in the mouth of a
          just-captured alligator, only to have it chomp down on his
          skull.
          
                               MINI (V.O.)
                    Since it happened, everyone's
                    asked me how it all started.
          
                                                                     2.
          
          
          
          Mini's face registers no reaction to the gruesome images. We
          now see she is sitting in the living room of a well-appointed
          Studio City hillside home.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM- EVENING- A PARTY.
          
          TEENAGERS OF PRIVILEGE and their UPTIGHT PARENTS are milling
          around, dancing and chatting as A DEEJAY spins tunes.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    I suppose the obvious answer is my
                    eighteenth birthday...
          
          Mini dances with a few friends in a very short mini-skirt and
          halter top. She clearly understands how to the drive the boys
          crazy and this is not lost on her mother, DIANE, 42, who
          stands off to the side, nursing a drink with some other HYPER-
          AEROBICIZED MOTHERS.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    See, I was blessed with a terrific
                    mom. Not only is she a lush, but
                    she also hates me.
          
          Diane is beautiful, but there is an essential hardness to her
          that comes from a life spent trading on her looks. The
          blouse and mini-skirt she wears are inappropriately revealing
          for the occasion of her daughter's birthday.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    A few days before the party, I
                    overhear her on the phone ordering
                    me a male stripper. Nothing says "I
                    love you" like ten inches of man
                    meat in your face.
          
          Diane and the other mothers are talking about Mini's dancing.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And knowing dear old ma, she'll try
                    and nail him after the party...in
                    my bed.
          
          Mini's friend KAYLA, a little rounder, but also brash, comes
          dancing over. She's swaying her hips provocatively at Mini,
          almost challenging her.
          
          MIKE RUDELL, a tanned and trim man of 55, watches their
          display, clearly enjoying the way it's jump-starting his
          imagination.

                       big shot TV producer and the guy my
                       mom screws whenever the batteries
                       run out.
          
          Kayla and Mini begin dancing together in a very explicit way,
          clearly trying to make the adults uncomfortable.

                               MINI
                       Yo, bee-ach!

                       Oh, it's on!
          
                                 MINI
                       That's my girl!
          
          Mini grabs Kayla and dips her low.
          
          INT. THE KITCHEN - LATER.
          
          Kayla instructs some CATERERS to start wheeling a giant
          birthday cake into the living room. The caterers look
          confused, but Kayla is insistent and the young men obey,
          starting to wheel the cake down the long hall.
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          The cake emerges from the hallway. The caterers begin singing
          "Happy Birthday", as Diane turns to see it and her eyes flash
          rage. As Diane comes storming over, we switch to SLOW MOTION.
          
                                  MINI (V.O.)
                       See, to understand me, you need to
                       understand that life, in my
                       opinion, is all about new
                       experiences. "Firsts" is what I
                       call them.
          
          As she strides across the room, the look of vitriolic rage on
          Diane's face grows stronger with every step.

                       Somewhere around fourteen, when I
                       had my first...rhymes with duck, I
                       realized that the goal of life, any
                       life, should be to cram as many
                       "firsts" into it as possible.
          
          We switch back to real time.

          we see A NUDE MINI rises out of it like Venus on the half

                                                     MINI'S POV:
          
          A collection of reactions from the party goers: The mothers
          are numb, the fathers pretend to be disturbed, while copping
          looks, and her friends are in stitches. Some are even waving
          dollar bills.        M

                       That was definitely a first, but
                       more importantly, it was the first
                       time I really understood my
                       potential...And that's when it all
                       started.

                       Oh, Mom, this is the best birthday
                       ever!
          
                                                                   5.
          
          
          
          INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini stands in a bathrobe with a towel around her head,
          having just taken a shower. She removes the towel to reveal
          she's just changed her hair color to FLAMING RED.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    That little stunt got me grounded
                    for a week, but it was worth it.
          
                                                   CUT TO:

                    See, I just don't understand people
                    who live their lives as one big
                    routine.
          
                                                   CUT TO:

                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    They're basically saying "I'm not
                    worthy of a unique experience on
                    this earth."...Well, sorry, but I
                    am.

                    The law of firsts has served me
                    well, because it's liberated me
                    from the usual pathetic, repetitive
                    concerns of high school.

                    I simply don't care if I'm popular,
                    because if I did, then I'd be
                    constantly stressing about whether
                    my clothes are cool enough, or if
                    Troy, the "gay but he doesn't know
                    it yet" quarterback, is gonna call.
          
                                                                      6.
          
          
          
          INT. THE HALLWAY OF MINI'S HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
          
          Mini and Kayla walk down the crowded halls attracting lustful
          looks from some of the more aggressive boys.
          
          They approach a group of FOOTBALL PLAYERS.
          
                              KAYLA
                        (whispering, worried)
                    Oh, God, it's Troy.
          
                              MINI
                    Just keep walking and don't look at
                    him.
          T
           ROY, a cocky, chiseled, all-around nightmare, sticks his
          tongue in his cheek, simulating a blow job.
          
                              TROY
                    Yo, Kayla, I got some more of what
                    you were looking for Saturday
                    night.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Ahh...The joys of the American
                    educational system.
          
          Kayla puts her head down, her face turning red, as Mini stops
          to address Troy and his posse.
          
                              MINI (CONT'D)
                        (suddenly brightening)
                    Actually, Troy, I think you
                    confused her with that senile,
                    toothless grandmother of yours.
          
          "Ooohs" and "Aaahs" erupt from the onlookers as Troy looks
          concerned his ambush has backfired.
          
                              TROY
                    Yo, Mini, why don't you use that
                    mouth for something useful and suck
                    my dick?
          
          More students start to gather, overhearing them.
          
                              MINI
                    Actually, now that you mention it,
                    I can't think of anything I'd
                    rather do than suck your dick.

          Troy looks around, surprised and emboldened by her
          declaration.
          
                                 TROY
                       Well, it's all for you, babe.
          
          Mini moves closer, looking him right in the eye.
          
                                 MINI
                       Really?
          
                                 TROY
                           (daring her)
                       If you can fit it all in.
          
          The crowd has now swelled to a few dozen, as everyone is
          riveted by the exchange. Suddenly, Mini starts unzipping his
          fly.
          
                                 TROY (CONT'D)
                       Hey, what the?!

                           (grabbing his belt buckle)
                       I'm going to suck your dick, Troy,
                       you said I could.
          
          Troy tries to push her away, but she's got a grip on his
          belt. Everyone watching is almost speechless at first, but
          then giggles start to erupt.
          
                                 TROY
                       Yo, this ain't funny!
          
                                  MINI
                       No, Troy, I want to suck your dick
                       right now!
          
                                 TROY

                       come on!
          
          She gets down on her knees, struggling to get a hand in his
          pants. The crowd howls with approval, as they almost can't
          believe their eyes.

          Troy finally pushes her off, humiliated, and runs down the
          hall as the mob laughs at him. Kayla looks at her gratefully
          and smiles.

                    When she gets really sauced, she'll
                    pop the tapes in and make me watch,
                    then I'll threaten to call the
                    suicide hotline.
          
          She continues through the living room towards the door,
          hiking her mini skirt up a little.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    After a few years, she got
                    desperate and spread 'em for this
                    fat, ugly producer when he promised
                    to give her a role in some bullshit
                    cable series that was basically
                    softcore porn. She got knocked up
                    with me and he told her she
                    couldn't be on the show, unless she
                    hoovered me out.
          
          She reaches the front the door.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Excuse me for one sec.
          
          She opens the door to reveal a delivery boy, JIMMY 20's, with
          six cases of liquor stacked on a handcart.
          
                              JIMMY
                        (nervously excited)
                    Hey, Mini, how you doin'?
          
                              MINI
                    You're late.
          
                                                                     11.

          Mini watches as Jimmy carefully lifts one case after another
          on to the counter.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    She was gonna do it, too, at least
                    that what's she told me when she
                    was feeling particularly loving.
                    But then she heard rumors the show
                    wasn't gonna fly and realized
                    eighteen years of child support
                    beat thirteen weeks on "Skin
                    Tight", so I got to stick around.
                    ...Bad choice.
          
          Mini opens one case, takes out a bottle and heads out of the
          kitchen.

                    Anyway, what Mom didn't count on
                    was the prick having a heart attack
                    and croaking a year after I was
                    born.
          
          She pours it into a martini glass and drops an olive in.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    When she tried to collect on his
                    estate, she found out he'd owed the
                    government two point five in back
                    taxes.

                       Now, if she had been smart, she
                       would've set her sights a little
                       lower and gone after a guy who
                       would've worshipped the ground she
                       walked on and wouldn't care that
                       she already had a kid...

          Diane getting into the car. She turns to the driver and gives

                       gobbling every knob from Hollywood
                       to the Palisades.
          
          As the car pulls away, we see an 8 YEAR OLD MINI watch from
          an upstairs window of the building.

          Mini sits watching TV as Diane walks in with YET ANOTHER
          SLEAZY GUY, his hands all over her. Diane looks surprised
          and pissed to see Mini still up.

                       bed?
          
          Mini just stares at her, then shifts her penetrating gaze to
          SLEAZY GUY #3. He looks unnerved by Mini.
          
          SLEAZY GUY #3

          Mini lies awake as the SOUNDS OF DIANE FUCKING SLEAZY GUY
          #3's brains out waft through the thin walls.
          
                                                                    13.

          Mini sits at the kitchen table eating cereal as THE FOURTH
          SLEAZY GUY emerges from Diane's bedroom, he's tucking his
          shirt in. He looks a little startled to see her up.
          
          SLEAZY GUY #4
          
          Oh...Uh, hi, uh, tell your mom I, uh, had a good time.
          
                              MINI
                    Oh, I will...Like some coffee for
                    the road?
          
          The guy looks at her a little surprised, then smiles.

          Sure...thanks, kid.

          SLEAZY GUY #4 driving down the freeway, drinking coffee from
          a paper cup. Suddenly, a look of absolute dread overcomes
          him.
          
          INT. DIANE'S APARTMENT - LATER.
          
          Diane emerges from her bedroom in her bathrobe, looking
          disheveled. She glares at Mini, who sits at the kitchen
          table eating her cereal.
          
                              DIANE
                    Do you want to live in this shit
                    hole your whole life?
          
          Mini just stares at her.
          
                              DIANE
                    Then stay in your fucking room
                    until they leave. Got it?
          
          Mini says nothing. Suddenly, Diane picks up a SMALL PIECE OF
          POTTERY from the coffee table and throws it at Mini's head.
          Mini ducks as it SMASHES behind her on the wall.

          Mini, Diane and MARTIN TANNEN, 45, a trim executive in an
          Armani suit and $300 haircut, mingle at a large corporate
          cocktail party. Martin, a man who understands, in his world,

                    an image of stability for his

          LATER. Martin finishes talking to a client and heads out on
          the balcony to get some air, where he sees Diane kissing a
          HANDSOME YOUNG EXECUTIVE off to the side. Martin stiffens as
          he watches in SLOW MOTION her tongue slip into his mouth.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Then he figured out what he had
                    married...by then it was too late.

                    First time in three months he's

                    and right now I'm thinking his pin
                    cushion must have given him the
                    walking papers or...found a new

                    He's a partner at a public
                    relations firm, which is ironic
                    because I can't remember the last
                    time he and my mom were seen in
                    public together...or had relations.

          Martin punches a few buttons on the organizer, his mind
          clearly elsewhere.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Mmm...Is your homework done?
          
                                 MINI
                       Haven't even cracked a book.
          
                                 MARTIN
                           (not listening)
                       Mmm...
          
          INT. MINI'S BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini double checks her purse for everything: lipstick,
          compact, Altoids, a flask of liquor and a string of condoms.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Considering how many guys my mom
                       has done in his bed, you've got to
                       admire his resolve. He could've
                       left her years ago, but with no pre-
                       nup, he loses half and he just
                       won't give in.
          
                                                                  17.
          
          
          
          EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini walks out the front door, revealing an impressive front
          of the house with stone pillars and a brick circular drive.
          Martin's MERCEDES 500 SL COUPE and Mini's BMW Z3 convertible
          sit in the open garage.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Their arrangement actually keeps
                    everything very calm.
          
          Mini gets into her BMW.
          
          EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - NIGHT
          
          The BMW drives down the street, weaving in and out of
          traffic.             M
                               MINI (V.O.)
                    As I said, the rule of firsts
                    guides my life. Once you've gotten
                    into every club in town and had
                    enough Ivy League lawyers cum too
                    fast, drastic measures are called
                    for.
          
          EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks past the neon covered shop windows.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    I thought it would be a goof if I
                    put a photo ad in one of those 25
                    cent "outcall" massage newspapers
                    they sell around town. But I just
                    got a bunch of pervs breathing
                    heavy on my voice mail. So I went
                    to an escort service, and when they
                    found out I was 18, they told me
                    they had two tricks in the same
                    hotel that night...if I was up to
                    it.
          
          She passes OLDER PROSTITUTES soliciting cars that have slowed
          down for a peek.
          
                              MINI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Would you look at them?
          
          One of the prostitutes gives her a threatening look.

                       It's pathetic. I mean, she's got to
                       be, what? At least twenty
                       eight?...In dog years.
                           (pausing)
                       Oh, wait, that would make her four.
          
          She arrives in front of the HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL.
          
          INT. A HALLWAY OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks down a hall and stops in front of a room and
          knocks. She looks around trepidatiously, as she waits for an
          answer. The door opens and a MIDDLE AGED MAN opens the door.
          He's very well groomed in a creepy middle american way. He
          could be a serial killer or...
          
          INT. A HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
          
          Mini pulls her red top on and heads for the door, as the man
          sheepishly follows her.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My first night as a call girl was
                       a serious let down. It turns out
                       both guys were in town for the
                       "Promise Keepers" convention.
          
          She reaches the door. He opens it and points to the room
          across from his. Mini walks across and knocks.
                               M
                                  MINI (V.O.)
                       The first one got so excited I
                       didn't even get a chance to get my
                       panties off before he creamed
                       himself.
          
          A HEAVIER MAN in a denim shirt opens it.
          
          INT. THE OTHER HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
          
          The heavier man is on his knees, weeping as he hugs Mini
          around the waist.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       And the other said I looked so much
                       like his niece, he started
                       whimpering and praying for
                       forgiveness.
          
          She rolls her eyes in frustration.
          
                                                                   19.
          
          
          
          EXT. FOUNTAIN AVENUE - NIGHT
          
          Mini drives home, suddenly a SIREN is heard and she sees the
          FLASHING LIGHTS of a cop car behind her. Mini pulls over
          looking pissed.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Time to bat the eye lashes...
          
          The cop car pulls up behind her and a FEMALE COP WITH A BUZZ
          CUT gets out, approaching the car. Mini looks in her mirror,
          with a sly smile. The cop reaches Mini's door and looks down
          at her, clearly attracted to her.
          
          EXT. A BACK ALLEY OFF FOUNTAIN - NIGHT
          
          THE POLICE CRUISER is parked with its lights off.
          
          INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          THE FEMALE COP is lying on the seat with her legs spread, as
          Mini goes down on her. The woman is clutching the steering
          wheel with her left hand and the seat with her right, hanging
          on for dear life as Mini rocks her world.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    This? Are you kidding? My first
                    woman and my first cop?...It
                    would've been perfect if she hadn't
                    wanted to cuddle afterwards.
          
          INT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.
          
          Mini unlocks the door and walks in to find Diane passed out,
          face-up on the sofa in a loosely-tied bathrobe. At the sound
          of the door, Diane looks up.
          
                              DIANE
                        (slurring)
                    Oh...wha- what are you doing here?
          M
           ini stops and looks at her mother, absorbing her insightful
          question. Mini sighs and heads for the bedroom.
          
                              DIANE
                    Did you have fun, dear?
          
                              MINI
                    Yeah, I turned two tricks and went
                    down on a dyke cop.

          Mini heads down the hallway.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       God, what's gotten into her? She
                       was almost warm and fuzzy.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini walks in and stops dead in her tracks. A GREASY-HAIRED
          NAKED MAN lies passed out on her bed. His body hair is thick
          and matted. His genitals are covered by her pillow, which he
          cradles like a teddy bear.
          
          Mini's jaw tightens slowly.
          
          INT. THE LOBBY OF THE PENINSULA HOTEL - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks through the lobby past TWO BUSINESSMEN sitting at
          the bar, chatting up TWO VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMEN in their mid
          twenties.
          
                                  MINI (V.O.)
                       After that night, things really
                       picked up.
          
          The men's eyes instinctively follow Mini, as their dates
          exchange a glance of annoyance.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My one rule which the agency wasn't
                       too happy about was, of course,
                       only firsts, no repeat customers.
          
          EXT. AN OFFICE BUILDING IN SHERMAN OAKS - DAY
          
          This time Mini walks in, dressed like a normal high school
          student, past a SECURITY GUARD.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       But believe me, they didn't have
                       too much trouble honoring that
                       request.
          
          INT. AN IMPRESSIVE CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini is led in by a SECRETARY who presents Mini to one of the
          PENINSULA BUSINESSMEN sitting behind a large oak desk.

                       I'd make house calls to offices at
                       lunch hour and we'd say I was
                       someone's niece or cousin in town
                       on vacation.

                       last minute gig at a fuck pad in
                       Westwood that some executive keeps
                       so "wifey" doesn't find the motel
                       bills on the gold card statements.

                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       They tell me he's not big on the
                       chit-chat and he loves paying extra
                       for the stuff we charge extra for.

          The executive "convenience" apartment is cold, sterile and
          clearly just used for short amounts of time. Mini opens the
          door, passing the closet, the bathroom door and then stops
          suddenly as she sees...
          
          MARTIN, her stepfather, sitting up in bed.
          
          She quickly turns away before he sees her face.

          Mini goes back towards the front door, panicking. She
          absently hangs her jacket up in the closet, to buy some time.

                       Mind if I freshen up?
          
                                    MARTIN
                       Sure.
          
          Mini ducks into the bathroom.
          
          INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini shuts the door, turns on the light and looks at herself
          in the mirror. She's almost white from the shock. She looks
          down at the counter.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My own dad! My first thought was
                       "how sick is he?" But then I
                       started thinking...I'm one to talk,
                       and...well...

          Mini's expression softens as she examines herself closer.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Why not? I mean, he isn't my real
                       dad...and talk about a first. The
                       more I thought about it...
          
          A wicked glint dances across her eyes.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       ...the more turned on I got. Then I
                       thought that if my mother could do
                       some strange guy in my bed, I could
                       do her strange guy in this bed.
          
                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                       Everything alright in there?
          
                                 MINI
                           (still in her southern
                            accent)
                       Just peachy. Listen, Sugar, would
                       you mind turning the lights off,
                       I'm kinda new to all this and a
                       little shy.
          
                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                       No, that's fine, but can we get
                       this show on the road?
          
                                 MINI
                       Sure can, in two shakes of a lamb's
                       tail.
          
          INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martin turns the light off next to the bed. A little bit of
          light from the street sneaks in around the edges of the
          blinds. After a second, the door opens and Mini comes out in
          a bra and panties.
          
          Mini crosses the room slowly and sits on the edge of the bed,
          letting her hair fall over her face. Martin tries to pull her
          hair away from her eyes, but she turns away, playfully
          shaking her head "no".
          
          She reaches down and touches him through the sheet. He looks
          up at her, clearly excited, but she keeps her gaze down. He
          reaches over to the nightstand and picks up his wallet.

                       Oh, so you want complete access?

                       Y...yes.
          
                                 MINI
                       You do know that's extra?
          
          He nods.
          
                                  MINI
                       Just so we're clear...Now, close
                       your eyes.
          
          Martin furrows his brow, disappointed.
          
                                  MINI
                       Come on.
          
          He obeys.
          
                                 MINI
                       Now just keep them shut for a
                       while.
          
          Mini pulls the sheet back, revealing his body to her. She
          starts kissing his chest, inhaling deeply. She looks up at
          his expectant face, intoxicated with her power. Her mouth
          starts to move down his chest. Martin lets out a small,
          almost self-conscious gasp.
          
                                                       FADE OUT:
          
          INT. THE ROOM - LATER.
          
          It is still dark as Martin and Mini lie under the sheets,
          post coitus in the "spoons" position. Martin has a dreamy,
          satisfied look on his face. Mini smiles to herself.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       I can't believe I pulled that off.
                       Keeping my face hidden actually
                       wasn't that hard, and he pretty
                       much let me do whatever I wanted.

          INT. THE BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini is getting dressed.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And you know what?...He was damn
                    good. I don't why Mom is throwing
                    the cat all over town, when she can
                    have this every night.
          
          INT. THE BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          The room still dark, Mini emerges from the bathroom, dressed.

                    but...uh...I never got your name?
          
          Even in the dark, he looks a little embarrassed. Mini smiles.

          INT/EXT. UPPER LEVEL OF THE BUILDING'S PARKING GARAGE-
          
          LATER.
          
          Mini walks to her car, giddy with excitement.

                    I literally couldn't feel the
                    ground under my feet. A first to
                    top all firsts. I knew I'd tell him
                    one day, but I wanted to savor it
                    for a while.
          
          She reaches her car and looks for her keys in her purse. Her
          eyebrows furrow as she has trouble finding them. Suddenly,
          she realizes they aren't there. She freezes.

          Startled, her head whips around to see Martin walking towards
          her, carrying her jacket. He stops, the realization setting
          in.

          Seconds go by as Mini allows a pathologically triumphant
          smile to spread across her mouth.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Here's to immediate gratification.
          
          Martin starts to look nauseous, as Mini walks slowly over and
          gives him a deep, wet kiss right on the mouth.

                       You were great.
          
          Martin just stares straight ahead, numb. After another moment
          he walks to the railing of the garage, staring down at the
          street below.
          
          MARTIN'S POV: A few cars rush by on the street below. It
          appears to be about a three or four story drop.
          
          He looks back at Mini. He starts to lift a leg over the
          railing.
          
                                 MINI
                       Uh, that fall probably won't kill
                       you, and considering what a caring
                       nurturer your wife is, I don't
                       think that's a risk you can afford
                       to take.
          
          Martin looks down at the street for another moment.

                       God, what a drama queen. Don't let
                       this little act fool you. He'd
                       never let mom get all his money.

          Martin and Mini sit at a booth. Martin stirs his coffee
          looking shell shocked. Mini devours a plate of Belgian
          waffles covered with whipped cream.

                    We spent the next few hours just
                    sitting there. I don't think we
                    said three words. I think he was
                    trying to find a way to justify the
                    whole thing, but it was actually
                    one of the sweetest nights I ever
                    spent with a guy.

                    He told me it was a monumental
                    mistake and that we should both
                    never mention it again. I told him
                    that was fine.

                    Suddenly, he started coming home
                    every night and even started really
                    asking me about my homework.

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Martin watches television next to Diane, who's passed out
          with an empty bottle of vodka sitting on the coffee table. A
          BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION is open as well. Martin
          looks over at Diane, pokes her to make sure she's truly
          blitzed, checks his watch and stands up.

           NT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini lies in bed under the covers, reading. The door to her
          room opens. She looks at the clock. It reads: 12:15am. Martin
          enters.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       It took exactly one week.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          The lights are off, and the two of them are going at it under
          the covers.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       In the beginning, I was concerned
                       this would violate my rule as he
                       technically was a repeat customer,
                       but then I realized this was my
                       first affair, and with my
                       stepfather no less. To be perfectly
                       honest...I loved it. Talk about
                       electric, knowing at any moment she
                       could walk in was better than any
                       drug. It reminded me of when I was
                       young and brought guys home after
                       school.
          
                                                                    29.
          
          
          
          INT. MINI'S BATHROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini and Martin are locked in an embrace behind a steamed-
          over glass shower door.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    At first, we were very discreet,
                    only doing it when Joan Crawford
                    wasn't home or was completely
                    comatose.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini and Martin post coital, catching their breath, as they
          both stare at the ceiling. Martin looks over at her and they
          share a conspiratorial smile.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Then we got bolder, doing it before
                    she would pass out. I think we were
                    seeing exactly how far we could
                    push the envelope.
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          Mini and Martin poke their heads out from the hallway that
          leads to Mini's bedroom. Diane is watching TV with a martini
          glass in her hand.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    One night we did it before
                    "Entertainment Tonight" ended.
          
                                                     DISSOLVE TO:
          
          Them under the covers, but this time the lights in her room

                    We even almost got caught.
          
                              DIANE (O.S.)
                    Mini?
          
          Mini and Martin stop at the sound of her voice, they look at
          each other, realizing Diane's right outside.
          
                              MINI
                        (startled)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Suddenly, the door flies open, as Martin ducks under the
          covers. Diane stands there with a drink in her hand and what
          appears to be cocaine residue under her nostrils. She appears
          truly wired and incoherent, it's unclear whether she's even
          noticed someone else in the bed.
          
                                 MINI
                       God, I've told you a thousand times
                       to knock.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Have you seen Martin? I think he
                       was in his study a half hour ago.
          
                                 MINI
                       Uh...can't say that I have.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Well, I assume he's gone out, so
                       I've invited Ricardo over for
                       a...cocktail. You know how children
                       make him uneasy, so I'd appreciate
                       if you and...
                           (pointing to Martin under
                            the sheet)
                       ...your friend could either stay in
                       here or use the back door when he
                       arrives.
          
          For a moment, Mini can't believe her mother appears to have
          no problem with there being a man in her bed.
          
                                 MINI
                       Oh...sure, no problem.
          
          Diane shuts the door.
          
                                 MINI
                       Okay, she's gone.
          
          Martin pokes his head out of the covers. The two of them
          share a smile, not believing their luck. They start to laugh
          and then after a moment she kisses him deeply and they resume
          where they left off.

                       Looking back, that may have been
                       the moment we fell in love.
          
                                                                    31.

          Mini tries on a cocktail dress, as Martin looks on, giving
          his approval.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    We became inseparable.
          
          EXT. THE TANNEN'S POOL - DAY
          
          Mini sits at the pool side table, as Martin helps her with
          her homework.        M
                               MINI (V.O.)
                    Mom thought it was cute how we had
                    suddenly grown so close, and
                    thought it was wonderful how Martin
                    had taken an interest in my
                    education.
          
          From inside the house, Diane is seen lighting a cigarette,
          looking out at them and smiling.
          
          CLOSE ON HER HOMEWORK: Mini has drawn a dirty cartoon which
          indicates how well endowed he is. She jots down an arrow next
          to the words "actual size".
          
          Martin blushes, averting his eyes.
          
          EXT. THE OUTDOOR PATIO AT IL CIELO RESTAURANT - NIGHT
          
          The two of them sit at a romantic table in the candlelight,
          as A WAITER refreshes their wine.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Now that we were spending time
                    together, I actually started to
                    find out what Martin was like for
                    the first time.
          
          Martin tells her something and they both crack up.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    He wasn't the drip I thought he
                    was.
          
          EXT. VENICE BEACH - SUNSET
          
          The two walk hand in hand, stopping to watch the drum rhythm
          circle filled with LOCAL PERCUSSIONISTS and ON LOOKERS moving
          to the throbbing beat.

                       He was funny, charming, sweet and
                       even a little shy.
          
          Mini jumps into the circle, dancing along with the other
          revelers. Martin is content to watch, until she runs to the
          edge of the circle and pulls him in. Reluctantly, he begins
          to move with her and slowly start to enjoy himself.
          
          EXT. OCEAN AVENUE- SANTA MONICA- EARLY EVENING.
          
          Mini and Martin walk close together, but not the way couples
          do.

                       Being seen in public was no sweat,
                       as long as we didn't act like a
                       couple.
          
          EXT. MULHOLLAND DRIVE - NIGHT
          
          Martin's Mercedes snakes through an "s" curve, as the lights
                               M
          of the city twinkle in the background.

                       This went on for two months, before
                       we had the talk we both knew was
                       coming.
          
          The car pulls off the road at one of the tourist overlook
          areas with a view of the city.

                       someplace where they could give her
                       the care she needs.
          
          Martin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right.
          Her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes
          she's serious. He can't help but let the hint of a grin cross
          his lips.            M

                       As painful as it would be for me to
                       be without my loving wife.

          The sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving
          closer to her lips.

                       Of course, we'll have to make sure
                       her episodes are well documented.

          Unable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to
          hungrily tear at each other's clothes.

          Diane storms through the living room in the background,

          furiously fucking JEANETTE LANG, a similarly hyper-
          aerobicized wife, on his massage table.
          
          He's bent her over the table and is taking her from behind

          FIVE DELIVERY VANS from Rosa Angelica are parked outside as
          FIVE DELIVERY BOYS unload their cargo. It appears that they
          have brought the entire inventory of Rosa Angelica. DOZENS OF

          nurses coat.

          She takes a long slug.
          
          INT. THE NURSE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini quickly picks the flimsy lock on the medicine cabinet
          with a paper clip. She quickly looks through the bottles.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Which leaves me free to help myself
                       to the candy store.
          
          Mini finds what she needs and holds it up to read the label.
          
          CLOSE ON: THE LABEL indicating "RITALIN" and the dosage.
          
          Mini quickly closes the cabinet, walks out and stuffs the
          bottle in her pocket, just before Hauptführer enters.

                       Thank god for the quack who
                       invented ADD and the lazy parents
                       willing to let "Der Führer" keep
                       their kids comfortably numb on what
                       basically amounts to legalized

          INT. THE TANNEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
          
          Mini stands at the counter, making her mom A MARGARITA. She's
          cutting up all kinds of tropical fruits and putting them into
          a blender.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       My fears of mom giving up the sauce
                       were unfounded. Actually, she
                       started drinking more.
          
          She then takes a few tablets of Ritalin and grinds them up
          with their coffee grinder. She pours that into the blender
          and puts the lid on.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)

                       opportunity to prescribe her a
                       little pick-me-up.
          
          She turns on the blender.

          Diane's getting dressed for a party, trying to gracefully
          camouflage her cast with jewelry.

          The party is chock full of TROPHY WIVES and their decidedly
          less attractive HUSBANDS. Diane is in a full blown booze and
          Ritalin induced monologue, having cornered TWO WOMEN.

                       Phase three: rambling incoherent
                       monologues in public.

                       I feel fantastic, just fabulous. I
                       mean, I feel like I could run a
                       marathon like that Bruce Jenner
                       guy. He did that, right? Boy, I'll
                       tell you before he had that face
                       lift that made him look like a drag

          Suddenly, her ears unconsciously pick up the strands of a
          conversation going on behind them between TWO HUSBANDS.

                       I'd like to be on a jury and say

                       you think goes on in all the
                       sequestered situations? Do you
                       think any of the jurors have sex
                       with each other? I was once on an
                       episode of Love Boat, playing the
                       role of "Bikini Girl" and my line
                       was "I'll have another," it was
                       with "Isaac" at the pool bar. I had
                       to suck one of the associate
                       producers off to get the line, but
                       it got me my SAG card, so I guess
                       it was worth it.

          The security guard puts the phone to his ear. The BEEPING
          sound of a hang up is heard. He nods to his partner, as he
          removes a walkie talkie.

                       code 7, get an EMS unit over here.
          
          The two guards grab her. She drops the phone and starts
          scratching at one guard's face. The other pepper sprays her,
          as she falls down, howling.

          body. Diane kicks and punches at the guards.

                       I'm sure she would have qualified
                       as "committable". But that wasn't
                       enough, I wanted her to beg the

          Diane is almost asleep when the phone next to the bed RINGS,
          waking her up. She stares at it for a moment, trying to
          decide if she should answer it. On the forth ring, she

          second later it RINGS again. She waits two rings and then
          answers. Again a DIAL TONE.
          
          Now a bit freaked, Diane is fully awake and staring at the
          phone, waiting... PLINK! Something small hits the window
          across the room. Startled, she turns her head towards it.
          
          DIANE'S POV: Through the window, in the distance by the
          hedges a BLACK CLAD FIGURE is visible, wearing a ski mask and
          goggles. In the figure's right hand there is a gleaming,
          sharp kitchen knife.
          
          She can't believe her eyes.
          
          HER POV: The figure stands silently, bringing the knife up,
          indicating that he's going to cut her throat.

          She hangs up the phone and looks back at the hallway, but as
          she does, she sees reflected in a wall mirror: ANOTHER BLACK
          CLAD FIGURE outside the living room window, but this one
          holds a HAND AXE.
          
          She turns around to look out the window. THE FIGURE raises
          the axe slowly.
          
                                 DIANE
                       No...no...help! Help!
          
          She heads towards the front door to scream for help, but the
          axe wielding figure moves swiftly towards the door, making it
          unsafe for her to even try. Her face dissolves into utter
          despair, as she stumbles out of the room.
          
          INT. THE FAMILY DEN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane runs in to check that the sliding doors are locked. She
          clicks the lock shut, just as THE FIRST FIGURE with the knife
          appears in the door frame.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Oh, God! Help! Someone!
          
          Diane is transfixed by her own eyes reflected in the lenses
          of the goggles.
          
                                 DIANE
                           (softly )
                       No, please, no.
          
          She slowly backs away from the door, as the figure tries to
          open it. The door frame rattles on its track, as the figure
                               D
          violently tugs at the handle.
          
                                  IANE
                       Help! Someone please, help me!
          
          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          She runs back in, checking THE WINDOW. It's clear. She
          decides to check the front door. She runs over and looks out
          the peep hole.
          
          PEEP HOLE POV: It appears clear.
          
          She starts to undo the lock and then slowly peeks through the
          slit in the door, leaving the chain on.
          
          THROUGH THE SLIT: everything looks good.

          CONTINUED:
          
          She opens the door and looks towards the front gate, which is
          open. She looks as if she's thinking of making a dash for the
          gates. Just then, from behind the gate, steps the AXE
          WIELDING FIGURE.
          
          It shakes a finger "no" at her, as it walks towards the
          house. Terrified, she slams the door, locking it behind her.
          She instinctively pushes her back against the door, hyper-
          ventilating. She looks up at the ceiling, her eyes filling
          with tears.
          
                                 DIANE
                       Please God, please God...please!
          
          She looks around the room, searching for options. Suddenly,
          her eyes bulge as she sees THE KNIFE WIELDING FIGURE standing
          not ten feet away in the door to the kitchen.
          
          Diane screams and runs back down the hallway, towards the
          bedroom. The knife wielding figure follows behind her. She
          looks back, as it runs after her, grabbing her by the
          shoulder. She shrieks and struggles out of it's grasp before
          running in the bathroom and slamming the door.
          
          INT. THE BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane throws her weight against the door, struggling to keep
          the intruder out. She looks for anything to help her, and
          then sees in the window to the bathroom...THE AXE WIELDING
          FIGURE standing silently, staring back at her.
          D
           iane collapses to the floor in a pool of tears. She looks up
          again at THE WINDOW: It's empty. The pushing on the door
          suddenly stops, but Diane is so disturbed, she doesn't notice
          through her sobs.
          
                                                     CLOSE ON:
          
          A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVED HANDS puts the bedroom phone back on
          its cradle.

          Mini and Martin laugh and giggle at the enormous slabs of
          beef put in front of them.

          INT. THE HALLWAY OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - LATER.
          
          Mini and Martin walk down the hallway towards the master
          bedroom.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    And we returned home expecting to
                    find her blabbering like a three
                    year old.
          
                              MINI
                    Mom, we're home!

                    Diane, honey, we brought you a
                    pulled pork plate!
          
          They reach the door to the bathroom. It's still closed.
          Martin and Mini exchange a look, not believing that Diane
          could still be in there.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Honey? You okay?...Honey?
          
                               MINI
                    Mom?
          
          Martin tries the door. Diane still appears to be leaning
          against it. He pushes hard on the door, opening it a few
          inches. Mini reaches in and shoves Diane over so they can can
          open the door. She appears drugged. They lay her flat and try
          to wake her up.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Diane, it's us, wake up.
          
          Mini slaps her hard across the face.
          
                              MINI
                        (feigning concern)

          Martin lightly taps Diane's cheeks.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Diane, come on, come on.

          Mini looks up at the counter. AN EMPTY BOTTLE OF PRESCRIPTION
          SLEEPING PILLS lies open next to the sink.

                                  MINI
                       I picked that prescription up three
                       days ago. It was probably more than
                       half full.
          
          The two of them look at each other, studying each other's
          reaction. Seconds go by as both wait for the other to make
          the first move.
          
                                  MINI
                           (eerily calm)
                       I suppose we should call an
                       ambulance?
          
          The suggestion hangs in the air, as Martin feels Diane's
          wrist again.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Her pulse is almost gone.
          
                                 MINI
                       Do you really think they can save
                       her?
          
                                 MARTIN

                       She'll only try it again. You know
                       she will.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       She will if we keep this torture
                       up.
          
          Martin looks down at Diane.

                       Our neighbor, Mike Rudell, the
                       scumbag at my birthday, produces it
                       and it's so twisted, I'm surprised
                       I didn't think of it.
          
          On the screen, the host introduces THE COUPLE, who nervously
          walk out to the studio applause.

                       Take happy couples about to marry
                       and try to break them up. The catch
                       is the couples are always sent on
                       dates with people just a little
                       better looking than their fiancés.
          
          Then the TWO DATES are brought out to sit on either side of
          the couple. Both dates are, indeed, slightly better looking
          than the engaged couple.

          Martin sits on the couch. He looks up as Mini comes in from
          the bathroom, shaking her head "no", indicating she's not
          I
          dead yet.

                                 MINI
                       We can't wait anymore, our alibi is
                       only believable for maybe another
                       hour. We can say that after dinner
                       we went to a movie, but if she
                       hasn't croaked by midnight, you can
                       forget about this.
          
          Martin looks at her for a long moment, clearly realizing the
          implications of "speed this up".
          
                                 MARTIN
                       No, I'm sorry, this is going

                                 MINI
                       Oh, but you were prepared to sit
                       here until the pills did her in? I
                       hate to break it to you, but
                       wherever you "weren't prepared to
                       go"...the hypocrite express just
                       rolled into the station.
          
          Martin stares straight ahead, coming to grips with the truth
          of his actions.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       What are you suggesting?
          
                                 MINI
                       Well, I thought we'd disembowel her
                       and leave her for the raccoons.
          
          Martin recoils.

          Mini goes through her mother's clothes, as Diane lies
          crumpled in a heap on the floor. Martin looks on impatiently.

                    in our hearts it would come to
                    this. And as my first assisted
                    suicide, I was going to make it

          Mini applying make-up and lipstick to Diane's face in front

          Martin, carrying Diane (now dressed in the suit) over his
          shoulder, struggles through the doorway.

          Mini props Diane up in the driver's seat and begins touching
          up the make-up. She ties a silk scarf around Diane's neck,
          ever so elegantly. Satisfied, she turns the ignition key and
          lowers all the power windows in the car. She looks up at
          Martin.
          
                              MINI
                    Well, if you've got anything to say
                    to her, now would be the time.
          
                              MARTIN

                    little remorse?

          Mini and Martin walk through the door to the garage and close
          it behind them. The hum of the car engine can he heard
          through the wall.
          
          INT. THE GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Diane sits in the driver's seat, as THE EXHAUST PIPE spews
          E
          fumes into the sealed garage.
          
           XT. THE HOUSE - LATER.
          
          The garage door is open and Diane's body is visible on the
          garage floor as Martin and Mini kneel beside her. The wail of
          an ambulance siren is heard as it pulls up in front, cutting
          the engine. Mini comes running outside in tears.
          
                              MINI
                    Help us, please! My mom, I think

          TWO PARAMEDICS try to revive Diane, having laid her out on
          the floor of the garage. Mini sobs hysterically, as Martin
          hugs her.

          Two POLICE CRUISERS are parked outside as Diane's body, now
          wrapped in a body bag, is being wheeled into the ambulance.
          
          A FEW "LOOKY LOOS" are standing at the gates to the house,
          interested to see what's happened.

          One of the paramedics fills out a report on a clipboard in
          the background, as Martin continues to comfort Mini. A MAN,
          30, with a slightly weary look, walks in the front door
          wearing an off-the-rack grey suit and barber shop haircut.

                           (sharply)
                       Mini, it's okay...just go lie down
                       for a moment.
          
          INT. THE GARAGE- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Martin stands in the garage with Garson, going over what
          happened.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       So after dinner and the movie, we
                       came home at around 11:30 and found
                       her in the garage. I turned off the
                       car and opened the garage door to
                       let out the exhaust.
          
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                  69.

                                 GARSON
                       What about trying to revive your
                       wife?
          
          Martin seems a bit taken aback by the question.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Of course, we did that too, but I
                       couldn't feel a pulse. Mini took a
                       course at school in CPR and tried
                       that, but...
                           (taking a breath)
                       it didn't work.
          
                                 GARSON
                       So your wife did this sometime
                       between 8:00 and 11:33 when you
                       placed the 911 call?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yes.
          
                                 GARSON
                       May I ask why you left your wife
                       alone when she had been acting in
                       such an unstable state?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       We never thought she'd do anything
                       like...this. After the episode in
                       the mall, Diane hadn't left the
                       house for three days and my
                       daughter and I just needed a break.
                       It's been a very stressful time.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Of course. So this was your wife's
                       car?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yes.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Was it in the garage when you left
                       for dinner or did she drive it in?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       What?
          
                                 GARSON
                       Was it in the garage when you left?

                              MARTIN
                    Oh, well...after she was brought
                    home from the mall, the car was
                    towed here and we put it in the
                    garage.
          
                              GARSON
                    And no one drove it during those
                    three days?
          
                              MARTIN
                    No, Mini and I have our own cars.
          
                               GARSON
                    We are going to have to impound it
                    for a few days to take it to the
                    crime lab.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Crime lab? Oh, okay.
          
                              GARSON
                    Again, purely routine.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Sure.
          
                              GARSON
                    Have you found a note yet?
          
                               MARTIN
                        (confused)
                    I'm sorry?
          
          Garson's eyes flicker for a split second.
          
                              GARSON
                    A suicide note? The deceased
                    usually leaves one.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Oh...right, no...not yet. But we
                    haven't really looked.

          Martin hesitates for just a split second.
          
                              MARTIN
                    No...of course not.
          
          INT. MINI'S BEDROOM- MOMENTS LATER.

                              MINI
                    Who cares if we didn't leave a
                    note? Just relax.
          
                              MARTIN

                    So what? He'll do his little dance
                    and chalk it up to another failed
                    actress who realized after forty
                    she might as well be dead.

                              MINI
                    I already snuck out the back and
                    threw them in Mike Rudell's garbage

                       be good idea if we took a vacation
                       and went somewhere where we could
                       act like a real couple for the

                       Martin agreed and let me pick the
                       place. I chose Las Hadas in
                       Mexico, because that's where Dudley
                       Moore and Bo Derek did it in Ten.

                       I figured sugar daddy/younger woman
                       would be old news down there.

                       I could feel that Martin had let
                       the whole thing with the cops go.
                       It had been two weeks since Mom's
                       death and it already felt like it
                       happened a year ago.

          Mini lies on top of Martin on a lounge chair. They both stare

          Martin and Mini look up to see MIKE RUDELL, their producer
          neighbor, peering at them in the dark. He has an arm wrapped
          around the waist of A YOUNG BLONDE who is clearly Playmate
          material.

                       to wet himself.
          
          Mini quickly sits up, trying to make it look like innocent
          father/daughter closeness.

                       Last week Mini mentioned you two
                       were coming here for a little R&R,
                       and I suddenly realized I hadn't
                       taken a vacation in god knows when.
                       Jennifer, this is my neighbor
                       Martin Tannen and his daughter,
                       Mini.
          
          Martin barely looks at Jennifer as he shakes her hand. She
          looks equally uncomfortable.

          Jennifer looks quite uneasy, as she forces a smile.

                    I wanted you both to know how sorry
                    I am for your loss.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Our loss? He just lost six or
                    seven freebies a year.

                    If there's anything I can do...
                        (to Mini)
                    for either of you...

                    Yikes, now that Mom's out of the
                    way, I guess I'm fair game.
          
                              MIKE
                    ...don't hesitate to ask. Remember
                    I'm just right across the fence.
          
          The meaning is not lost on Martin.

          INT. THEIR HOTEL ROOM - LATER.
          
          Martin paces back and forth as Mini sits on the bed. His neck
          muscles bulge with frustration.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Why did you tell him?!
          
                              MINI
                    I was just being friendly, I had no
                    idea he'd decide to come here.
          
                              MARTIN
                    He knows. He found the clothes and
                    goggles and he fucking knows!
          
                              MINI

                       You're overreacting. It's just
                       coincidence.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Yeah, well coincidence or not, he
                       saw us together.

                       toying with us.
          
                                 MINI
                       Just relax, what is he going to do?
                       Go home and tell everyone we're a
                       couple? We'll just laugh it off and
                       tell everyone he vacations with
                       hookers.
          
          Martin stops and looks at her, surprised.

          His face turns a little red.

                       I'm not jealous or anything, I just
                       think it's funny. Talk about six
                       degrees of penetration.
          
          Martin rubs his temples, clearly overwhelmed.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       You realize he could blackmail us?
                       If the police found out about us,
                       that suicide wouldn't look so
                       routine.

                       Martin, please, calm down. Trust
                       me, nothing is going to happen.
          
          Her words don't appear to have calmed him.
          
                                                                     76.
          
          
          
          EXT. THE POOL - DAY
          
          Martin sits on a lounger, reading a book and looking very
          unhappy. From the pool, Mini emerges, soaking wet in a
          bikini.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    The next few days were a laugh
                    riot.
          
          Martin looks up from the book, looking around suspiciously.
          Suddenly, Mini appears behind him and gives him a kiss on the
          mouth. He instinctively pulls back.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Suddenly, Martin was acting like he
                    really was my father.
          
          Just then, Rudell and his bimbo enter the pool area, waving
          at them. Mini's head is not close enough for the scene to
          look incriminating, but Martin is too spooked to know the
          difference.
          
          INT. THE TANNEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
          
          Mini and Martin sit watching TV. Mini flips channels,
          stopping at Absolutely, Positive! Martin snatches the remote
          and grumpily changes M
                               channels. Mini looks very annoyed.

                    We returned home and things didn't

          Mini answers it, having removed her Marilyn wig, but still in

                       Well, it's just a little unusual
                       for a suicide victim to use two
                       methods. Her choices seemed, I

                       Okie fine, this may be the most
                       exciting thing I've done in a
                       while, but even I know when the
                       rush isn't worth the risk.

                       when my father's around. He'll be

          EXT. THE POOL - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone,
          while sucking on a red popsicle.

                    I played it cool, it would've
                    looked worse to be defensive.
          
          Mini looks across the yard to see...
          
          MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of
          his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is
          smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are
          locked on hers.
          
                              MARTIN (V.O.)
                    Well, when's he coming over?

                    Tonight!? I've got a dinner with
                    Chapman. I've already cancelled--
                        (frustrated)
                    Damn it! Why didn't you call me?!
          
          RUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze,
          revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. He's in good
          shape for a man his age.

          Mini responds to Rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her
          bikini top.

          Mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from

          INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING
          
          Martin and Mini sit across from Garson. Martin appears cool
          and relaxed, a scotch in his hand.
          
                                 GARSON
                       I really appreciate you taking the
                       time to help us out. There's just a
                       few loose ends we want to tie up.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Absolutely. What would you like to
                       know?
          
          Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report. He starts
                               G
          leafing through papers.
          
                                  ARSON
                       There appears to be some question
                       as to the time of death. You said
                       you went to dinner and a movie-

                       Detective, not to be overly
                       sensitive, but do I need my lawyer
                       here? Because these sound like the
                       questions one asks when there's a
                       homicide investigation.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Mr. Tannen, I'd really like to just
                       finish this up, I've got real
                       homicides that need attention. How
                       about if I just ask you some
                       questions and the one's you don't
                       want to answer, we'll just skip?

          escape for a second.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Fair enough.

                       Terrific...now, the preliminary
                       blood report indicated she had
                       ritalin in her system.
          
          Mini's eyes shift between Garson and his note pad.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I wasn't aware my wife was taking
                       ritalin.
          
                                 GARSON
                       Neither was her physician, he had
                       never prescribed it.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Well, as you may have discovered by
                       now, my wife had substance abuse
                       problems, I'm sure there were many
                       drugs she took without a
                       prescription.
          
                                 GARSON
                       I know, but it's an odd drug to be
                       taking. It's mostly given to adults
                       and children with Attention Deficit
                       Disorder to calm them. But in
                       people who don't need it, it has
                       the reverse effect, making them
                       incredibly hyper and agitated.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Again, Detective, I really can't
                       say why she was taking these drugs.

                       separate lives. We had decided to

                    Listen, Detective Garson, I must
                    admit I don't see the relevance of
                    these questions. Diane was an
                    extremely disturbed person. Haven't
                    you interviewed enough people who
                    saw her at her worst?
          
                              GARSON
                    Yes, but what I'm still unclear
                    about is her time of death.

                              MARTIN
                    Well, I'm telling you the next time
                    you have a question, it had better
                    be because you're charging us-

          Martin momentarily freezes.
          
                              MARTIN
                    I'm just asking you to please let
                    us deal with our grief and get on
                    with our lives.

                    Thanks again for your time.

          Mini sits in a chair as Martin paces.
          
                              MARTIN
                    What the hell was I thinking,
                    letting you talk me into this?
          
                              MINI
                    It's probably just routine stuff.
          
                              MARTIN
                    That was not routine, my dear.
          
                              MINI
                    Nice use of the word "us", by the
                    way.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Sorry, it just slipped out.

                       Chill?! Believe me, we'll be
                       chilling in a pine box if he

                       He's probably just trying to spook

                                 MINI
                       It was a great plan, no one can
                       prove we stuck those sleeping pills
                       in her mouth, because we didn't.

                       Well, if it was such a great plan,

                       who appears convinced it wasn't a
                       suicide?
          
          Mini glares at him and then stands up, heading inside.

          INT. A DANCE CLUB IN EAGLE ROCK - NIGHT
          
          The club is packed with YOUNG LATINO CLUBHOPPERS gyrating to
          the pulsating beat. Mini, in a tight crimson dress, has
          attracted quite a crowd, as she dances very provocatively
          with a MUSCULAR YOUNG LATINO.

                               MINI (V.O.)
                    Would he follow?
          
          His face and shoulders glisten with sweat, as she lifts one
          leg around his waist and then the other. As she straddles
          him, their hips rocking together, she puts her arms around
          his neck and leans all the way back, her hair hanging down in
          ecstasy.
          
          As she pulls herself back up, her eyes scan the room.
          
          MARTIN stands in the back, watching her, his eyes sullen.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Was there any question?
          
          Mini's eyes move quickly enough past him that it's ambiguous
          to him whether she spotted him or not.
          
          Martin watches as Mini leans in and in SLOW MOTION gives her
          partner a deep, long kiss. MARTIN looks ill.
          
          EXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - DAWN
          
          Mini's car pulls into the driveway. She gets out, looking
          rumpled.
          
          INT. THE KITCHEN- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Mini walks in to find Martin, sitting at the table in a
          bathrobe. He's reading the paper, with a cup of coffee. Mini
          opens the fridge and removes a carton of orange juice, taking
          a big slug.
          
                              MARTIN
                    A phone call would have been
                    appreciated at some point. I was
                    worried.

                       aware, but at this point you can't
                       be my dad and my lover. Where I go

                       and I can assure you I won't end up

                       What the hell's gotten into you? I
                       just expressed concern for you and
                       you turn around and threaten me?
                       Mini, in a relationship, it's okay
                       to worry about someone else.

                       I kind of have to admire this. He
                       really is one of the world's

          The questions hangs in the air. Mini looks down, almost
          ashamed.

                    Fake tears aside...he actually was
                    my first relationship. Which, in
                    itself, was significant, because I
                    had always felt that by living my
                    life by the rule of firsts, I would
                    never be able to find someone who
                    could accept me on those terms.
          
          INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - MORNING
          
          He strides off the elevator sending "hellos" and nods to his
          employees, as he passes the large corporate logo: "BOYD,
          MATHER, TANNEN & ASSOCIATES".
          
                              MINI (V.O.)

                    chance to be that person...
          
          He reaches his desk, where his YOUNG SECRETARY, LOIS, is
          waiting with an envelope.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)

          She hands him a manila envelope marked "MARTIN TANNEN- VIA
          MESSENGER". He takes it from her and walks into his office,
          sitting down. He opens the package to find an 8x10 glossy

                       interesting.
          
          Martin looks up, the empty look in his eyes revealing a
          terrified mind already calculating the potential outcomes. He
          examines THE ENVELOPE. There is a SPEEDWAY COURIER STICKER,
          but no return address.
          
          INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
          
          Martin angrily honks his horn in slow traffic as he talks on
          his cell.

                       I know...Tell him...tell him it's

                       What do you mean you don't keep
                       records on who your senders are?

                       When it's paid cash, we only keep

          EXT. THE SPEEDWAY BRANCH - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martin walks outside, frustrated. His cell goes off and he
          answers it.

                       that he's going to be seeking a new
                       firm to handle his company's needs.
          
          Martin's jaw tightens.
          
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)

                                 MARTIN
                       Thank you, Lois.
          
          Martin hangs up the phone, as he looks up, he sees across the
          street a large sign on a modern office building: RUDELL
          WORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT.
          
          Martin closes his eyes, trying to remain in control.
          
          INT. A CONFERENCE ROOM AT MARTIN'S FIRM - LATER.
          
          Martin walks into the office to find his partners, STEVE BOYD
          and CHARLES MATHER waiting for him. Martin looks surprised
          and concerned.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Steve? Charlie? What, what are
                       you doing in town? Why didn't you
                       tell me you were coming--
                                 M
                                  ATHER
                       We just heard about Chapman...not
                       that it matters.
          
                                 BOYD
                       We can't afford to lose any more
                       clients.
          
          The color drains from Martin's face.
          
                                  MARTIN
                       Jesus, guys, my wife just committed
                       suicide...
          
                                 MATHER
                       No one's saying this isn't a
                       difficult time for you, but
                       whatever's been distracting you
                       started long before that.
          
                                 BOYD
                       There's just no way to sugarcoat
                       this...you're a liability we can't
                       afford anymore...
          
          Martin sits very still, his world crumbling around him.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Fifteen years...we've been--

                           (curtly)
                       We'll be asking all our clients who
                       they would prefer to stay with, and
                       of course, you'll have an equal
                       shot to make your case with them.
          
          Martin continues to stare off into space, reeling.
          
          INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
          
          Martin sits in the traffic on Beverly Glen. The veins in his
          neck are starting to bulge as he stares straight ahead.
          Suddenly, he starts pounding on the steering wheel.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Fucking shit! Fucking shit! Fucking
                       shit!
          
          Just then, he looks over to the next car. A three year old
          GIRL in the back seat holds up her "PO" TELETUBBY DOLL to
          show him.
          
          CLOSE ON: AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE-
          
          NIGHT.
          
          Through a BINOCULAR'S VIEWFINDER: Rudell is seen through the
          window talking on the phone, unaware he's being watched.
          
                                 MARTIN (O.S.)
                       Look at that smug prick...He's
                       fucking with me and I will not be
                       fucked with.
          
          INT. THE KITCHEN OF THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Martin and Mini stand in the dark kitchen, as Martin peers
          out the window through binoculars at RUDELL across the yard.
          
                                 MINI
                       What are you gonna do?
          
          Martin goes to a drawer and removes the LARGE KNIFE they
          bought at Williams Sonoma.

                       I'm gonna go over there and tell
                       him to back off or he's gonna get
                       hurt.

                       My god, the picture was dropped off
                       at a messenger service right across
                       the street from his office! He was
                       the only person at the resort who
                       knew who we were!
          
                                 MINI
                       He could go to the cops and tell
                       them you threatened him, then
                       they'd really start investigating
                       us. It's just one photo and you
                       can't even really tell if it's me.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       That son of bitch just cost me the
                       firm I worked fifteen years to
                       build.

                       Well, if you start waving that
                       thing around, he's gonna cost you a
                       lot more than that.
          
          INT. THEIR BEDROOM - LATER.
          
          Mini lies awake, looking annoyed as Martin keeps turning and
          shifting in bed.

                       Martin didn't sleep at all that
                       night and made damn well sure I
                       didn't either.
          
          EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF MIKE RUDELL'S HOUSE - MORNING
          
          Mini walks up the long driveway.

                       With Mommy Dearest out of the way,
                       I decided to take the matter of
                       Rudell into my own hands. I knew
                       Martin wouldn't approve, but at
                       this point...action had to be
                       taken.
          
          She arrives at the front door and rings the bell.

                       disorient him and then kill him...
          
          The door opens and Rudell stands before her in the same plush
          bathrobe.

                       It's been hard, but I guess I've
                       just been telling myself that she's
                       probably much happier where she is
                       now.

                       Well, that too, but "correct" was

                       Sure, those dates are really quite
                       harmless. You just spend an evening
                       with the person. We prep you on

                    younger women are an

                    ...accepted part of society, but
                    for someone to do that, well...it's
                    just tasteless.
          
                               MINI
                    Exactly, so we're just trying to
                    figure who Rit could be.

                    Hmm, I haven't noticed anyone at
                    all...Out of curiosity, what kind
                    of a picture could they send you to
                    indicate that you and Martin were
                    together?
          
                              MINI
                    Oh, it wasn't like we were naked or
                    anything. I mean, of course, he's
                    seen me naked, he is my step-
                    father.

          Mini and Rudell sit at a table, enjoying iced teas, as Mini
          flirts shamelessly with him.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    Much to my surprise, I was invited
                    to stay for a refreshing
                    beverage...

          Rudell shows Mini around his collection of rare tropical
          flowers. He plucks a tiger lily off a stem and puts it in her
          hair.

                       I knew he had had no shortage of
                       young women in his bed, but he had
                       been paying for it in one form or
                       another for a long time.

          Rudell shows Mini how to use a pitching wedge on the small
          putting green off his back patio. He stands behind her,
          wrapping his arms around her, guiding her arms through the
          swing.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       And the one undeniable fact I had
                       learned from Martin is that there
                       is no greater thrill or triumph in
                       a man's life...
          
          INT. RUDELL'S KITCHEN - LATER.
          
          Rudell makes her a giant banana split, covering it with whip
          cream.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)

                       to open the gates to heaven for no
                       other reason than she wanted to.
          
          He accidently gets some whip cream on his nose. Mini reaches
          over and wipes it off, licking her finger clean. Rudell tries
          to hide the wonderment in his eyes.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Frankly, I'm surprised the
                       anticipation of pulling off a
                       mother-daughter double dip didn't
                       give him a stroke right there.

                       had turned Rudell into a trout on a

                       The photos stopped coming and
                       although Martin was freaking out
                       about his business, things were
                       returning to normal. I even decided
                       to return to school.
          
          They approach TROY, the football player she humiliated
          earlier. Mini raises two fingers to her mouth in a "V",
          simulating cunnilingus, taunting Troy. His friends laugh and
          he wilts, pretending he didn't see her.

          Mini and Kayla walk in with other students. Her teacher,
          Warren Bishop, comes over to her immediately.

          Mini immediately sizes up the situation and takes on the

          hallways is seen.

                       Mini, this tape was shot a week
                       before your mother's death.
          
          The door to the nurses office is seen opening and Nurse
          Hauptführer walks out.

                       The next day, the school nurse
                       reported two bottles of Ritalin
                       missing from the medicine cabinet.
          
          A few seconds later, Mini is seen entering the nurse's
          office, checking over her shoulder to make sure no one saw
          her. THE TAPE FREEZES, then fast forwards. Mini is seen
          leaving the office, stuffing something in her pocket.

          A TV and VCR sit on a rolling cabinet in the corner, as

          Andrews is not pleased.

                       door and the inside of the medicine
                       cabinet. They don't match the

                       The final toxicology report came
                       back and your wife definitely
                       didn't die from the pills. She
                       wasn't conscious past 9:30, but it
                       was the fumes that killed her.

                                  ARTIN
                       Well, hallelujah, thanks for the
                       update-
          
                                 VOLANT
                       Martin, easy.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I'm sorry, but this is harassment.
          
                                 GARSON
                       See, here's what I needed to ask
                       you. The gas tank in the Jag was
                       almost full, just a gallon had been
                       used.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       And?
          
                                 GARSON
                       Well, if she was unconscious by
                       9:30, that means the car must have
                       been running for at least two hours
                       when you found her. An unconscious
                       person can't turn on a car, right?
          
                                 VOLANT
                       Detective, with all due respect,
                       could you get to the point?
          
                                 GARSON
                       Well, here's where I get confused,
                       see, that particular model idling
                       for two hours will burn at least
                       four gallons of gas.
          
          Martin tries to remain calm, as the panic starts to settle in
          for a long stay.
          
                                 GARSON
                       So, there's really no way the tank
                       could be almost full if it was
                       running for two hours. Is there?
          
          He looks at Martin, waiting for an answer.
          
          
                                                             (CONTINUED)
          
                                                                 103.

                              GARSON
                    So, I guess what I'm asking is,
                    whose idea was it to put her in the
                    car?
          
                              VOLANT
                    Martin, don't say anything.
          
                              GARSON
                    Now, Mr. Tannen, you clearly had
                    the most to gain from her death,
                    but I've learned from a number of
                    your wife's friends that she and
                    Mini had a strained relationship.
          
                              VOLANT
                    Again, Detective, my client won't
                    be answering anything, so let's
                    just cut the cat and mouse.
          
                              GARSON
                    I'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if
                    he's trying to be a protective
                    father by covering up something
                    Mini did, I'd be careful. The
                    district attorney is viewing this
                    case as an opportunity to show the
                    public that the rich don't get away
                    with murder in this town.
          
          Martin whispers something in Volant's ear and he in turn,
                               V
          whispers back.
          
                               OLANT
                    Does this mean he's offering Mr.
                    Tannen immunity if he says he was
                    protecting his daughter?
          
          Garson takes a sip of water, as Martin anxiously waits for
          his answer.
          
                              GARSON
                    It's a strong possibility. But he
                    wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go
                    for the maximum sentence if he
                    doesn't. No manslaughter, no plea
                    bargains, nothing.
          
          Martin's eyes shift slightly.
          
                                                                  104.
          
          
          
          INT. ANOTHER INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Garson, now finished with Martin, sits across from Mini and
          her lawyer, HERB PELHAM, who doesn't look nearly as confident
          as Martin's lawyer.
          
                              MINI
                    It was Colonel Mustard in the
                    library with the candlestick.
          
          Garson smiles at Mini, admiring her resolve.
          
                              PELHAM
                        (nervously)
                    Uh...Miss Drogues, as your lawyer-
          
                              MINI
                    Don't wet your pants, I know when
                    to shut up and swallow...
          
          Mini takes out a sip a water, letting a trickle of liquid
          roll down her chin.
          
                              MINI
                    ...my tongue.
          
          Even Garson appears a little intimidated by the overt
          flirtation.
          
                              GARSON
                    Look, the fact that the marriage
                    was unhappy and there was no pre-
                    nup gives all the motive to Martin.
          
                              MINI
                    So you want me to say it was his
                    idea?
          
                              GARSON
                    If it was his idea, give me one
                    reason you should take the fall?
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    At that moment I knew we had him.
                    If he was trying to get me to rat
                    on Martin, he didn't have enough to
                    charge either one of us.

                       So if I tell the jury it was his
                       idea and I was scared for my life,
                       because he said he'd kill me if I
                       ever told anyone, then I walk?
          
          Garson instinctively leans forward in his chair, just a bit.
          Mini stares into Garson's eyes, unflinching. She looks around
          the room, weighing her options. Pelham attempts to whisper
          something in her ear. She waves him off.
                               M

                       Sorry, sport, but I'll take my
                       chances.
          
          INT. MARTIN'S CAR - LATER.
          
          Mini and Martin drive home together. There is an icy chill
          between them, as Martin looks over at Mini.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       I never doubted for a minute you
                       were going to hold firm. Not a
                       second. I hope you know that?
          
                                 MINI
                       Oh, I knew...I knew.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Good. You realize, we've got to
                       rely on each other?
          
                                 MINI
                       Who else do we have?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Exactly. We're almost home free. My
                       lawyer says that gas gauge theory
                       is circumstantial as hell. I've
                       only got one concern now.
          
                                 MINI
                       What?
          
                                 MARTIN
                       Rudell. If a jury knew we were a
                       couple, we've both got a motive and
                       that changes everything.
          
          Mini puts her hand on Martin's, reassuringly.

                       got rockin' abs and a better
                       hairline.
          
          Martin looks over at her, softening.

                       Garson had succeeded in planting
                       the seeds of distrust.
          
          MINI turns around and Martin ducks into a boutique.
          
          EXT. A MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT
          
          Mini walks out of a movie theater, with Kayla and TWO BOYS.

                       Our relationship had turned into
                       what some might call...
          
          A few seconds later, Martin walks out of the theater, wearing
          dark glasses and a hat. He follows them.

          Mini sits in front of the TV, watching a commercial. She is
          wearing the same "Fuct" T-shirt she wore when we first met

          Martin walks in the front door with his briefcase.

          BLONDE HAIRED ENGAGED COUPLE.
          
          Mini and her male counterpart are just a bit better looking
          than the engaged couple, both of whom have a midwestern
          wholesomeness.

                       Welcome back to Absolutely
                       Positive. Now it's time to hear how
                       the date between Jason and Mini
                       ended.
          
                                 MARTIN
                       You? You went on-
          
                                 MINI
                       Yeah, I thought it'd be a gas...now
                       shhh...

                       Jason, you said that the reason you
                       wanted to come on the show was to
                       test your ability to resist
                       temptation.

                           (a bit nervous)
                       Well, since Becky and I have dated
                       since high school and decided to
                       remain virgins until marriage, I
                       just wanted to go on a date with
                       another girl just to see how I
                       would react. You know, whether
                       there'd be any feelings of doubt
                       about my decision?
          
                                 HOST
                       So, after dinner, what happened?
          
                                 JASON
                       Oh, gosh, well she suggested we go
                       to a dance club she knew. I'm not
                       really a good dancer, but I said
                       "yes."
          
                                  BECKY
                           (hurt)
                       We never go dancing.
          
          Jason smiles at her uncomfortably.
          
                                 HOST
                       So, Mini, is Jason a good dancer?

                    God, Martin, it was a one time
                    thing. He was a virgin, how could
                    I say "no"? Believe me, she'll
                    thank me after their wedding night.
          
                              MARTIN
                    You had me come home early to-

                    Don't be jealous. It won't happen
                    again. It was just a goof.

          BECKY dissolves into a puddle of tears as Jason tries to
          console her. Suddenly, she runs off stage.

                    Yeah, I thought it would be fun. I
                    wasn't really supposed to, you
                    know, "go all the way" but-

                    Clearly, the only thing Jason was
                    positive about was-

                    Oh, by the way, some intern from
                    your office stopped by earlier
                    today with something. It's on the
                    desk.
          
          Martin walks over to the desk and picks up an envelope marked
          "MARTIN TANNEN". He opens it to find...
          
          AN 8x11 PHOTO of him and Mini kissing passionately on the
          beach in Mexico. This time there is no question as to the
          nature of their relationship. Scrawled across the bottom in
          black marker is: "REMEMBER, I'M JUST ACROSS THE FENCE".
          
          Martin's eyes scan the photo, a look of resignation setting
          in.

                              MINI
                    No, this is exactly what he wants!

                              MARTIN
                    Then he can't blackmail me. Wait
                    here, I'll be right back.
          
          Martin heads for the back door.

                                 MARTIN

                    No...
          
          Martin looks unconvinced.
          
                              MINI
                    I just made him think I would, so
                    he wouldn't turn us in.

                        (sarcastically)
                    Thank you, I appreciate your
                    restraint.
          
                              MINI
                    Fuck you. I'd think you'd be a
                    little more appreciative.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Who were you doing it for when you
                    did it with that kid? Huh? Who was
                    that selfless act for!?
          
                              MINI
                    Oh, like you're such a martyr for
                    being faithful? It shows amazing
                    restraint to limit yourself to just
                    one stepdaughter!
          
                              MARTIN
                    Don't lecture me about fidelity!
                    Your mother was cheating within six
                    months of the "I do's"!
          
          He heads for the door again.

                    Now, if you'll excuse me...
          
          Mini grabs him again, desperate.

                    Please-- Look, I'm sorry, I really
                    am, but this isn't the answer!

                    do you hear me?
          
          Mini nods her head.
          
                              MARTIN
                    Now, I want you to wait here for
                    me. Do you understand?

          He lets go and calmly walks towards the sliding doors to the
          back yard. Mini watches him go.
          
          EXT. RUDELL'S FRONT DOOR- MOMENTS LATER.
          
          Martin stands outside and rings the bell. The door opens and
          Rudell stands there in a smoking jacket and pajamas. He looks
          Martin up and down with a self-satisfied smile, as Sinatra's
                               R
          "Nice and Easy" is playing on his stereo in the background.

                              MARTIN
                    Just watched Mini on your show.
          
                              RUDELL
                    Ahh...was tonight the night? We
                    taped that two weeks ago. Let me

                    She was fucking incredible.
          
          Rudell watches Martin's eyes for a reaction.
          
                              MARTIN
                    A natural, huh?

                       willing to take direction.
          
          Martin's jaw tightens, as Rudell is loving twisting the knife
          in him.
          
                                 RUDELL

          staggering backwards inside.

          Mini stands at the window, nervously waiting on the phone.
          She looks out THE WINDOW at the fight beginning in Rudell's
          house.

          Rudell struggles to his feet and charges Martin, shoving him
          against his wet bar. Rudell grabs a glass and smashes it
          over Martin's face, grinding the glass into his face.

          Martin screams in agony and throws Rudell off him. Rudell
          crashes into a glass coffee table, smashing it to pieces.
          
          Martin tries to pick the glass out of his eyes, as Rudell
          gets to his feet and grabs one of metal legs of the shattered
          coffee table.

          Rudell and Martin crash through the plate glass window on to
          the brick patio. Martin gets to his feet first and grabs a
          golf club propped up on a chair next to the putting green.

          Rudell struggles to his feet, just in time to see the
          pitching wedge heading straight for his ribs. THWACK! Martin
          catches him square and he goes down like a sack of potatoes.
          Martin starts hitting him with one swing after another.

          Martin smashes his face into the patio. Rudell lets out a
          moan, grasping at the ground, trying to get up, but his legs
          don't obey him. Martin stands up and grabs the club, raising
          it with both hands above his head for a final swing.

                    Needless to say, my appearance on
                    Absolutely Positive was the most
                    sought after clip in every newsroom
                    in town.

                               MINI (V.O.)
                    The trial was quick. Once Mom's
                    affair with Rudell came out, the
                    D.A. realized he had a motive and a
                    slam dunk.

           HE FOREWOMAN, an elderly hispanic woman, casts a harsh eye
          towards Martin and then reads the verdict.

          Martin stares straight ahead, showing no emotion as Mini sobs
          behind him.

                       Since, Rudell was in a coma, the
                       issue of my relationship with
                       Martin was moot. Martin realized
                       trying to pin anything on me would
                       probably get him the chair.

          Martin, wearing an ORANGE PRISON UNIFORM, is led into a van

                       At his sentencing I begged for
                       leniency. He got off with ten for
                       the attempted murder of Rudell and
                       twenty to life for mom's death.
          
          EXT. THE TANNEN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
          
          Mini opens the door to find reporters camped on the lawn,
          snapping photos. Dozens of bouquets and wreaths are piled up
          next to the front door.

                       amazing.
          
          A MAILMAN hauls a bag of sympathy cards to the front door.
          She leads him inside where he dumps them next to three other
          bags full.
          
          EXT. A DUSTY TWO LANE ROAD IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY - DAY
          
          The sun is blistering hot as Mini drives Martin's Mercedes
          convertible with the top down.
          
                                 MINI (V.O.)
                       Martin's assets were put in a trust
                       for me and since I was eighteen, I
                       was allowed to live by myself.

          Mini and Martin sit facing each other behind a plexiglas
          barrier. There are dividers between each phone to provide the
          prisoners with a little privacy.

                              MINI
                    I was voted valedictorian!

                    The best student? I know! But the
                    students took a vote and they said
                    they wanted me to have it for
                    demonstrating remarkable courage in
                    the face of unspeakable loss.
          
                              MARTIN
                        (smiling sadly)
                    I wonder how the real valedictorian
                    feels?
          
                              MINI
                    Like slitting his wrists with the

                       Mini, if he recovers, he may try to
                       blackmail you with those pictures.

                       I'm pretty sure he won't be doing
                       anything with them.
          
          He looks suddenly very worried.

                       Mini, you're not thinking of
                       sleeping with him to keep him
                       quiet? Because I've met people in
                       here who could help us with him, if
                       it comes to that.

                       could...pay to make sure he doesn't
                       try to take advantage of you.

                       Oh, gosh, that's so romantic. It's

                    Rudell didn't send those pictures.

          smile.

                    What a sweetie, I thought I might
                    have to fuck him, but just giving
                    him the camera was enough.

                    It was pretty clear Garson wasn't
                    gonna give up, and sooner or later
                    he'd find enough to charge us. It
                    just seemed ridiculous that we'd
                    both end up suffering.

                    you little bitch!

                    Daddy, stop! I love you! Don't say
                    that! I love you!
          
          Finally, the guard smashes Martin with a billy club, sending
          him sprawling on the floor. Martin screams behind the glass,
          but cannot be heard, as the guard hog ties him and drags him
          away by his feet.
          
          EXT. A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY - DAY
          
          SENIORS in gowns sit awaiting their diplomas, as PARENTS sit
          in the audience, fanning themselves with programs. Mini
          stands at the dais, addressing the class.
          
                              MINI (V.O.)
                    ...As many of you know, the past
                    few months of my life have been
                    very difficult. I don't know how I
                    would have gotten through it
                    without all of you. I really think
                    it is a testament to the love in
                    this institution, that I stand
                    before you today, as the first
                    straight "C" student in school
                    history voted Valedictorian.
          
          A FEW CHEERS go up from the rowdier students.

          CONTINUED:
                       Again, to Marvin Tepperman, the
                       real valedictorian, he deserved
                       this and I want to wish him a
                       speedy recovery. I spoke to his
                       doctors today and they say, with
                       medication and therapy, Marvin
                       should be able to attend Harvard
                       this fall.
          
          A polite smattering of applause is heard.
          
                                  MINI
                       While I may not have excelled in
                       the classroom, I think my recent
                       experiences in that bigger
                       schoolhouse we call "life", have
                       taught me a few lessons that I'd
                       like to share with my fellow
                       graduates.
          
          Her classmates instinctively lean forward a little to listen.
          
                                 MINI
                       Follow your heart and don't
                       question it, now matter where it
                       tells you to go. Trust me, it'll
                       open up a world of new experiences
                       you can't even imagine.
          
          Principal Andrews nods in approval.
          
                                 MINI
                       But as you listen to it, don't
                       forget your family, your parents.
                       Don't forget they're people too,
                       and while we may not always agree
                       with them, remember to love them
                       when they need love.
          
          A few PARENTS look almost surprised to hear positive things
          said about them.

                       And I mean really love them, don't
                       just pay them lip service. Really
                       do it...Whenever you can.

                    I know I did, and I just wish my
                    dad could be here today, so after
                    this speech I could just walk down
                    into the audience and give him my
                    love right here...in front of all
                    of you. Thank you and good luck.
          
          Mini puts her speech down, gently sobbing, as THE AUDIENCE
          ERUPTS. PRINCIPAL ANDREWS moves quickly to console her.

                    Like I promised, no prom night
                    highjinks, no nerds becoming
                    popular, no Shakespeare shoved up
                    your ass.
          
          MINI'S FELLOW GRADUATES give her a standing ovation. A few
          PARENTS become misty-eyed.

                    about having no one to identify
                    with but me, relax...
          
          MINI looks out across the crowd and a huge smile ripples
          across her face, as she waves to everyone in the golden
          sunlight.
