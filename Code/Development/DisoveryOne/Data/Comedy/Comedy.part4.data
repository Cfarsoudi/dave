               In baseball, you don't know nothing.

                         --Yogi Berra

                

               Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better 
               learn baseball.

                         --Jacques Barzun

                

               You could look it up.

                         --Casey Stengel

                

               Titles over --

               FADE IN:

               A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient.

               BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant 
               upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The 
               huge bat in an elegant follow-through...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them 
               all, a balletic whirling dervish.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag.  
               Too late.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking 
               down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five.

               PULLBACK REVEALS:

               A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table 
               covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old 
               baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- 
               also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora 
               Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it 
               glows with the candles like some religious altar.

               We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I believe in the Church of Baseball.
                              (beat)
                         I've tried all the major religions 
                         and most of the minor ones -- I've 
                         worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, 
                         Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and 
                         Isadora Duncan...

               PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon 
               light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a 
               small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up.

               ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, 
               knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern 
               lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, 
               National and International borders. She's cosmic.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I know things. For instance --
                              (beat)
                         There are 108 beads in a Catholic 
                         rosary. And --
                              (beat)
                         There are 108 stitches in a baseball.
                              (beat)
                         When I learned that, I gave Jesus a 
                         chance.
                              (beat)
                         But it just didn't work out between 
                         us. The Lord laid too much guilt on 
                         me. I prefer metaphysics to theology.
                              (beat)
                         You see, there's no guilt in 
                         baseball... and it's never boring.

               ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the 
               door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps.  
               She sits on a bench and

                                     ANNIE
                         Which makes it like sex.
                              (beat)
                         There's never been a ballplayer slept 
                         with me who didn't have the best 
                         year of his career.
                              (beat)
                         Making love is like hitting a baseball --
                         you just got to relax and concentrate.

               ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up 
               her calves as she does.

                                     ANNIE
                         Besides, I'd never sleep with a player 
                         hitting under .250 unless he had a 
                         lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove 
                         man up the middle.
                              (beat)
                         A woman's got to have standards.

               SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side.  
               Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.

                                     ANNIE
                         The young players start off full of 
                         enthusiasm and energy but they don't 
                         realize that come July and August 
                         when the weather is hot it's hard to 
                         perform at your peak level.
                              (beat)
                         The veterans pace themselves better.  
                         They finish stronger. They're great 
                         in September.
                              (beat)
                         While I don't believe a woman needs 
                         a man to be fulfilled, I do confess 
                         an interest in finding the ultimate 
                         guy -- he'd have that youthful 
                         exuberance but the veteran's sense 
                         of timing...

               ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official 
               scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.

                                     ANNIE
                         Y'see there's a certain amount of 
                         "life-wisdom" I give these boys.
                              (beat)
                         I can expand their minds. Sometimes 
                         when I've got a ballplayer alone 
                         I'll just read Emily Dickinson or 
                         Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so 
                         sweet -- they always stay and listen.
                              (beat)
                         Of course a guy will listen to 
                         anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

               ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, 
               in her cleavage.

                                     ANNIE
                         I make then feel confident. They 
                         make me feel safe. And pretty.

               ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress 
               along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. 
               Stylish and slightly mad.

                                     ANNIE
                         What I give them lasts a life-time.  
                         What they give me lasts 142 games.  
                         Sometimes it seems like a bad trade.
                              (quickly rebounding)
                         But bad trades are part of baseball -- 
                         who can forget Frank Robinson or 
                         Milt Pappas, for Godsakes!
                              (beat)
                         It's a long season and you got to 
                         trust it.

               ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK

               A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe 
               house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.

               ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic, 
               old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other 
               people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM 
               BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.

                                     ANNIE
                         I've tried them all -- I really have --
                              (beat)
                         and the only church that truly feeds 
                         the soul -- day in, day out -- is 
                         the Church of Baseball.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK

               Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium 
               carved into the center of an old Tobacco town.

               People are arriving on foot from all around...

               "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.

               CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate 
               doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup 
               full of twists and goofy choreography.

                                     RECORDING OVER P.A.
                         One o'clock, two o'clock, three 
                         o'clock, rock... Four o'clock, five 
                         o'clock, six o'clock rock...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped 
               off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to 
               her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and 
               friend.

               A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women, 
               dressed in tight pants, tight everything.

               Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.

               FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special 
               box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".

               EXT/INT. THE DURHAM BULL DUGOUT -- NIGHT

               As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and -- 
               THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short 
               for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with 
               his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer 
               whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.

               LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink 
               bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly 
               together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the 
               giant chaw into his mouth.

                         No. The guy's professional debut and 
                         he forgets about it.

                                     LARRY
                         Better find our bonus baby, eh?

               A PLAYER, DEKE, 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth.

               short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of EBBY 
               CALVIN LALOOSH, baseball cap on backwards. EBBY is a great 
               looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence, 
               naivete and horniness of youth.

               Life is a party.

               A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly.

               EBBY WHIRLS as Skip enters.

                         'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard

                         You didn't get "lured". Women never 
                         get lured. They're too strong and 
                         powerful for that. Now say it -- "I 
                         didn't get lured and I will take 
                         responsibility for my actions".

                         fastball but sometimes has problems

               point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever 
               he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the

                         I don't trust a man who don't dance.  
                         It ain't natural.

               SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box. Several 
               couples dance, and out of the pack --

               EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling, 
               uninhibited and infectious. He's suddenly dancing with a 
               different WOMAN, then another, and another...

               ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.

                                     MAX
                         Who's he dancing with?

                                     ANNIE
                         All of 'em, I think...

               EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole 
               bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish.  
               A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show. More naive, fun. He 
               climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.

                                     EBBY
                         Thanks for the note -- you're right, 
                         I wasn't bending my back.

                                     ANNIE
                         You got a live arm there.

               He extends his hand to introduce himself.

                                     EBBY
                         Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

                                     ANNIE
                         You need a nickname.

                                     EBBY
                         That's what I been telling everybody!  
                         Wanta dance?

                                     CRASH
                         She's dancing with me.

                                     ANNIE
                         Crash, I didn't think you --

                                     CRASH
                         I'll learn. C'mon --

                                     EBBY
                         Just a minute, pal...

               The two men square off quickly. Annie mocks them.

                                     ANNIE
                         You boys gonna fight over little me?

               CRASH RISES, pulling Annie with him. But --

               EBBY STANDS to challenge Crash.

                                     EBBY
                         Step outside, pal.

                                     CRASH
                         Love to --

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh don't be such guys --

               But Crash and Ebby head outside. She turns to Max --

                                     ANNIE
                         Hell, Max, wanta dance?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

               A circle is formed. Everybody gathers. Millie clings to Tony, 
               her guy of the moment. Crash and Ebby face off.

                                     CRASH
                         I don't believe in fighting.

                                     EBBY
                         Pussy.

                                     CRASH
                         Take the first shot at me.

                                     EBBY
                         I ain't hitting a man first.

                                     CRASH
                         Hit me in the chest with this...

               CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to 
               Ebby.

                                     EBBY
                         I'd kill ya.

                                     CRASH
                         From what I hear you couldn't hit a 
                         bull in the ass with a slingshot

                                     EBBY
                         Don't try me.

                                     CRASH
                         Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.

                                     EBBY
                         No way.

                                     CRASH
                         C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause 
                         you're starting to think about it 
                         already, you're starting to think 
                         how embarrassing it'll be to miss, 
                         how all these people would laugh.
                              (teasing mercilessly)
                         C'mon, Rook -- show me that million 
                         dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good 
                         idea about the five cent head --

               EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, 
               right at Crash's chest. But, alas --

               THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.  
               Crash never blinks.

                                     CRASH
                         Ball four.

               EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.

                                     EBBY
                         Who the fuck are you?!

               CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed, 
               effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there 
               stunned. He looks up.

                                     CRASH
                         I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher.  
                         And you just got Lesson Number One --
                         "Don't think -- it can only hurt the 
                         ballclub".
                              (beat)
                         Buy ya a drink?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE CLUB -- NIGHT

               ANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box. Millie 
               and Tony are also on the dance floor.

                                     ECKSTEIN
                              (on juke box)
                         April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, 
                         Holiday tables under the tree...

               EBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right 
               eye is blackened. He holds a drink on it.

                                     EBBY
                         We fight, she gets the clown -- how's 
                         that happen?

                                     CRASH
                         Shut up -- I like this song...
                              (sings along)
                         April in Paris, this is a feeling, 
                         No one can ever reprieve...

                                     EBBY
                         She's playing with my mind.

                                     CRASH
                         It's a damn easy thing to play with.

               ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well -- you boys stopped fighting 
                         yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love 
                         a little macho male bonding -- I 
                         think it's sweet even if it's probably 
                         latent homosexuality being "re-
                         channeled" but I believe in "re-
                         channeling" so who cares, right?
                              (beat)
                         Shall we go to my place?

                                     EBBY
                         Which one of us?

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh both of you, of course...

               CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder.

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles.

               THE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles.

               EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men 
               look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous 
               than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor 
               league career.

                                     ANNIE
                         These are the ground rules.
                              (beat)
                         I hook up with one guy a season -- I 
                         mean it takes me a couple of weeks 
                         to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring 
                         training...
                              (beat)
                         And, well, you two are the most 
                         promising prospects of the season so 
                         far.
                              (beat)
                         So... I thought we should get to 
                         know each other.

                                     CRASH
                         Why do you get to choose? Why don't 
                         I get to choose?

                                     ANNIE
                         Actually none of us on this planet 
                         ever really choose each other. It's 
                         all Quantum Physics and molecular 
                         attraction. There are laws we don't 
                         understand that bring us together 
                         and break us apart.

                                     EBBY
                         Is somebody gonna go to bed with 
                         somebody or what?

                                     ANNIE
                         You're a regular nuclear meltdown, 
                         honey -- slow down.

               Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.

                                     CRASH
                         After 12 years in the minor leagues, 
                         I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't 
                         believe in, Quantum Physics when it 
                         comes to matters of the heart... or 
                         loins.

                                     ANNIE
                              (challenging him)
                         What do you believe in?

               Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting.  
               He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:

                                     CRASH
                         I believe in the soul, the cock, the 
                         pussy, the small of a woman's back, 
                         the hanging curve ball, high fiber, 
                         good scotch, long foreplay, show 
                         tunes, and that the novels of Thomas 
                         Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated 
                         crap.
                              (beat)
                         I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald 
                         acted alone, I believe that there 
                         oughtta be a constitutional amendment 
                         outlawing astro-turf and the 
                         designated hitter, I believe in the 
                         "sweet spot", voting every election, 
                         soft core pornography, chocolate 
                         chip cookies, opening your presents 
                         on Christmas morning rather than 
                         Christmas eve, and I believe in long, 
                         slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that 
                         last for 7 days.

                                     ANNIE
                              (breathless)
                         Oh my...
                              (softly)
                         Don't leave...

                                     CRASH
                         G'night.

               Crash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door 
               while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.

                                     EBBY
                         Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff?

               ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I 
                         want is a date. I'm not gonna fall

                         I'm not interested in a woman who's 
                         interested in that boy.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm not interested yet.

               Ebby appears in the door.

                                     EBBY
                         Who you calling a "boy"?

                                     CRASH
                         See ya at the yard, Meat.

               Crash walks out into the Durham night. Ebby and Annie stand 
               in the doorway. She speaks softly to Ebby.

                                     ANNIE
                         No ballplayer ever said "no" to a 
                         date with me.

                                     EBBY
                         Well shit, then, let's fuck.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

               ANNIE PUTS ON A RECORD -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches".

               EBBY STARTS UNDRESSING across the room.

                                     ANNIE
                         Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to 
                         watch.

               She sits in a chair. Piaf sings. Ebby practically rips his 
               shirt off, exposing a great upper body.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, no. Put it back on and take 
                         it off slowly.

                                     EBBY
                         Jesus, what kinda broad are you?

                                     ANNIE
                         When you know how to make love, you'll 
                         know how to pitch.
                              (turning to the stereo)
                         Shh. I love this part.

               Piaf sings. Annie listens. Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons 
               his shirt. It drops, revealing his back.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my -- what a nice back.

               Ebby drops his pants.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no, honey... first the shoes and 
                         socks.

                                     EBBY
                         The socks? It's cold in here.

                                     ANNIE
                              (sweetly, unthreatening)
                         You think Dwight Gooden leaves his 
                         socks on?

               Ebby considers this. Pulls his pants back up. Takes his socks 
               off. Then his pants.

                                     ANNIE
                         Ebby honey have you ever been 
                         handcuffed in bed?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

               Deserted streets of the old tobacco town. Crash walks alone.  
               He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can. He stops in 
               front of  a store window. He rolls the newspaper like a short 
               bat. He takes a batting stance, and --

               CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window, 
               studying his reflection. He taken a "swing". And another.

               A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -'CONTINUOUS NIGHT

               CLICK -- A handcuff is locked onto Ebby's wrist. Both his 
               arms are outstretched -- he's getting very excited.

                                     EBBY
                         Awright! I read about stuff like 
                         this. Bring it on!

               Annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down.

                                     ANNIE
                         Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt 
                         Whitman?

                                     EBBY
                         Who's he play for?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well, he sort of pitches for the 
                         Cosmic All-Stars.

                                     EBBY
                         Never heard of 'em.

               Annie opens a book and begins reading as Piaf sings softly.

                                     ANNIE
                         Good -- then listen.

               Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up 
               newspaper. Batting practice.

               CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense 
               concentration, endlessly working on his game.

               Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky.

                         Listen up, guys, could I have your

                         service at three in the afternoons 
                         here in the locker room and you're 
                         all invited to drop by and worship

               BOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening.

               All heads turn as:

               EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed.

                                     BOBBY
                         Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over

                         new nickname.

               Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse.

                                     DEKE
                         Annie nailed you? That's great, means 
                         you're gonna have a helluva year. 
                         Does she fuck as good as they say?

                                     EBBY
                         We didn't do it, man -- she read 
                         poetry to me all night, I swear. 
                         It's more tiring than fucking.

               EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits 
               next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby.

                                     EBBY

                         the deal here?

               Crash studies Ebby.

                         Your shower shoes have fungus on

                         shower shoes and the press'll think

               CRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field. Ebby sits silently, 
               holding his shower shoes, taking it all in.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               intensity not visible from the stands.

               CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy.

               FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat 
               boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the 
               bat with great care.

               CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself.

                         You ain't getting that cheese by me, 
                         meat.

               CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still.

                         Look for the fastball up. He's gotta

                         the hips. Relax. You're thinking too 
                         much. Get outta your fuckin' head, 
                         Crash.

                         Don't let him in your kitchen --

               THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball.

               Crash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one.

               CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs 
               it on his hands. He's pissed.

                                     CRASH (V.O.)
                         You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you 
                         swinging at a breaking ball for? 
                         Why's he starting me off with a 
                         hammer? Fuck me.

                         you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait.

               P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY.

               CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the 
               first base line. Just foul.

               Crash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the 
               plate. Picks up his bat.

                         Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese 
                         by me. One and one. You're on top. 
                         Now bring me the gas --

                P.O.V.  PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight. Right 
               at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to 
               explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH...

               CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.

               CRASH CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIRT -- Brushes himself off.

                                     CRASH
                         This son of a bitch throws hard.
                              (beat)
                         Annie, Annie, Annie -- who is this 
                         Annie?
                              (catching himself)
                         Jesus, get outta the box you idiot, 
                         where's your head? Get the broad 
                         outta your head.

               CRASH HOLDS UP HIS HAND to the ump.

                                     CRASH
                         Time out.

                                     UMP
                         Time out!

               CRASH STEPS OUT OF THE BOX -- Motions to the bat boy for the 
               pine tar rag. The boy brings it over. Crash re-applies it to 
               his bat.

                                     BAT BOY
                         Get a hit, Crash.

                                     CRASH
                         Shut up.

               CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE BOX -- Talking to himself.

                                     CRASH
                         Awright, awright. You've seen all 
                         his pitches. Two and one. Relax. 
                         Wait. Quick bat. You can hit this 
                         shit --

               CRASH IN THE BATTER'S BOX -- Digs in-again. Takes his stance.  
               Upright. Relaxed. Ready.

                                     CRASH
                         Shorten up. Bring the gas... Be quick --
                         be quick -- yeah, yeah...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE AND JACKSON IN THE STANDS -- She's writing a note 
               quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT PITCH -- A major league 
               fastball. It explodes to the plate. Crash swings. And misses. 
               Strike Three.

               CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE DUGOUT -- Head high, no show of 
               emotion. Almost proud. An old Warrior, not giving an inch 
               even in defeat.

               HE RE-ENTERS THE DUGOUT -- Sits down and starts putting the 
               catcher's gear back on. Deke leans over.

                                     DEKE
                         Serious heat, eh?

                                     CRASH
                         He ain't got shit.

               THE BATBOY TAKES THE NOTE FROM JACKSON -- And hands it to 
               Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear 
               on.

                                     BAT BOY
                         From Annie.

                                     CRASH
                         Read it.

                                     BAT BOY
                         Dear Crash. You have a lovely swing 
                         but you're pulling your hips out too 
                         early. I'd be happy to meet you at 
                         the Batting Cage tomorrow to discuss 
                         it. Signed, Annie.

                                     DEKE
                         Well if there's one chick'd know 
                         when you're pulling your hips out 
                         early, Annie's the one.

               Crash doesn't seem too amused. He grabs the note, and the 
               pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout 
               wall. He scrawls a quick note.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through 
               binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.

                                     ANNIE
                              (looking through the 
                              glasses)
                         What'd he say?

               Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads --

                                     JACKSON
                         It says... "I want to -- make... 
                         love to you. Crash".

               ANNIE PUTS DOWN THE GLASSES -- Takes the note.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. A LOCAL BATTING CAGE DAY

               ANNIE DIGS IN AT THE PLATE -- Bat in hand. Crash a few feet 
               away. Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps 
               the bat back and forth.

               THE MECHANICAL PITCHING MACHINE DELIVERS -- Kawoosh.

               ANNIE SWINGS -- Lashes out a line drive. Crash smiles.

                                     ANNIE
                         See my hips?

                                     CRASH
                         Yep.

                                     ANNIE
                         I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.

                                     CRASH
                         When you're hitting you shouldn't 
                         think about anything but hitting.
                              (beat)
                         But you shouldn't think about it too 
                         much. The trick is to use your brain 
                         to not use your brain.

                                     ANNIE
                         But you were pulling your hips last 
                         night.

                                     CRASH
                         So... Wanta make love?

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  
                         You had your chance the other night.

                                     CRASH
                         What'you see in that guy -- he's 
                         dim, pretty boy. A young, wild...

                                     ANNIE
                         Young men are uncomplicated.
                              (Crash mutters)
                         And he's not "dim". He's just 
                         inexperienced. My job is to give him 
                         "life-wisdom" and help him make it 
                         to the major leagues.

                                     CRASH
                         That's my job too.

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Damn.

                                     CRASH
                         You're pulling your hips out.

                                     ANNIE
                         But they're nice hips.
                              (beat)
                         I looked up your records -- You've 
                         hit 227 home runs in the minors.  
                         That's great!

               ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.

                                     CRASH
                         Don't tell anybody.

                                     ANNIE
                         Why not? If you hit twenty homers 
                         this year you'll be the all time 
                         minor league champ! The record's...

                                     CRASH
                         247 home runs in the minors would be 
                         a dubious honor, if ya think about 
                         it.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh no, I think it'd be great! The 
                         Sporting News should know about it.

                                     CRASH
                         No. Please.

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.

                                     ANNIE
                         Damn.

                                     CRASH
                         Let me.

               CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The 
               pitch comes. Crash drills it.

                                     CRASH
                         Your place or mine?

                                     ANNIE
                         Despite my love of weird metaphysics 
                         and my rejection of most Judao-
                         Christian ethics, I am, within the 
                         framework of a baseball season, 
                         monogamous.

                                     CRASH
                         Fact is you're afraid of meeting a 
                         guy like me 'cause it might be real 
                         so you sabotage it with some bullshit 
                         about commitment to a young boy you 
                         can boss around --
                              (whack -- a line drive)
                         Great deal. You get to write self-
                         indulgent little poems all winter 
                         about how hard it is to find a man 
                         even though you just sent him packing --
                              (whack -- a line drive)
                         So what do you really want? You wanta 
                         be a tragic woman figure wallowing 
                         in the bullshit of magic?
                              (whack -- a line drive)
                         Or do you want a guy?

               The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh Crash... you do make speeches...

               Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows.

               A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in 
               uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES.

                                     LITTLE LEAGUER #1
                         Hey, are you Crash Davis! Can I have 
                         a autograph?!

               CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers.

                                     CRASH
                              (as he signs autographs)
                         Well, Annie, your place or mine?

                                     ANNIE
                         You got me all confused.

                                     CRASH
                         A batter has two tenths of a second 
                         to decide whether to swing --

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.

                         Hey, when are you guys gonna start 
                         winning? You're terrible!

                                     ANNIE
                         It's a long season, boys.

               SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.

                                     NUKE
                         Hey!
                              (coming over)
                         What're you guys doing here -- 
                         stealing my girl?

                                     CRASH
                         Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like 
                         that?
                              (to the little leaguers)
                         Hey kids, this is the great Ebby 
                         Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.

                                     LITTLE LEAGUERS
                         It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have 
                         your autograph?! Etc.

                                     NUKE
                         No prob, kids --

               And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.  
               Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke.

                                     CRASH
                         See you guys at the ballpark.

               Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CRASH GETS INTO HIS CAR -- CONTINUOUS

               AN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a 
               couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood.

               CRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me".

               ANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY

               The sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a 
               few candles.

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes...
                              (beat)
                         Oh my...
                              (several beats)
                         Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash.

               Several beats of silence.

                                     NUKE
                         Crash?

               He flips on a lamp near the bed.

                                     NUKE
                         You mean Nuke. You said "Crash".

                                     ANNIE
                         I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke.

                                     NUKE
                         You said "Crash".

                                     ANNIE
                         Honey, don't ever listen to a woman 
                         when she's making love. They'll say 
                         the strangest things.

                                     NUKE
                         You said "Crash".

                                     ANNIE
                         Would you rather me be making love 
                         to him, using your name, or making 
                         love to you, using his name?

               Nuke considers this fabulous logic.

                                     NUKE
                         Yeah maybe you're right.

                                     ANNIE
                         You see how nice things are when we 
                         go slow?

               Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow.

                                     NUKE
                         Mmm, hmmm.
                              (beat)
                         You shoulda seen how many people 
                         came to the airport to see me off.  
                         When I got drafted first it was the 
                         happiest day of my Father's life.
                              (beat)
                         He likes baseball more than I do...

                                     ANNIE
                         You can learn to like it.

                                     NUKE
                         I wanted to be the host of Dance 
                         Fever, somethin' like that...

                                     ANNIE
                         Y'know if you make it to the Bigs 
                         you could still become the host of 
                         Dance Fever. Baseball's a good 
                         stepping stone for things like that.

                                     NUKE
                         God, I never thought of that.

                                     ANNIE
                              (sweetly)
                         There is a lot of things you never 
                         thought of, sweetie -- now get some 
                         rest for tonight's game.

               Nuke rests his head on Annie's shoulder. His eyes are wide 
               open and full of nervous energy.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               NUKE ON A PAY PHONE -- In his uniform. Players warming up in 
               the background as the ground crew prepares the field.

                                     NUKE
                         Hello? Dad? This is Ebby.

                         These hitters down here are better 
                         than the ones in high school...

                              subject)
                         How's Mom? Yeah? Well I am trying 
                         hard... I am bending my back... you're 
                         not coming down' here to visit just

                         Can I talk to Mom?

               EXT. HOME PLATE -- THE BALLPARK NIGHT

               THE MAYOR OF DURHAM AND THE CITY COUNCIL stand at a mike in 
               front of home plate. 300 LITTLE LEAGUERS in uniform are lined 
               up along the foul line, restrained by a rope.

                                     VOICE OVER P.A.
                         Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of 
                         Durham, the honorable Mutt Clark...

               THE MAYOR STEPS to the mike.  A classic Southern mayor.

                                     MAYOR

               As the honorable Mutt Clark drones on -- we INTERCUT:

               NUKE IS WARMING UP TO PITCH -- Crash and Larry watch him 
               closely, giving advice. As Nuke delivers --.

                                     CRASH
                         Drive off your back leg. You pitch 
                         with your legs as much as your arms --

                         Don't think.

               A MANGY DOG EATS FROM A DISH provided by the players. A couple 
               kids sit with the players.

               MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO A PLAYER -- BOBBY, 25.

                                     MILLIE
                         Hi, I'm Millie.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'm married.

               JOSE FASHIONS A SMALL CROSS OUT OF CHICKEN BONES and rubs it 
               on his bat. Bobby notices this.

                                     BOBBY
                         What's that?

                                     JOSE
                         Chicken bone cross take the curse 
                         off this bat and bring me hits.

                                     BOBBY
                         You a God damn witch?

                                     JOSE
                         Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very 
                         common in Puerto Rico.

                                     BOBBY
                         Will that work for me?

                                     JOSE
                         If you believe in Voodoo.

                                     BOBBY
                         I'm 0 for 16! Gimme some of that 
                         shit.

               BOBBY HOLDS OUT HIS BAT for Jose to rub with the cross.

                                     JOSE
                         No, that is not belief. That is 
                         desperation.

                                     BOBBY
                         C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!

               ALL HEADS TURN, A HELICOPTER APPEARS ABOVE THE FIELD

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing 
               from the chopper turbulence.

                                     MAYOR
                         ...five, four, three, two, one... 
                         let 'er go! One thousand big ones!

               THE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field.

               The night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED -- 
               THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to 
               the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving, 
               clawing for the cash.

               As the money flutters down...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL STADIUM -- SHORT TIME LATER

               CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up.

               Puffs of rosin "smoke". Nuke is on the mound.

               NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the 
               first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his 
               lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask 
               tipped up on his head.

                                     CRASH
                         Don't try to strike everybody out.
                              (beat)
                         Strikeouts are boring. They're 
                         Fascist. Throw some ground balls, 
                         it's more Democratic.

               CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning 
               of Nuke's interior monologue.

                                     NUKE (V.O.)
                         What's this guy know, eh? If he's so 
                         great why's he been in the minors 
                         for ten years? And if he's so hot 
                         how come Annie wants me instead of 
                         him.

               CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the 
               mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking.

                                     CRASH
                         And listen, meat. You don't know 
                         shit. If you want to get to the Show, 
                         you'll listen to me. She only wants 
                         you 'cause she can boss you around, 
                         got it?
                              (beat, complete tone 
                              change)
                         Relax, have a ball out here. This 
                         game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it.
                              (beat)
                         And don't squeeze the ball so tight. 
                         It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.

               CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate.

               NUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the 
               sign for the pitch.

                                     NUKE
                         Fun? What's he know about fun?
                              (beat)
                         Why's he calling for a curveball? I 
                         wanta bring heat.

                                     CRASH
                         Shake off the pitch. Throw what you 
                         wanta.

               NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to 
               the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch.

                                     CRASH
                         Why you shaking me off?

                                     NUKE
                         I wanta throw the heater to announce 
                         my presence with authority.

                                     CRASH
                         "To announce your fucking presence 
                         with authority"? This guy's a first 
                         ball fastball hitter. He's looking 
                         for heat.

                                     NUKE
                         But he ain't seen my heat --

                                     CRASH
                         Awright, meat, give him your heat.

               CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate.

               CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the 
               opposing leadoff batter.

                                     CRASH
                         Fastball.

                         Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm 
                         the guy driving a Porsche.

               NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball.

               THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line 
               shot over the right field fence.

               CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home 
               run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump.

               The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS.

               THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the 
               shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly -- 
               and gets very tough.

                                     CRASH
                         What're you lookin' at?! You're 
                         showing up my pitcher, bush -- get 
                         your ass in gear!

               THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.

               AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing 
               Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles.

                                     CRASH
                         Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?

                         fastball.

                                     CRASH
                         He did know.

                         I told him.

               CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate.

               NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath.

                         Just throw.

               NUKE'S WINDUP AND DELIVERY -- A fastball. A powerful, clean, 
               overwhelming fastball. Strike one.

               THE BULL MASCOT DIVES FOR COVER -- The ball hits the bat 
               rack. Bats go flying.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE STADIUM -- NIGHT

               THE PLAYERS EXIT -- The Groupies wait in a cluster. The wives 
               wait in another group. Bobby's wife sees Bobby.

                                     BOBBY'S WIFE
                              (to child)
                         There's Daddy! Wave to Daddy!

               -- P.O.V. BOBBY COMING OUT OF THE CLUBHOUSE -- Another player 
               has his arm around Bobby, consoling him. The wife knows.

                                     BOBBY'S WIFE
                         Oh God...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN

               THE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy 
               players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends.

               ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls 
               something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of 
               WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills.

                                     ANNIE
                         I want you to wear these on the road 
                         trip when you pitch.

                                     NUKE
                         What?

                                     ANNIE
                         They'll fit snugly against your balls 
                         in such a wonderful way that you'll 
                         start seeing things differently --
                         plus they'll remind you of me which 
                         is better than thinking about those 
                         nasty hitters.

                                     NUKE
                         Jesus, Annie, I don't know --

                                     ANNIE
                         You've been pitching out of the wrong 
                         side of your brain. These'll help 
                         move things to the right side.

                                     NUKE
                         Big League pitchers don't use these.

                                     ANNIE
                         They did when they were in the 
                         Carolina League.

               NUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small 
               kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LOCKER ROOM -- DAWN

               PLAYERS THROW THEIR GEAR into their travel bags.

               A PAPER BEER CUP IS TAPED TO THE WALL -- With a sign:

               "Married men deposit wedding rings here for road trips".

               CLOSE ON THE CUP -- A ring is dropped in, and another, and...

               We begin hearing Annie's VOICE OVER:

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         A woman should never ask questions 
                         about road trips.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE PARKING LOT -- DAWN

               THE TEAM BUS PULLS OUT -- Wives and girlfriends head back to 
               their apartments, leaving:

               ANNIE WALKING BACK ROME -- Several blocks to her house.

                                     ANNIE
                         Men don't realize that women always 
                         know when they've been unfaithful.
                              (beat)
                         The fact is, upon exact moment of 
                         penetration -- the woman knows.

               AS ANNIE WALKS BACK through Durham...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY THROUGH THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS - EARLY MORNING

               THE TEAM BUS ROLLS through the North Carolina landscape.

                                     ANNIE
                         This sort of spiritual awareness can 
                         be a mixed blessing, especially if 
                         you're dating a ballplayer. I believe 
                         a woman oughta take care of her man 
                         so thoroughly that he can go on the 
                         road for a few days without having 
                         the desire to search out another 
                         pair of panties
                              (self-aware)
                         That is probably, however, my most 
                         ridiculous belief.
                              (sigh)
                         I just hope the boys start winning 
                         soon. In some profound way I fear 
                         that a last place team is a reflection 
                         on its women...

               THE BUS ROLLS through North Carolina.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE BUS -- MORNING

               SKIP SITS IN THE FRONT of the bus, doing a crossword puzzle.

               LARRY READS A BOOK -- "How to Make a Million Dollars in Real 
               Estate with No Money Down".

               DEKE TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK -- George Jones sings "He Stopped 
               Loving Her Today".

               MICKEY TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK across the aisle -- Aretha 
               Franklin sings "R-E-S-P-E-C-T".

               DEKE TURNS HIS VOLUME LOUDER -- Mickey does likewise, and 
               soon we have DUELING TAPE DECKS. C & W going head to head 
               with R & B. A cacophony.

               SKIP LEAPS TO HIS FEET, WHIRLS and shouts.

                                     SKIP
                         I got one word to say to you -- Shut 
                         up!

               Silence.

               And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but 
               slightly dissonant guitar chords.

               THE BACK OF THE BUS -- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash, 
               who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon. Nuke has a guitar and is 
               struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness".  
               He butchers the chords and the words.

                                     NUKE
                              (singing softly)
                         Oh she may get wooly, women do get 
                         wooly, because of all the stress...

                                     CRASH
                              (in disgust)
                         Gimme that.

               CRASH STRONGARMS THE GUITAR from Nuke.

                                     CRASH
                         I hate people who get the words wrong.  
                         It ain't "woolly" it's "weary" and 
                         it nobody's got stress, they're 
                         wearing a dress.
                              (beat)
                         Listen.

               CRASH WHIPS THROUGH THE FIRST FEW BARS of the song.

                                     CRASH
                              (sings softly)
                         Oh she may be weary, Young girls do 
                         get weary, Wearing the same old 
                         dress...

               HE SHOVES THE GUITAR back at Nuke.

                                     NUKE
                         How come you don't like me?

                                     CRASH
                         'Cause you don't respect yourself, 
                         which is your problem, but you don't 
                         respect the game -- and that's my 
                         problem.
                              (beat)
                         You got a gift.

                                     NUKE
                         What do I got?

                                     CRASH
                         A gift. When you were a baby the 
                         gods reached down and turned your 
                         left arm into a thunderbolt.

               Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously.

                                     CRASH
                         You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're 
                         pissing it away.

                                     NUKE
                         I ain't pissing nothing away -- I 
                         got a Porsche already. A 944 with 
                         A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.

                                     CRASH
                         You don't need a quadraphonic 
                         Blaupunkt -- you need a curve ball.
                              (beat)
                         In the Show, everybody can hit the 
                         fastball.

                                     NUKE
                         You been in the Majors?

                                     CRASH
                         Yep.

               Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around. And Crash gets 
               wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful.

                                     CRASH
                         I was in the Show for 21 days, once.
                              (beat)
                         It was the greatest 21 days of my 
                         life. You never touch your luggage 
                         in the show -- somebody else handles 
                         your bags. It's great.
                              (beat)
                         The ballparks are like cathedrals, 
                         the hotels all have room service, 
                         the women have long legs and brains -- 
                         it's a smorgasbord.

                                     DEKE
                         The women are hot, eh?

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. 
                         They throw ungodly breaking stuff in 
                         the Show -- exploding sliders.

               Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement.

                                     CRASH
                         You could be one of those guys -- 
                         but you don't give a fuck, Meat.

                                     NUKE
                         God damn it I'm sick of you calling 
                         me "Meat"! You wanta step outside!

               CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing 
               Nuke by the collar.

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah, let's go.

               Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying.

                                     NUKE
                         No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash...

               Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting 
               nearby. He hands the ball to Crash.

                                     NUKE
                         Teach me how to throw a breaking 
                         ball.

               Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly:

                                     CRASH
                         As I was saying ya hold it like an 
                         egg.

               As the bus rolls through the country:

               A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the 
               wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks.

               The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You 
               See"

               And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape...

               Hit Hank Williams music to play over:

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WINSTON-SALEM BASEBALL STADIUM -- DAY

               MAX PATKIN COACHES THIRD in his comic routine, now, for the 
               Winston-Salem team, as Durham is in the field.

               A WINSTON-SALEM BATTER lines a double off the wall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DURHAM RADIO STATION -- DAY

               TEDDY THE ANNOUNCER re-creates the game for broadcast with a 
               several second delay.

               HIS ASSISTANT (P.A. ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone 
               to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, 
               holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON 
               THE AIR "play by play".

               CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT".

               TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of 
               ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes 
               cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at 
               his fingertips.

                                     TEDDY
                              (on the air)
                         ...double off the wall by Higgins, 
                         and once again the Durham pitchers

               THE WIVES AND SOME GIRLFRIENDS WATCH "DYNASTY" on Annie's 
               television. Annie hosts, filling their drink glasses, serving 
               popcorn, and largely staying in the background.

                         Do you think your husband plays around 
                         on the road trips?

                         I guess not... it's just that once I 
                         asked Mickey if he was faithful to 
                         me on the road trips and he said "in 
                         his heart he was faithful".

                         It means he's unfaithful -- but only 
                         a man would put it in those words.

               A BABY CRIES -- Tommy's Wife lifts a baby from the couch,

                                     ANNIE
                         What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You 
                         only talk about yourself? Aren't you 
                         glad to see me? Don't I look nice?

                                     NUKE
                         Sorry. You look great. I'm totally 
                         exhausted.

                                     ANNIE
                         Good. Total exhaustion can be 
                         spiritually fabulous.

                         Let's play catch.

                                     NUKE
                         Catch?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S BACKYARD -- MORNING

               Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere. And, 60 feet away in 
               complete, oversized catcher's gear --

               JACKSON IN A CATCHER'S CROUCH -- Nuke stares, in his street 
               clothes, but now with a glove and ball.

                                     JACKSON
                         Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in 
                         here, hum babe--

                                     ANNIE
                         That's not necessary, Jackson --
                              (beat)
                         Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.

               He does. Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.

                                     NUKE
                         This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.

                                     ANNIE
                         Just do what I say. Now, which nostril 
                         are you breathing through?

                                     NUKE
                         Which nostril am I breathing through?

               Annie puts her hand under his nose.

                                     ANNIE
                         The right nostril. Good.

                                     NUKE
                         My right nostril?

                                     ANNIE
                         There are two important psychic 
                         conduits called the "pingala" and 
                         the "ida". The pingala starts with 
                         the left testicle (or left ovary of 
                         the female) and ends at the right 
                         nostril.

               She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of 
               fact manner. He stares back.

                                     ANNIE
                         The ida originates at the right 
                         testicle (or ovary) and terminates 
                         at the left nostril.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm really beat. I need some serious 
                         "z's" --

                                     ANNIE
                         The pingala is the nostril used for 
                         throwing a baseball.
                              (beat)
                         And if you discover before a game 
                         you're in the wrong nostril, it's 
                         easy to switch.

                                     NUKE
                         Switch nostrils?

                                     ANNIE
                         Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.

               NUKE TOSSES AN EASY PITCH to Jackson. Annie's incensed.

                                     ANNIE
                         You're patronizing me! I will not be 
                         patronized --

                                     NUKE
                         If I throw too hard I'll hurt the 
                         kid.

                                     ANNIE
                         He's handled a lotta pitchers whose 
                         records were better than one and 
                         six.

               Nuke gets a little steamed. He feels his nostril, winds, and 
               fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson.

                                     NUKE
                              (a bit angry)
                         How was that?

                                     ANNIE
                         A little better.

                                     NUKE
                         Gimme the God damn ball!

               NUKE WINDS UP and fires a pitch to Jackson. Alas --

               THE BALL SAILS THROUGH A WINDOW -- Crashing glass.

                                     NUKE
                              (cynically)
                         How ya like that?

                                     ANNIE
                         Much better. Your delivery was fully 
                         integrated because you weren't 
                         thinking about it 'cause you were 
                         pissed off at me.
                              (beat)
                         This is progress.

               Nuke smiles and gives in. And reaches for her.

                                     NUKE
                         I give up. Let's go inside, make 
                         love, and fall asleep till it's time 
                         to go to the ballpark.

               She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.

                                     ANNIE
                         Or...
                              (taking his hand)
                         ...We could just take that sexual 
                         energy and save it for a few hours 
                         and re-channel it into your pitching 
                         tonight.
                              (shouting)
                         C'mon, Jackson, I've got some 
                         lemonade!

               Jackson runs over in full gear to join them.

               SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH -- A pitcher of lemonade.

                                     NUKE
                         I can't keep up with you. First you 
                         say sex is gonna make me a better 
                         pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do 
                         it?!

                                     ANNIE
                         It's all the same thing.

               SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.

                                     NUKE
                         What's that?!

               -- P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in 
               larged letters on the side are the words "MAX PATKIN".

                                     ANNIE
                              (matter of factly)
                         That's Max. His ashes anyway. He 
                         left no kin...

               Nuke stares, unsettled.

                                     NUKE
                         God... I think I'm gonna be sick --

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing 
                         to be scared of. It's just another 
                         way of living. It's just a fresh 
                         start -- kinda like spring training.

               Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at 
               Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.

                                     NUKE
                         Death is like spring training?

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in 
                         the eyes, Nuke --
                              (sweetly accusing him)
                         You haven't been wearing my panties, 
                         have you?

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

               NUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties.

               Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband.

                                     CRASH
                         Hot. Very hot...

               Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly.

                                     NUKE
                         Annie says her panties will keep one 
                         side of my brain occupied while I'm 
                         on the mound, thus keeping my brain 
                         slightly off center, which is where 
                         it should be for artists and pitchers. 
                         She also said I should throw whatever 
                         pitches you call for.

                                     CRASH
                         Annie's a smart lady.

               Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties.

                                     DEKE
                         Hey, fruit alert! Check out the Rook.

               SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke 
               as the players are dressing into their uniforms.

                                     NUKE
                         Annie says there's no such thing as 
                         straight and gay. We're all sexual 
                         creatures to start with, and we get 
                         formed into certain roles.

                                     TOMMY
                         You believe that?

                                     NUKE
                         When I'm one and six I'll believe 
                         anything.
                              (as they dress)
                         Annie also says that God is a woman.  
                         You believe that, Crash, you think 
                         God's a lady?

                                     CRASH
                         God's definitely a woman -- but she's 
                         no lady.

                                     TOMMY
                         This is all Commie bullshit.
                              (beat)
                         God has a dick, man.

                                     TONY
                         God damn it, Jimmy, you're an expert -- 
                         does God have a dick or a pussy?

               JIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological 
               question.  Ll heads wait for the answer.

                                     JIMMY
                         The Lord God is tri-une -- Father, 
                         Son, and Holy Ghost.

                                     TOMMY
                         Father and Son. Awright!

               The guys slap fives, convinced God is a man.

                                     MICKEY
                              (baiting them)
                         Yeah, but He is a brother.

                                     TOMMY
                         Bullshit! God ain't no brother!

               Deke turns to Crash, full of despair.

                                     DEKE
                         If there is a God, why am I hitting 
                         .200?

               SUDDENLY SKIP AND LARRY APPEAR to restore order.

                                     SKIP
                         Shut up! This is a damn noisy 
                         clubhouse for a team that's lost 15 
                         straight.

               Silence.

               Skip takes off his cap -- instantly sincere.

                                     SKIP
                         Patkin was a tribute to baseball...

               EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- DUSK

               A BLACK GOSPEL GROUP at a mike at home plate, singing:

                                     GOSPEL SINGER
                              (singing)
                         I come to the garden alone, When the 
                         dew is still on the roses, And the 
                         voice I hear, whispering in my ear,.

               ANNIE SPRINKLES MAX'S ASHES on the pitcher's mound, as:

               JACKSON SITS IN THE DUGOUT FILLING ROSIN BAGS with the extra 
               ashes from a box.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- A ROSIN BAG MARKED "MAX"

               EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT

               NUKE ON THE MOUND -- PICKS UP the rosin bag, and paces. A 
               small crowd. A batter steps in to hit. Nuke looks in for the 
               sign.

                         He looks wonderful, Jackson...

                         Fastball again? Why's he want the

                         think, Meat -- give 'em the gas.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- An eye-popping fastball. The batter 
               swings and misses. Strike three.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I heard he's wearing women's underwear -- 
                         and he's breathing through his pingala

                         I'm getting too old for this game.

                P.O.V. NUKES FASTBALL SHATTERS A BAT -- THE HITTER hits a 
               weak roller to third for the second out.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         of the mysteries of sex I guess...

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS A VICIOUS CURVEBALL -- A check swing 
               dribbler to first for the third out. And the players run 
               into the dugout.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE DUGOUT

               NUKE PUTS ON HIS WARM UP JACKET and sits down next to Crash, 
               who's taking off his gear, readying to hit.

                                     NUKE
                         I was great, eh?

                         Your fastball was up and your 
                         curveball was hanging -- in the Show 
                         they woulda ripped you.

                         The moment's over.
                              (rising to get a bat)
                         If this guy starts me off with a 
                         breaking ball, I'm going downtown --

               CRASH SMILES in his disarming way, and grabs a bat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ON DECK CIRCLE

               Crash kneels, rubbing the bat handle with pine tar. He studies 
               the pitcher working the first two hitters.

               CRASH RISES and heads to the plate.

               CRASH STEPS INTO THE BOX -- Digs in.

                                     CRASH
                         I dare you to throw me the hammer -- 
                         you ain't that stupid...

               CRASH'S P.O.V. IN SLOW-MOTION -- The pitcher winds and 
               delivers. And as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand--

                                     CRASH
                         Breaking ball -- you fool!

               CRASH UNLOADS ON THE PITCH -- Crushing a home run deep over 
               the left field wall.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               say "What's happening?" Larry just shrugs.

               BACK TO THE FIELD -- Nuke's next pitch.

               THE NEXT BATTER POPS UP -- Crash circles into foul ground to 
               make the catch, whipping the ball around the infield.

               AND CRASH GOES TO THE MOUND for a visit.

               THE BATTER STEPS OUT OF THE BOX nervously, muttering.

               THE BATTER SWINGS TERRIBLY OFF STRIDE -- Strike three. Crash 
               whips the ball around the infield.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- A hanging curveball. The batter 
               takes an ungodly cut, and BLASTS a long home.

               THE BATTER STANDS AT THE PLATE watching the blast... until 
               CRASH SHOVES HIM toward first with a sneer. For a moment it 
               looks like there'll be a fight -- but the hitter backs off 
               and takes the home run trot as:

               NUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the 
               bases. Crash walks to the mound.

                                     NUKE
                         You told him I was throwing a deuce, 
                         right?

                                     CRASH
                         Yep. He really crushed that dinger, 
                         didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... 
                         damn...

               NUKE HOLDS OUT HIS GLOVE -- Says nothing. Crash puts a new 
               ball in the glove. Returns to the plate.

               NUKE GETS THE SIGN -- Winds. Delivers. Batter hits a weak 
               one hopper back to the mound. Game's over.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         works for one game, maybe it'll work 
                         for a whole buncha games.

                                     ANNIE
                         Breathing through your pingala always 
                         works, honey --

                                     NUKE
                         Not that. I mean the re-channeling 
                         of my sexual energy.
                              (beat)
                         Maybe we shouldn't make love for 
                         awhile.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now don't go overboard, I look 
                         incredibly hot, right?

               She strikes a pose. She does look hot.

                                     NUKE
                         You know what it feels like to throw 
                         a three hitter?
                              (nervously, with 
                              resolve)
                         We better not fuck.

                                     ANNIE
                         Nuke?!

                                     NUKE
                         Just till I lose.

                                     ANNIE
                         Get over here.

                                     NUKE
                         No.

                                     ANNIE
                         Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh --

               She starts toward him -- and Nuke flees. Out the door, into 
               the night. Annie slumps in disbelief.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

               ANNIE SITS IN BED ALONE -- Lights a cigarette. A puzzled 
               expression -- things have got out of control.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Nuke was so encouraged that he took 
                         a vow to not have sex until they 
                         lost...

               Annie reaches over, opens a drawer in her nightstand, and 
               pulls out her baseball glove. She cradles it fondly in her 
               lap, puts it on, pounds it gently...

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Y'see a ballplayer on a streak 
                         considers himself touched with magic 
                         and he'll do anything to keep from 
                         breaking the spell...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. DURHAM BULL LOCKER ROOM -- DAY

               NUKE NEATLY UNFOLDS THE RED PANTIES in his locker.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         In fact the whole team started making 
                         religious connections and everybody 
                         got hot.

               JOSE BLESSES THE BATS with a chicken bone cross.

               JIMMY READS THE BIBLE and prays alone in the corner.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL FIELD -- DAY

               PLAYERS TAKING GROUND BALLS and batting practice.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I figured Nuke would win a couple, 
                         then lose, and things would get back 
                         to normal...

               PLAYERS PLAYING "FLIP" PEPPER like kids.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         But it didn't happen like that... 
                         and for one extraordinary June and 
                         July, the Durham Bulls, for whatever 
                         perverse reason, began playing 
                         baseball with joy and verve and poetry --

               NUKE WARMING UP in the bullpen, listening to Crash.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The two sides of my own brain were 
                         all jumbled up and cross-wired...  
                         while one side was being neglected, 
                         the other was in paradise watching 
                         our Bulls play like Big Leaguers...

               MICKEY RIPS A TRIPLE UP THE ALLEY -- Slides into third.

               DEKE AND TOMMY TURN A SPECTACULAR DOUBLE PLAY

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         We swept a four game series with 
                         Kingston, back to back doubleheaders 
                         with Winston-Salem, and kicked the 
                         holy shit out of Greensboro in a 
                         three game series...

               SEVERAL PLAYERS SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS at a local mall. A line 
               of kids to meet them. A banner -- MEET YOUR BULLS!

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         They were in demand all over town -- 
                         and Crash, who kept hitting dingers, 
                         was approaching the minor league 
                         record... though I told nobody.

               CRASH BLASTS ANOTHER HOME RUN -- Another win.

               JULY 4 PROMOTION -- LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY, AND JOSE dressed as 
               the "Spirit of 176 Drum and Fife Corps" at home plate, 
               surrounded by a Boy Scout Troop.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader, 
                         the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

               THE WIVES, THE GROUPIES, AND MILLIE WAIT for the players 
               outside the clubhouse following a game.

               ANNIE SITS ALONE IN HER BOX SEAT as the stadium empties.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         But beautiful as the winning streak 
                         was, I was getting damn lonely.
                              (beat)
                         Something had to be done. I needed a 
                         man...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE TEAM BUS ON THE ROAD BACK --DAY

               The sounds of Diana Ross and the Supremes.

               INT. THE BUS -- DAY

               LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY AND MICKEY as the Supremes, singing "Stop 
               in the Name of Love" at the front of the bus.

                                     NUKE
                         I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  
                         I love it. Teach me everything.

                                     CRASH
                         It's time you started working on 
                         your interviews.

                                     NUKE
                         What do I gotta do?

                                     CRASH
                         Learn your clichés. Study them. Know 
                         them. They're your friends.

               Crash hands Nuke a small pad and pen.

                                     CRASH
                         Write this down.

                         "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."

                         Boring.

                                     CRASH
                         Of course. That's the point.
                              (beat)
                         "I'm just happy to be here and hope 
                         I can help the ballclub."

                         Write, write -- "I just wanta give 
                         It my best shot and, Good Lord 
                         willing, things'll work out."

               NUKE STARTS WRITING them down.

                                     NUKE
                         "...Good Lord willing, things'll

                         Yep. So how's Annie?

               Nuke looks up from his clichés, startled.

                                     NUKE
                         She's getting steamed 'cause I'm 
                         still re-channeling my sexual energy -- 
                         maybe I should cave in and sleep 
                         with her once just to calm her down.  
                         What'ya think?

                                     CRASH
                         You outta your mind? If you give in 
                         now you might start losing.
                              (beat)
                         Never fuck with a winning streak.

               Nuke nods seriously, listening to the master.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAY

               THE BUS PULLS IN -- Wives and girlfriends are waiting.

               The players get off, greet their women.

               ANNIE GREETS NUKE -- They head for her Volvo..

               JIMMY STARTS ACROSS THE LOT on foot, dragging his luggage, 
               when Millie pulls up in her car.

                                     MILLIE
                         Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride?

                              (nervously)

                         No.

                         Can I give you my testimony?

                                     MILLIE
                         You can do anything you want.
                              (a tiny grin)
                         Hop in.

               JIMMY NERVOUSLY GETS IN WITH MILLIE They roar away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

               NUKE SITS AT THE TABLE -- He's just finished eating.

               Annie circles him. A pot of soup on the stove.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  
                         Want some more soup?

                                     NUKE
                         No, no, it was great.

                                     ANNIE
                         How 'bout a back rub?

                                     NUKE
                         No, that's okay. All I need's a little 
                         nap.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'll tuck you in.

                                     NUKE
                              (nervously)
                         You can't seduce me.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm not gonna try to seduce you, 
                         sweetie...

               ANNIE STRETCHES OUT HER LEG and lays it an the table.

                                     NUKE
                         What's that?

               She pulls back her skirt slightly, exposing her garter snaps 
               attached to her stockings.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's my leg.

                                     NUKE
                         I know what it is.

                                     ANNIE
                         I figure we could work on some 
                         fundamentals even if we don't make 
                         love.

               She strokes her leg. Nuke stares fearfully.

                                     NUKE
                         Fundamentals?

                                     ANNIE
                         Sure.
                              (beat)
                         Unsnap my stockings.

               Nuke squirms, then reaches for her garter snaps. And stops.

                                     NUKE
                         Crash once called a woman's, uh -- 
                         pussy -- y'know how the hair kinda 
                         makes a "V" shape? --

                                     ANNIE
                         Yes I do...

                                     NUKE
                         Well -- he calls it the Bermuda 
                         Triangle. He said a man can get lost 
                         in there and never be heard from 
                         again.

                                     ANNIE
                         What a nasty thing to say.

                                     NUKE
                         He didn't mean it nasty. He said 
                         that gettin' lost and disappearing 
                         from the face of the earth was 
                         sometimes a good thing to do -- 
                         especially like that.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh...
                              (beat)
                         Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, 
                         honey, give it a try.

               NUKE REACHES FOR THE GARTER SNAPS with two hands. He fumbles, 
               groping awkwardly. Annie stops him gently.

                                     ANNIE
                         Watch... one hand --

               WITH A SINGLE HAND ANNIE FLICKS each snap. Flick, flick, 
               flick. Magic. The snaps open effortlessly.

                                     NUKE
                         oh.

               ANNIE RE-SNAPS THEM QUICKLY, offering her leg to Nuke.

                                     ANNIE
                         Now you try.

               NUKE TRIES AGAIN -- One handed. Awkwardly again, but --

                                     ANNIE
                              (sighing sexually)
                         Mmmmmmm... oh yes...

               BUT NUKE LEAPS TO HIS FEET -- Reacting vigorously, nervously, 
               desperately. The soup crashes on the floor.

                                     NUKE
                         No! You're playing with my mind!

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm trying to play with your body!

                                     NUKE
                         I knew it -- you're seducing me!

                                     ANNIE
                         Of course I'm seducing you for 
                         Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor 
                         job of it --
                              (beat)
                         Aren't I pretty?

                                     NUKE
                         I think you're real cute.

                                     ANNIE
                         Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are 
                         cute! I wanta be exotic and 
                         mysterious!

                                     NUKE
                         You're exotic and mysterious and 
                         cute -- that's why I better leave.

               Nuke starts to leave.

                                     ANNIE
                         Nuke! You got things all wrong! 
                         There's no relation between sex and 
                         baseball. Ask Crash.

                                     NUKE
                         I did.

                                     ANNIE
                         What'd he say?

                                     NUKE
                         He said if I gave in to you I'd start 
                         losing again.

                                     ANNIE
                         He did?

                                     NUKE
                         I'll be back when we lose.

               NUKE HURRIES OUT THE DOOR -- Annie just stares.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- DURHAM -- DAY

               A run of the mill cheap modern motel.

               INT. CRASH'S ROOM AT THE MOTEL -- DAY

               CRASH WORKS ON HIS SWING in front of a mirror.

               A knock at the door.

                                     CRASH
                         Come in.

               ANNIE ENTERS the room. Crash stays with his stance.

                                     ANNIE
                         Crash... I want you.

                                     CRASH
                         Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?

                                     ANNIE
                         He's confused --

                                     CRASH
                         Aren't we all?

                                     ANNIE
                         Don't you think I'm pretty?

               Crash puts down the bat, and looks directly at her. As he 
               does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins 
               pumping them an he talks.

                                     CRASH
                         You're gorgeous, God damn it! From 
                         the moment I first saw you I knew I 
                         had to have you. I had to have you!

                                     ANNIE
                         I want to be had.

                                     CRASH
                         I think of you and the "boy" all the 
                         time.

                                     ANNIE
                         He won't make love to me anymore.

                                     CRASH
                         And he's right! A ballplayer on a 
                         streak has to respect the streak. 
                         They don't happen very often.
                              (beat)
                         You know how hard this game is? If 
                         you believe you're playing well 
                         because you're getting laid or because 
                         you're not getting laid or because 
                         you wore red silk panties -- then 
                         you are!
                              (beat)
                         And I still think Thomas Pynchon is 
                         full of shit.

                                     ANNIE
                         I want you desperately!

               Crash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down --

                                     CRASH
                         Who are you? Do you have a job?

                                     ANNIE
                         I teach part time at the Junior 
                         College. What if I told you I was 
                         through with Nuke? He learned his 
                         lessons quickly and left me.

                                     CRASH
                         And now you wanta teach me?

                                     ANNIE
                         I don't imagine there's much I could 
                         teach you.

                                     CRASH
                         I doubt that.

                                     ANNIE
                         Crash, I get wet just thinking about 
                         you.

                                     CRASH
                         I thought you wanted an 
                         "uncomplicated" boy?

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm ready for a complicated man.

                                     CRASH
                         -- and as soon as we lose a game, 
                         he'll be back in your arms.

                                     ANNIE
                         I said when I think about you, I get 
                         wet.

                                     CRASH
                         Annie, I think you should leave.

               Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self- 
               awareness. She's frustrated, confused, angry and...

                                     ANNIE
                         God damn you -- what is happening? 
                         Is there no man who'll have me?
                              (beat)
                         This is the weirdest season I ever 
                         saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose 
                         and I can't get laid!

                                     CRASH
                              (softly)
                         You okay?

               Annie slides against the wall down to the floor. Tears flow. 
               Her makeup runs. Her eyes are red.

                                     ANNIE
                              (shakily)
                         I need a drink.

               Crash gingerly helps her to her feet.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- DAY

               ANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar.

                                     CRASH
                         Why baseball?

                                     ANNIE
                              (sighs)
                         I was raised in a Baptist church got 
                         dipped in the water when I was 5 -- 
                         born again before kindergarten... by 
                         the time I was 10 I knew it was 
                         bullshit and at 15 I ran away from 
                         home...

               SHE SMILES at the most painful memories.

                                     ANNIE
                         pregnant, had an abortion, got 
                         pregnant again, had an abortion 
                         again... gave up men. Tried women. 
                         Missed men. My mother died.
                              (beat)
                         I bought a car for $200 and drove to 
                         Ft. Lauderdale to bury her.
                              (beat)
                         And after we'd sung some hymns in 
                         some wretched Florida funeral home, 
                         I went outside and something happened --

               Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic.

                                     ANNIE
                         The smell of cut grass in the warm 
                         March air overwhelmed me and I heard 
                         a noise --
                              (makes the sound))
                         -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men 
                         shouting... then tok, tok, tok.

               Crash smiles slightly. He knows.

                                     ANNIE
                         I crossed the street -- it was the 
                         New York Yankees spring training 
                         field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound 
                         of a ball hitting a bat -- and I sat 
                         in the warm bleachers to think about 
                         my mother...
                              (beat)
                         And I saw him.

                                     CRASH
                         Who?

                                     ANNIE
                         Thurman Munson.
                              (beat)
                         He was covered with dirt and he was 
                         fighting with everybody -- it was 
                         beautiful...
                              (beat)
                         And he called the ump a cocksucker 
                         and got thrown out of the game even 
                         though it was an exhibition!
                              (beat)
                         So I stayed in the bleachers all 
                         spring and gradually came to 
                         understand what's so great about 
                         baseball.

                         What's so great about baseball?

                                     ANNIE
                         If you know where home plate is, 
                         then you know where 1st base is, and 
                         2nd, and everything else -- 'cause 
                         they're always in the same place in 
                         relation to home.
                              (beat)
                         Don't you see? If you know where 
                         home plate is, then you know where 
                         everything else in the universe is!

               Silence.

                                     CRASH
                         I don't know if I'd go that far.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's true, It's true!
                              (beat, down)
                         Least it used to be true. It ain't 
                         possible that baseball's not enough 
                         anymore, is it, Crash?

                                     CRASH
                         It's possible.

                                     ANNIE
                         No.

                                     CRASH
                         Are you gonna be waking up next to 
                         20 year old ballplayers when you're 
                         60?

                                     ANNIE
                         Well... I used to think that wasn't 
                         the worst thing in the world to look 
                         forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.

                                     CRASH
                         Why not?

                                     ANNIE
                              (angrily)
                         Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you 
                         gonna play forever?!

               Before Crash can answer --

               SUDDENLY A VOICE interrupts. They both turn to see:

               MILLIE EXCITEDLY DRAGGING JIMMY into the nearly empty bar.

               She leads him by the hand.

                                     MILLIE
                         Annie, Annie! There she is -- we've 
                         been looking all over for ya. Hi 
                         Crash.

               MILLIE LEADS JIMMY right up to their table. And as they hold 
               hands. Jimmy stands there shyly.

                                     MILLIE
                         Well tell 'em, honey.

                                     JIMMY
                              (nervously)
                         We're getting married.

               MILLIE STICKS OUT HER LEFT HAND Displays a huge ring.

                                     ANNIE
                         Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for 
                         you.

                                     MILLIE
                         He's a virgin.

               Jimmy squirms defensively.

                                     JIMMY
                         Well, yeah...
                              (to Annie and Crash)
                         I guess that probably seems pretty 
                         corny to people like you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh Jimmy, honey, I think it sounds 
                         wonderful!

                                     MILLIE
                         Annie, will you be the bride's maid?

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         look loose. Anything bothering him?

                                     LARRY
                         He said his chakras were jammed and 
                         he was breathing out of the wrong 
                         nostril.

                              (spitting tobacco)
                         Okay...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK TO THE MOUND

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS AGAIN -- Very high. Ball four.

               CRASH IS QUICKLY to the mound.

                         What's wrong?

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE NIGHT

               ANNIE IS HELPING MILLIE make her WEDDING DRESS.

               The game can be heard on the radio in the b.g.

                                     MILLIE
                         You should be at the game.

                                     ANNIE
                         No, no -- I'm fine. Millie, how much 
                         time did you and Jimmy spend together 
                         before he proposed?

               Annie holds the dress up to Millie.

                                     MILLIE
                         Five hours. We both just know.
                              (studying the dress)
                         Do you think I deserve to wear white?

                         We all deserve to wear white.

               BOTH WOMEN TURN THEIR HEADS to the radio to listen.

               EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK THE GAME NIGHT

               CRASH FLIPS HIS MASK -- A runner rounds third heading for 
               home. Here comes the throw, on a line. It hits once on the 
               infield grass, takes a long hop --

               AS THE RUNNER BARRELS TOWARD THE PLATE -- Crash takes the 
               throw.

               THE RUNNER SLIDES -- Crash blocks the plate. A cloud of dust. 
               A close play.

               THE UMPIRE SIGNALS "SAFE" -- And Crash flips out. In a second 
               he is nose to nose with the UMPIRE.

                                     CRASH
                         You're a cocksucker!

                         You're outta here!

               THE UMP THEATRICALLY THROWS CRASH out of the game.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         ...I've never seen Crash so angry 
                         and frankly, Bull fans, he used a 
                         certain word that's a "no-no" with 
                         umpires...

                         Crash musta called the guy a 
                         cocksucker

               INT. THE SHOWERS NIGHT

               CRASH STANDS AGAINST the water, letting it stream across 
               him. He raises a can of beer to his lips, drinks it slowly 
               in the shower.

               As the water runs over Crash...

                                     ANNIE
                         When Crash got throwed out, the game 
                         got out of hand...
                              (beat)
                         ...Jose made three errors with his

                         Nuke never quite got in the groove 
                         though he didn't pitch bad...

               NUKE JUST MISSES WITH A PITCH -- Ball four.

                         ...and the winning streak came to an 
                         end with a 3-2 loss...
                              (beat)
                         The good news was that a man was 
                         about to come calling... the bad 
                         news was -- it was the wrong guy.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM NIGHT

               AS PIAF PLAYS on the stereo -- A knock at the door.

               ANNIE GOES TO THE DOOR -- Then refuses to answer it at first.  
               She hides in a corner. Bites her fist.

                                     NUKE'S VOICE
                         Annie! You gotta be in there -- I 
                         can hear that crazy Mexican singer!

               Annie smiles slightly, and opens the door.

                                     NUKE
                         We lost.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's okay...

               She opens the door fully. Nuke's father stands there.

                                     NUKE
                         I'd like you to meet my father.

                                     ANNIE
                              (surprised)
                         Oh -- won't YOU come in?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE

               AS THEY ENTER -- She leads them into the kitchen.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         Ebby's told me a lot about you.

                                     ANNIE
                         Uh oh...
                              (beat)
                         Can I offer you some coffee?

               THE KITCHEN -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

               She puts a pot of water with a swirl of graciousness.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         Yeah... Ebby tells me you're a very 
                         spiritual woman. He tells me you've 
                         taught him a lot about discipline 
                         and self-control.

               Annie and Nuke exchange glances. Nuke smiles.

                                     ANNIE
                         He's a good student.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         We were worried that Ebby might get 
                         involved with the wrong crowd in 
                         professional baseball -- we're so 
                         pleased, he met a Christian woman.

                                     ANNIE
                         Praise the Lord, eh?

               The Piaf record begins skipping in the next room.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my -- I better fix that. Ebby 
                         will you help me? I'm no good with 
                         mechanical things

               Nuke picks up his cue and follows her to:

               THE LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- NIGHT

               Annie fixes the record.

                                     NUKE
                         I couldn't dump my old man but maybe 
                         later I can sneak away from him...

                                     ANNIE
                         You don't have to...

                                     NUKE
                         I'm starting to understand what you're 
                         teaching me. I mean the panties and 
                         the nostrils and all that shit... I 
                         mean I'm getting it --

                                     ANNIE
                         So am I. Nuke, honey, we need to 
                         talk --

               Nuke gets very aggressive and playful, pinning her.

                                     NUKE
                         Aw hell, let's have a quickie right 
                         here --

                                     ANNIE
                         -- but you're father's in there!

                                     NUKE
                         Crash says I gotta quit worrying 
                         about him -- c'mon, honey, we got a 
                         lotta catching up to do --

               He pins her to the wall, she squirms away.

                                     ANNIE
                         Nuke -- we do need to talk!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK IN THE KITCHEN

               Nuke's father is studying pictures on Annie's wall.

               CLOSE ON A HELMUT NEWTON PHOTO -- A nude woman, two afghans, 
               and a toilet.

               CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF SWAMI PRABHAVANANDA YOGANDA

               CLOSE ON A POSTER OF A MARIJUANA LEAF with the inscription 
               "Better Living Through Mexican Agriculture".

               Nuke's father is a bit unsettled by all this, when:

               The phone rings.

               ANNIE SWEEPS BACK into the kitchen -- saved by the bell -- 
               to answer the phone. Nuke trails.

                                     ANNIE
                              (on phone)
                         Hello? Skip? Yeah, as a matter of 
                         fact, he is here.

               She hands the phone to Nuke.

                                     ANNIE
                         It's Skip, for you.

                                     NUKE (ON PHONE)
                         Yeah, Skip, it's me.
                              (several beats)
                         Jeez... Jeez... God... Jeez...

               Nuke hangs up the phone. Looks at Annie and his father.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm going to the Show.
                              (beat)
                         They're sending me up to finish out 
                         the season with the Big Club. I'm 
                         going to the Show!

               NUKE'S FATHER LEAPS TO HIS FEET and embraces his son.

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         Let's have a quick word of prayer, 
                         right here, to thank the Lord for 
                         all this --

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh let's not...

                                     NUKE
                         I gotta leave first thing in the 
                         morning.

                                     ANNIE
                         That's great!

                                     NUKE
                         How can I possibly thank you?

               He embraces her rather formally.

                                     ANNIE
                         Just pitch well and do good.

               Nuke hustles his father out of the house.

                                     NUKE
                         I will, I will -- C'mon, Dad, I'll 
                         dump you off. I gotta find Crash.

               As they exit, Nuke's father turns to Annie:

                                     NUKE'S FATHER
                         God bless you.

                                     ANNIE
                              (to herself)
                         She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN in a kitchen chair. An enormous sigh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- NIGHT

               Nuke knocks on Crash's door. Nobody home. Tony is arriving 
               with his GROUPIE GIRLFRIEND to the next room.

                                     TONY
                         Crash ain't there. He never gets 
                         back till four or five --

                                     NUKE
                         Where does he go?

                                     TONY
                         Well, I'd rather not say.

                                     NUKE
                         They called me up to the Show and I 
                         wanta tell Crash goodbye.

               TONY COMES OVER AND GIVES NUKE a heartfelt "five".

                                     TONY
                         Goddamn, that's great! Jesus!

                         Listen, Crash don't like anybody to 
                         know it but --
                              (beat)
                         Most nights he goes down to, you 
                         know, down to Niggertown. To 
                         Sandy's... the whorehouse.

                                     NUKE
                         He goes to a whorehouse every night?

                                     TONY
                         Don't tell him I told you -- he'd 
                         break my neck.

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Disturbed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE BLACK SECTION OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

               A CAB MOVES SLOWLY through a poor neighborhood. Stops at:

               AN OLD HOUSE -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons.

                         That's Sandy's. Keep your extra cash 
                         In your shoes.

               NUKE GETS OUT and goes to the door.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               NUKE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR -- A small barred window opens.

               A face appears -- a TOUGH BLACK, SANDY, 50.

                                     SANDY
                         What'you want, kid?

                         I'm looking for somebody.

                                     SANDY
                         Who ain't?

                                     NUKE
                         Looking for Crash Davis.

                                     SANDY
                         Ain't here.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.

                                     SANDY
                              (studying him)
                         Your breaking ball's getting better 
                         but ya need a change up.

               The door opens. Nuke enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               NUKE ENTERS TENTATIVELY -- Another world. Grim. Sleazy.

               The Doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors. A BLACK 
               PROSTITUTE enters a room with a HUGE REDNECK. As they go 
               down the hallway, and as they do:

               We begin hearing singing -- raucous, soulful, drunk.

               NUKE STOPS IN A DOORWAY -- Looks into the "waiting room".

               -- P.O.V.  SEVERAL HOOKERS in various stages of undress, sit 
               on couches and chairs. Bored, smoking, ancient. The ONE WHITE 
               HOOKER, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar, 
               struggling to keep up. And a couple HOOKERS are hanging around 
               a piano that --

               CRASH IS PLAYING and singing. He doesn't look up. Crash is 
               dressed but barefoot. A cigarette dangles from his mouth as 
               he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords.

               Two Hookers at the piano hum along.

                                     CRASH
                              (singing and playing)
                         But when she does get weary -- Try a 
                         little tenderness...

               NUKE STEPS INTO THE ROOM -- All the Hookers rise in 
               anticipation of a new customer. Crash keeps playing, never 
               looking up.

                                     CRASH
                              (singing)
                         You know she's waiting, just 
                         anticipating, the things that she'll 
                         never possess...
                              (beat)
                         While she's there waiting -- Try a 
                         little tenderness...

               Nuke interrupts the instrumental passage:

                                     NUKE
                         Crash. I'm going to the Show.

               Crash Ignores him, keeps playing.

                                     NUKE
                         Club's expanding its roster to finish 
                         the season --

                                     CRASH
                         Shut up. I'm playing.
                              (singing last 8 bars)
                         Oh you won't regret it, young girls 
                         don't forget it, lost in their own 
                         wilderness...
                              (beat)
                         But it's all so easy -- Just try a 
                         little tenderness...

               As Crash plays on --

                                     NUKE
                         I'm going to the Show.

                                     CRASH
                         Then go.

               NUKE GRABS CRASH by the hair and jerks him to his feet. The 
               two men are face to face.

                                     NUKE
                         I'm trying to thank you.

                                     CRASH
                         Let go of me!

               NUKE LETS HIM GO and Crash staggers drunkenly against the 
               piano, regaining his balance as:

               SANDY RUSHES IN WITH A GUN to break it up.

                                     SANDY
                         He makin' trouble for you, Mr. Davis?

                                     CRASH
                         No, no, Sandy, put it down.
                              (drunkenly, to Nuke)
                         Nuke, you know Sandy Grimes? Hit 
                         .367 at Louisville in 155.

                                     SANDY
                         I hit .371.

                                     CRASH
                         He hit .371 -- C'mon, Nuke -- you 
                         and me, let's step outside and settle 
                         this.

                                     NUKE
                         Settle what?

                                     CRASH
                         C'mon!

                                     NUKE
                         I don't wanta fight you, I wanta 
                         thank you. Let's have a drink and 
                         forget this --

                                     CRASH
                         God damn it, you fucking virgin prick -- 
                         step outside.

               Crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear.  
               Nuke reluctantly follows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. THE ALLEY BEHIND THE WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT

               Several of the Hookers follow to watch. Crash is drunk and 
               lost. Nuke in control.

                                     NUKE
                         C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.

                                     CRASH
                         You fuck!

                                     NUKE
                         Why am I a fuck?

                                     CRASH
                         Why are you a fuck?
                              (beat)
                         'Cause you got talent. I got brains. 
                         But you got talent! You're God damn 
                         left arm is worth a million dollars 
                         a year.
                              (drunken insight)
                         All my limbs put together are worth 
                         7 cents a pound -- and that's for 
                         science and dog meat.

                                     NUKE
                         You're a great catcher.

                                     CRASH
                         Come over here into the light so I 
                         can kick your ass.

                                     NUKE
                         No.

                                     CRASH
                         Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

               Crash takes a step toward Nuke. Pulls up his bare feet 
               quickly, stepping on a sharp stone.

                                     CRASH
                         ...God damn... I forgot my fucking 
                         shoes. Honey, go get my shoes.

               One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes.

                                     NUKE
                         I'll take you back to the hotel.

                                     CRASH
                              (drunken, mad)
                         You know what the difference is 
                         between hitting .250 and hitting 
                         .300? I got it figured out.
                              (beat)
                         Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at 
                         bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 
                         months in a season, that's about 25 
                         weeks -- you get one extra flare a 
                         week -- just one -- a gork, a ground 
                         ball with eyes, a dying quail -- 
                         just one more dying quail a week and 
                         you're in Yankee Stadium!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE WHOREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

               THE HOOKER FINDS CRASH'S SHOES -- Starts to bring them out 
               to him when... she notices cash in one of them. The Hooker 
               takes a few bills for herself, and continues out --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               BACK IN THE ALLEY -- Crash finishes his tirade as:

               THE HOOKER COMES OUT WITH CRASH'S SHOES

               He struggles drunkenly to put them on.

                                     NUKE
                         Forget it. You ain't worth thanking --

               NUKE STARTS TO WALK AWAY -- Crash fires his one free shoe at 
               Nuke hitting him in the back of the head.

               NUKE WHIRLS -- Comes after Crash.

                                     CRASH
                         Come on, Meat...

               CRASH SWINGS WILDLY -- Nuke ducks it and levels Crash with a 
               short right hand.

               CRASH CRASHES INTO SOME GARBAGE CANS -- Lies there on his 
               back for several beats. Nuke stares.

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- Blood trickles from his mouth.

                                     CRASH
                         Nuke... tell me something. Did you 
                         hit me with your right or your left?

                                     NUKE
                         My right.

               Silence. Crash's next line is both drunk and sober and we 
               don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's 
               staged It all. Maybe even he doesn't know.

                                     CRASH
                         Good. Good. That's terrific...

                                     NUKE
                         What?

                                     CRASH
                         If ya get in a fight with some 
                         asshole, never hit his with your 
                         pitching hand. Ya might get injured.
                              (smiles)
                         That's another lesson for ya -- now 
                         quit fucking around and help me up.

               CRASH REACHES UP A HAND FOR HELP -- Nuke stares back.

               AND FINALLY NUKE REACHES DOWN AND HELPS CRASH to his feet.

                                     NUKE
                         Ya look like shit.

               The two men head inside.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- NEXT MORNING -- EARLY

               NUKE'S PORSCHE -- The Clubhouse Boy drags Nuke's out to the 
               car and loads the trunk. Annie, Larry and a COUPLE KIDS AND 
               DOGS are watching.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- CONTINUOUS -- DAY

               NUKE CLEANS OUT HIS LOCKER -- Filling his travel bag.

               Crash sits on a stool next to him. Sober.

                                     CRASH
                         Sorry about last night.

                                     NUKE
                         Forget it.

                                     CRASH
                         I have been known, on occasion, to 
                         howl at the moon. D'you understand 
                         that?

                                     NUKE
                         No.

                                     CRASH
                         You will.
                              (beat)
                         Look, Nuke -- these Big League hitters 
                         are gonna light you up like a pin 
                         ball machine for awhile -- don't 
                         worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant 
                         even when you're getting beat. That's 
                         the secret.
                              (beat)
                         You gotta play this game with fear 
                         and arrogance.

                                     NUKE
                         Fear and ignorance.

                                     CRASH
                              (raging)
                         No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, 
                         not ignorance!

                                     NUKE
                              (smiles calmly)
                         I know. I just like to see you get 
                         all worked up.

               Crash calms down. Sighs. Nuke nods and picks up his bags.

                                     NUKE
                              (knows it's not true)
                         Well, I got Annie all warmed up for 
                         ya...
                              (knows it is true)
                         She's just waiting for you to show 
                         up, y'know...

                                     CRASH
                         I don't need a crazy woman in my 
                         life.

                                     NUKE
                         Maybe you do.
                              (quick beat)
                         Y'know I'm starting to like this 
                         game -- baseball's a helluva good 
                         way to make a living.

               Crash speaks with quiet passion, from his soul.

                                     CRASH
                         It's the best, Nuke... the absolute 
                         fucking best.

                                     NUKE
                         Yeah, thanks for everything.

               They shake hands, and Nuke heads out the door.

                                     CRASH
                         Nuke --
                              (Nuke stops)
                         Good luck.

                                     NUKE
                         You too... Meat.

               Nuke smiles. A little arrogance and fear.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- CONTINUOUS DAY

               NUKE TOSSES HIS BAG in the Porsche and motions to Annie.  
               They step away from the others.

                                     ANNIE
                         Well I guess this is it.

                                     NUKE
                              (smiles)
                         I won't be needing these anymore.

               NUKE PULLS ANNIE'S RED PANTIES from his jacket pocket.

               The frilly, silk lace is tattered. The panties have been 
               through the mill. She accepts them graciously.

                                     ANNIE
                         Neither will I.

                                     NUKE
                         I think I'm ready for the Show.

                                     ANNIE
                         Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh -- don't 
                         think too much.

                                     NUKE
                         Don't worry.

               They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and:

               NUKE KISSES ANNIE GENTLY ON THE LIPS -- They hesitate, and 
               Nuke heads for his Porsche.

               CRASH ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY to watch. Nuke bids farewell to 
               his father and climbs into his car.

                                     NUKE
                         I gotta go now, Dad.

                                     FATHER
                         I was thinking I could fly up and 
                         spend a week in the Big Leagues with 
                         you -- help you get comfortable.

                                     NUKE
                         No. If I screw up, I wanta do it 
                         alone. I'll call.

                                     FATHER
                         We'll be praying for you.

                                     NUKE
                         Dad -- if my curveball is hanging, 
                         God ain't gonna help me.

                                     FATHER
                         We'll pray anyway.

                                     NUKE
                              (kindly)
                         If it makes you and mom feel better, 
                         go for it. I gotta run --

               They shake hands, and:

               CRASH'S P.O.V. -- NUKE ROARS AWAY in his Porsche, leaving a 
               trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- DUSK

               MILLIE AND JIMMY'S WEDDING -- A formal wedding on the 
               pitcher's mound. Millie in white. Jimmy in his uniform. Skip 
               is the best man, also in uniform, and several players and 
               groupies are the attendants, Annie as the Bride's Maid.

               Organ music plays the wedding march.

               JIMMY LIFTS MILLIE'S VEIL and kisses her. The stands are 
               full of fans.

               JIMMY LEADS MILLIE DOWN THE "AISLE" towards home plate.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- NIGHT

               CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Ninth inning. Durham is leading by a 
               score of 1 to 0. Two outs.

               JIMMY IS PITCHING -- He delivers. The batter rockets a line 
               drive up the alley. A PENINSULA RUNNER races from first, 
               rounding third, trying to score. A relay.

               CRASH WAITS AT THE PLATE -- Here comes the runner. Here comes 
               the throw. A close play. A terrible collision.

               Crash goes rolling. The umpire waits -- and in a cloud of 
               dust, Crash holds up the ball.

               THE CROWD ROARS -- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

               The air of victory. The mood is up and goofy. Beer cans are 
               squirted at Jimmy, the groom.

                                     JIMMY
                         I wanta thank everybody and the Lord 
                         for the victory, it's a wonderful 
                         way to celebrate my marriage -- and 
                         I guess we're all back on a winning 
                         streak, he? A few raucous "Fuckin 
                         A's" from the team.

                                     TONY
                         Hey, Jimmy -- we chipped in and kind 
                         got a little gift for ya of a special 
                         wedding cake from the Durham Bulls.

               DEKE CARRIES OUT AN WEDDING CAKE -- It's X-Rated. The 
               decorative Bride and Groom are fucking. Jimmy's embarrassed 
               but it's all good natured.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the 
               innocent, vulgar fun. He sits down in front of his locker, 
               drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches:

                                     CLUBHOUSE BOY
                         Hey, Crash -- Skip wants to see ya.

               CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a 
               towel and his shower shoes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame 
               routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed.

               CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off.

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?

                                     SKIP
                         Crash, shut the door.

               And it hits him. Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the 
               floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who 
               also looks away nervously.

               CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond.

                                     SKIP
                              (heartfelt)
                         This is the toughest job a manager 
                         has...

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be 
               surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised. And hurt. His stoicism 
               is professional.

                                     SKIP
                         The organization wants to make a

                         wanta bring up some young catcher...

                                     LARRY
                         Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg... 
                         probably a bust.

                                     SKIP
                         I put in a word for you with the 
                         organization -- told 'em I thought 
                         you'd make a fine minor league manager 
                         someday... Might be an opening at 
                         Salem next year --

               EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CRASH -- His eyes are moist.

                                     SKIP
                         Helluva year, Crash -- you know how 
                         it is.

               Silence.

               Crash stands there nearly nude. He just nods slightly. Without 
               rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the raucous 
               locker room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

               CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a 
               window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection.

               AND HE KEEPS WALKING INTO:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT/INT. CHEAP BAR IN DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT

               CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT

               CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods.

               HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops. Looks at the 
               street signs. He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               The windows glow. After midnight.

               CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the 
               porch stairs. Knocks at the door. Moments later:

               ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful. Almost as if 
               she was expecting him. At first, silence. Then:

                                     CRASH
                         I got released.

                                     ANNIE
                         I heard already.

               SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               ANNIE PUTS ON her favorite Piaf record.

               ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them.

               CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a 
               tiny gasp. He kisses her forehead. She kisses his neck. A 
               tiny smile from Crash. The same from Annie.

               SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth. Her hand finds 
               the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his 
               hair.

               CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply.  As --

               HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the 
               skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg. At last exposing 
               the beloved BLACK GARTER SNAPS -- Crash's hand expertly holds 
               up the skirt and effortlessly UNSNAPS THE GARTER with a 
               minimum of effort.

               FLICK, FLICK, FLICK -- The garter snaps are free.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE BEDROOM -- Crash carries Annie to the bed.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANNIE'S FOOT KICKS OVER A LAMP onto the floor.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANNIE'S BLOUSE FRONT -- Flick, flick, flick. Crash unbuttons 
               it with one hand in seconds. Even Annie is startled with the 
               speed and ease of Crash's hand.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               HER HAND SLIDES UNDER THE WAISTBAND of his underwear

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               HIS HAND SLIDES UP UNDER HER panties.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               A FULL EMBRACE ON THE EDGE OF THE BED -- Remnants of clothes

               the floor.

               ANNIE'S HAND GRABS ONTO A DRESSER LEG -- A carved oak antique, 
               her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE DRESSER TOP SHAKES -- Makeup bottles and pictures and 
               dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall

               ANNIE'S READ RESTS ON CRASH'S STOMACH -- Post coital, they 
               lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes.

               THE KITCHEN -- ANNIE AND CRASH eat an after mid after sex 
               snack. Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties. They each wear one of 
               her robes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana 
               she keeps in a Victorian jewel box.

                         ...so you see in a former lifetime 
                         I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the 
                         Czarette of Russia? What do you think?

                                     CRASH
                         How come in former lifetimes, 
                         everybody was someone famous?
                              (beat)
                         How come nobody ever says they were

                                     ANNIE
                         It doesn't work like that.
                              (stares at him)
                         God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?

               THEY KISS AGAIN -- And fall gradually onto the table top.

               ANNIE SITS ON TOP OF CRASH lying on the kitchen table.

               He stretches out a leg and:

               KICKS THE BOWL OF CEREAL to the floor. It smashes -- ceramics, 
               milk, cereal go everywhere. As:

               THEY START MAKING LOVE AGAIN in the glaring kitchen light.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CRASH AND ANNIE DANCE in her living room.

               THE BEDROOM -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed. He seems 
               perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman.

               ANNIE HANDCUFFED TO THE BED -- Crash reads.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CRASH AT ANNIE'S RECORD COLLECTION -- He thumbs through it 
               quickly, puts on a new record.

               The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man".  And...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               THE BATHROOM -- Candlelight around the bathtub. All we can 
               make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the 
               dim glow. Water splashes, dowses some candles.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CRASH AND ANNIE IN BED READING -- Each with a copy of a Thomas 
               Pynchon novel. Crash tosses it aside. And disappears under 
               the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading.  
               She puts down the book.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               ANNIE APPLYING EYE MAKEUP TO CRASH -- Who doesn't resist, 
               seems even amused. He kisses her deeply, slowly. She kisses 
               him back. They fall onto the bed.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               P.O.V.  OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW -- Dawn. A bird chirps.

               And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly.

               PAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN -- Overturned chairs, spilled and 
               broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles.

               PAN ACROSS THE BEDROOM -- A disaster. Clothes scattered across 
               the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle.  
               Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent.

               CRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -- Reaches up and pulls his underwear 
               off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of 
               bed. He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit, 
               into:

               THE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room.  
               Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions, 
               pictures hanging crookedly on the wall.

               CRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes 
               a sigh of relief. He sees his pants lying on the floor and 
               pulls them on.

               CRASH OPENS A DRAWER -- Pulls out a piece of paper and a 
               pencil. He starts writing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE BEDROOM -- LATER

               Sun streams in. Annie opens her eyes. Rubs them. Reaches 
               over for Crash. Her hand hits a note. She whirls. He's gone. 
               Only a note.

               SHE SITS UP WITH A START and reads the note.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         Crash said he had to get an early 
                         start to drive to Asheville in the 
                         South Atlantic League where he heard 
                         they might need a catcher to finish 
                         out the season...

               ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NOTE -- "Love, Crash".

               INT. ANNIE'S KITCHEN -- DAY

               ANNIE SCRUBBING HER KITCHEN FLOOR -- Down on her hands and 
               knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The house smelled like sex for days. 
                         It was wonderful. The only real 
                         cleaning I did was on the kitchen 
                         floor 'cause who likes to walk on 
                         spilt cereal?

               SHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning.  
               She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights 
               the tiny joint.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The funny thing is, I stopped worrying 
                         about Nuke. Somehow I knew nothing 
                         would stop him. Crash was right --
                         Nuke had a gift.

               NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium. 
               50,000 seats. Slick. Awesome. He's being interviewed by a 
               BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck 
               mike in Nuke's face.

                                     NUKE
                              (like a big leaguer)
                         Y'know, I'm just happy to be here 
                         and hope I can help the ballclub. I 
                         just want to give it my best shot 
                         and good Lord willing, things'll 
                         work out... gotta play 'em one day 
                         at a time, Y'know...

               THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly 
               delivers the clichés like a veteran.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety 
               old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside.

               CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen 
               him in, of course. The Asheville Tourists. He picks up some 
               dirt, rubs it on his hands. He's as intense as ever. Still 
               playing for keeps.

                                     CRASH

                         shit -- c'mon, bring the heat, bring 
                         it, bring it...

               CRASH'S P.O.V. -- SLO-MO AS THE PITCHER WINDS AND delivers a 
               fastball right down the pipe.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON

               ANNIE LIES IN BED READING -- She suddenly jerks up.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I was reading in bed when Crash hit 
                         his 247th home run. I knew the moment 
                         it happened...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ASHEVILLE STADIUM -- DAY

               CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees. He 
               stands at home plate watching it... like Reggie or the Babe.

               And doesn't move. For several seconds he indulges himself 
               uncharacteristically -- until...

               THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.

                                     CATCHER
                         Get your ass in gear...

               CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly. As he heads 
               toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment, 
               a tiny gesture of triumph. And then, routinely, he just 
               circles the bases.

               A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT

               SHE LIGHTS A CANDLE for the home run. Above the candles, 
               displayed in the shrine, are her RED PANTIES.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         I lit a candle for Crash's dinger... 
                         and tried to root the Durham Bulls 
                         home to a pennant.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DURHAM STADIUM -- DAY

               ANNIE AND JACKSON OPEN AN UMBRELLA in her familiar place in 
               the stadium. Umbrellas go up all around, as:

               THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts.

               IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric 
               Yoga of Sex". And spitting tobacco.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good 
                         enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if 
                         ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement 
                         had a fastball that I coulda hit
                              (beat)
                         We had a three game lead with two 
                         weeks to go when the rains came.

               THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.

                                     ANNIE (V.O.)
                         It rained and rained and I thought 
                         of driving down to Asheville to see 
                         Crash but then I thought "No, what 
                         you pursue, eludes you". I had to 
                         trust Quantum Physics and the Church 
                         of Baseball.

                         It ain't always easy being this 
                         religious...

               ANNIE AND JACKSON POP OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS and walk out of 
               the ballpark towards home.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops. Looks up. Crash's beat up 
               car in the driveway.

               P.O.V.  CRASH SITTING ON THE PORCH SWING Still raining.

               CLOSE ON ANNIE -- She hesitates, and smiles.

                                     ANNIE
                         Oh my...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.

                                     ANNIE
                         What happened?

                                     CRASH
                         I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em 
                         up.

               A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.

                                     ANNIE
                         I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.

                                     CRASH
                         There might be an opening for a 
                         manager at Salem next spring.

                                     ANNIE
                         Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the 
                         witches were?

                                     CRASH
                         Yeah... you a witch?

                                     ANNIE
                         Not yet. It takes years of practice...

               He smiles slightly and takes her hand.

                                     CRASH
                         You think I could make it to the 
                         Show as a manager?

                                     ANNIE
                         You'd be great, just great...
                              (rattling quickly)
                         'Cause you understand non-linear 
                         thinking even though it seems like 
                         baseball is a linear game 'cause of 
                         the lines and the box scores an'  
                         all -- but the fact is that there's 
                         a spacious-"non-time kind of time" 
                         to it...

                                     CRASH
                              (interrupting)
                         Annie --

                                     ANNIE
                         What?

                                     CRASH
                         I got a lotta time to hear your 
                         theories and I wanta hear every damn 
                         one of 'em... but right now I'm tired 
                         and I don't wanta think about baseball 
                         and I don't wanta think about Quantum 
                         Physics... I don't wanta think about 
                         nothing...
                              (beat)
                         I just wanta be.

                         I can do that, too.

               He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside.

               And as the rains fall on Durham...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

               THE SHRINE GLOWS -- Candles everywhere. Rain pours down on 
               the windows outside. And...

               ANNIE AND CRASH SIT ON THE COUCH together, in silence.

                                     ANNIE
                         Walt Whitman once said -- "I see 
                         great things in baseball. It's our 
                         game -- the American game

                         He said "it will repair our losses 
                         and be a blessing to us"...
                              (beat)
                         You could look it up....

               The music -- Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo".

1   EXT. EASTERN SEABOARD - AERIALS - DAY                           1

    High in the air----so high we an see the curvature of the
    earth. The eastern seaboard stretches away, flecked with
    clouds.

    As we dissolve in closer the picture bleaches of color.   We
    are looking down at the city of Washington, D.C.

    Dissolve closer still: a black-and-white aerial photograph of
    a neighborhood in suburban D.C. dominated by a sprawling
    building. Computer type quickly bleeps on:

                  C.I.A. Headquarters
                   Langley, Virginia


2   INT. CIA - HALLWAY - DAY                                        2

    We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of
    someone walking down the well polished hallway.


3   INT. PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY                                      3

    We hear a door opening and a silver-haired man rises behind
    his desk. A nameplate on the desk identifies him as Palmer
    DeBakey Smith.

                          PALMER
              Ozzie.    Sit down.

    Osbourne Cox, entering, is a middle-aged man in a striped
    shirt and bow tie.

                         OSBOURNE
              Palmer.   What's up.

                        PALMER
              You know Peck, and Olson.

    The two men, sitting on chairs facing the desk, nod at
    Osbourne, who is surprised to see them.

                        OSBOURNE
              Peck, yes, hiya. Olson, by
              reputation. Hi, Osbourne Cox.

                        OLSON
              Yeah, hiyah.

                                                       2.


                    OSBOURNE
          Aren't you with...aren't you,
          uh...

Palmer jumps in:

                    PALMER
          Yeah, that's right. Oz, look.
          There's no easy way to say this.
          We're taking you off the Balkans desk.

                      OSBOURNE
          You're----what? Why?

                    PALMER
          In fact we're moving you out of Sigint
          entirely.

                      OSBOURNE
          ...What?    No discussion, just----you're
          out?

                    PALMER
          Well, we're having the discussion now
          Oz. This doesn't have to be
          unpleasant.

                    OSBOURNE
          Palmer, with all due respect----what the
          fuck are you talking about?

A beat.

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ... And why is Olson here?

Another uncomfortable beat.

                    PALMER
          ... Look, Ozzie----

                    OSBOURNE
          What the fuck is this?!     Is it my----I
          know it's not my work.

                      PALMER
          Ozzie----

                    OSBOURNE
          I'm a great fucking analyst!     Is it----

                    PALMER
          Oz, things are not going well.      As you
          know.

                                                        3.


                       PECK
             You have a drinking problem.

Stunned silence.         Ozzie turns to look at Peck.

At length:

                       OSBOURNE
             I have a drinking problem.

                       PALMER
             This doesn't have to be unpleasant.
             We found you something in State. It's
             a, uh...

He gropes, uncomfortable.

                       PALMER (CONT'D)
             ... It's a lower clearance level.
             Yes. But we're not, this isn't, we're
             not terminating you.

                       OSBOURNE
                 (quietly)
             This is an assault.

                       PECK
             Come on, Ozzie.

                       OSBOURNE
             This is an assault. I have a drinking
             problem? Fuck you, Peck, you're a
             Mormon!

                           PECK
             Ozzie----

                       OSBOURNE
             Next to you we all have a drinking
             problem! Fuck you guys! Whose ass
             didn't I kiss? Let's be honest!

Palmer nods at Olson.

                       PALMER
             Okay, Olson----

                       OSBOURNE
             Let's be fucking honest...

Osbourne gets to his feet, agitated.

                                                                 4.


                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... This is a crucifixion! This is
               political! Don't tell me it's not!

    He storms out the door.

                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... I have a drinking problem!

    The door slams.   Palmer Smith looks at Olson.     Olson arches
    an eyebrow.


4   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                            4

    OSBOURNE

    Bow tie loosened, he stands at a kitchen counter.

    His shoulders twist as he does something below frame: we hear
    the crackle of ice cubes wrenching loose from a tray.

    Behind him we see the apartment door opening. Katie, an
    attractive middle-aged woman, enters, taking her key out of
    the door, but stops, surprised to see Osbourne.

                         KATIE
               You're home.

    Osbourne continues making himself a drink.

                         OSBOURNE
               Hang on to your hat, honey.    I have
               some news. I----

                         KATIE
               Did you pick up the cheeses?

                         OSBOURNE
               Huh?

                         KATIE
               Were they ready? I didn't know you
               were coming home this early.

                         OSBOURNE
                   (blank)
               The cheeses.

    Katie rolls her eyes.

                                                       5.


                        KATIE
              I left a message for you to stop at
              Todaro's. The Magruders and the
              Pfarrers are coming over.

                        OSBOURNE
              The Pfarrers? Ugh.    I----what did
              Kathleen say?

                          KATIE
              What?

                        OSBOURNE
              When you left the message?

                          KATIE
              She said.    She would give you.   The
              message.

                        OSBOURNE
              Well she, I don't know, I guess we had
              bigger news today. My day didn't
              revolve arou----

                        KATIE
              So you didn't get the cheeses.

                        OSBOURNE
              Well, since I didn't get the message,
              no, I didn't get the cheeses. But
              hang on to your hat, I----

                        KATIE
              Oh for fuck's sake, Ozzie, you mean I
              have to go out again? All right,
              well, you better get dressed.

                        OSBOURNE
              Honey, we have to talk.

                        KATIE
              Not right now. They'll be here in,
              what, less than an hour.


5   INT. COX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                            5

    A hand hovers, hesitates.

                        VOICE
              Is this a, uh, goat cheese?

                        OSBOURNE (OFF)
              Chevre, yes, that is a goat cheese.

                                     Pink Revision 8/14/07 6.


Wider shows the cocktail party, meagerly attended but in full
swing. Besides Osbourne and Katie there is Harry Pfarrer
(who has just inquired about the cheese), bearded, forties,
rugged; his wife Sandy; and a shiny-faced young couple, Doug
and Tina Magruder.

Osbourne holds a cocktail tumbler.

                    HARRY
          Because I have lactose reflux.    But I
          can----

                    OSBOURNE
          You're lactose intolerant?

                    HARRY
          Yes, but I can----

                    OSBOURNE
          Or you have acid reflux?    They're two
          different things.

Harry looks at him coldly.

                    HARRY
          I know what they are.

                    OSBOURNE
          Then you misspoke yourself.    So I----

                    HARRY
          Thank you for correcting me.

                    KATIE
          You should try the chevre, Harry.
          It's very good.

                     HARRY
          Yeah.   I can eat goat cheese.

He eats a piece, cupping one hand under his mouth.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... I was just explaining to your
          husband here, I have a condition----

Katie tries to separate the two men by including Doug
Magruder.

                    KATIE

          If you want he'll show you his great
          big gun.

                    HARRY
          Very amusing. The gun is actually no
          big deal. Twenty years in the
          marshall's service and I've never
          discharged my weapon.

                    OSBOURNE
          Sounds like something you should be
          telling your psychiatrist.

                     HARRY
          What?   I don't have a psychiatrist.

                    DOUG MAGRUDER
          Boy, I guess my job is pretty
          undramatic. I'm on the legislative
          side. What do you do Mrs. Pfarrer? Do
          you also carry a gun?

Harry laughs.

                    HARRY
          Sandy writes children's books.

                    SANDY
          I write children's books----

                    HARRY
          Oliver The Cat Who...Who..arghh----Who----

Choking on piece of cheese, coughing

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ...Who Lives In The Rotunda.     Excuse
          me.

                      TINA
          Those are wonderful!    My nieces and
          nephews----

                                                              8.


                         HARRY
               Yeah, it's a beloved series. You
               wouldn't believe her fan mail. Unghh.
               Are you sure this is goat cheese?

                         KATIE
               Why don't you let your wife tell them
               about her own books, Harry?

                          HARRY
               I'm sorry----was I----

                         KATIE
               Here, come in the kitchen, help me
               with the crudités.


6    INT. COX KITCHEN - NIGHT                                       6

     They enter.

                            HARRY
               Goddamnit.     He knows, doesn't he.

     He looks down at the floor.        He stamps.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... Nice floors.

                         KATIE
               Knows what?

     Harry is looking around the kitchen, taking in the fixtures.
     Absently:

                         HARRY
               About us, he knows about us.          Little
               prick.

                         KATIE
               Don't be an ass, he doesn't know a
               thing.

     Harry is staring down at the linoleum again.

                         HARRY
               What is that, forbo?


A6   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                            A6

     A car drives by.

                                                             9.


7   INT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT                                      7

    Harry driving, his wife next to him.

    A long beat.

    Finally:

                         HARRY
               What a horse's ass.

                         SANDY
               I don't know why we see them.

    Harry shrugs.

                         HARRY
               Well, she's all right.

                         SANDY
               She is a cold, stuck-up bitch.

    Harry opens his mouth to reply, considers, doesn't.

    They drive.


8   INT. COX MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                               8

    KATIE

    She is staring, in front of a mirror, face covered in cold
    cream, one hand arrested on the way up to daub on more.

                            KATIE
               You quit?!

    Osbourne is buttoning a pajama top.

                            OSBOURNE
               Uh-huh.

                           KATIE
               Well----Thank you for letting me know!

                         OSBOURNE
               I tried to tell you this afternoon.

                         KATIE
               You tried? You tried? And then----
               what, the aphasia kicked in?

                         OSBOURNE
               Our guests came. We----

                                         10.


            KATIE
Why?!    For fuck's sake, Ozzie!

            OSBOURNE
I'm just----I don't know.    I got so
tired.

          KATIE
You're tired.

          OSBOURNE
Tired of swimming against the current.

               KATIE
Uh-huh.

          OSBOURNE
Independent thought is not only not
valued there, they resist it, they
fight it, the bureaucracy is
positively----

          KATIE
Did you get a pension, or severance or
something, or----

          OSBOURNE
I didn't retire you know, I, I quit.
I don't want their benefits.

          KATIE
But I suppose my benefits are all
right, I suppose you can live with
those, is that the idea?

          OSBOURNE
It's not like that's the only way to
make money.

               KATIE
Yes?    Yes?     What're you gonna do?

          OSBOURNE
I'll do some consulting.

          KATIE
Consulting.

          OSBOURNE
Yes, to help while I----I've always
wanted to write.

            KATIE
Write.    Write what.

                                                           11.


                           OSBOURNE
                 I've been thinking about it.    A book,
                 a sort of, sort of memoir.

    Katie stares at him in the mirror.

    A beat.

    She bursts into laughter.


9   EXT. YACHT/AT SEA - DAY                                        9

    THE BRIDGE

    A small yacht. Osbourne stands at the wheel, a light wind in
    his face, as the boat sails under motor power.

    After a beat he moves to the front of the boat.

    An old man sits on a bench on the prow facing out into the
    wind. He has snowy hair and a stern Yankee face. He wears a
    tweed cap. He doesn't much react to Osbourne's approach.

                           OSBOURNE
                 You okay there, Dad?

    The old man remains silent, staring. Osbourne sits next to
    him and idly tucks in the plaid blanket resting over the
    man's knees.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... Dad, I left my job at the
                 Agency...

    The old man stares out into the wind.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... I, uh... I'm sorry. Dad,
                 government service is not what it was
                 when you were in State. Things are
                 different now. I don't know, maybe
                 it's... it's... the Cold War ending;
                 now it seems like it's all bureaucracy
                 and no mission...

    The old man stares out into the wind.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... I'm writing a memoir. I think
                 it's going to be pretty explosive.
                 But I don't think you'll disapprove.
                 I don't think you'll disapprove.
                 Katie has had trouble accepting it.
                           (MORE)

                                                             12.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               But... sometimes there's a higher
               patriotism, Dad. So we'll... Yes,
               change is hard. It's hard on Katie.
               But we'll be okay. We'll be okay.
               Life is change. This is good. We
               were all blocked up, Katie and me.
               This is, this is a blessing in
               disguise. I'll go into training, you
               know. Lay off the sauce. Like you
               did. You managed to do it. Finally.
               And then I can concentrate on, you
               know. New beginning. And this'll all
               have been for the best. Don't you
               think Dad?

     The old man stares out into the wind.

     Osbourne sniffles.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... Cold.

     He taps the old man on the knee and rises.

                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... I guess we should head back.


10   EXT. PIER - DAY                                                10

     LONG SHOT THRU THE WINDSHIELD OF A CAR

     The sailboat docked at the end of a marina. Osbourne is
     pushing the old man in a wheel chair down the pier away from
     the boat.

                         A MAN'S VOICE
               We've seen this...


11   INT. LAW FIRM - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                          11

     THE MAN

     White hair, bushy eyebrows, a florid face. He is in a law-
     book lined conference room. He wears an expensive suit,
     suspenders, a white shirt with blue collar and cuffs. He is
     Bogus Terikhian.

                          TERIKHIAN
               ... I know this kind of man.    We've
               seen this.

                                                        13.


Wider on the conference room shows that Katie Cox sits at the
table, along with Terikhian, another lawyer, and an
assistant.

                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
             ... Mrs. Cox, you can't let this man
             take advantage of you. And he will.
             He will.

                         KATIE
             Yes. This is my fear. He's trying----
             he says----he's trying to pull himself
             together, but...

                       TERIKHIAN
             Look, sure, I----I'm obliged to tell you
             you should try to salvage things. And
             you should. People turn themselves
             around. Not unheard-of. But. You----
             you haven't broached the possibility
             of divorce yet?

                         KATIE
             No.

                       TERIKHIAN
             Well that's good.   Because first you
             should get all his financials. Before
             he's forewarned. Because here's a
             man, here's a man, practiced in
             deceit, this is almost, you could say
             it's his job, practiced at hiding
             things, and there is no reason, it is
             not improper, there is no reason for
             you not to get a picture of the
             household finances. Paper files,
             computer files, whatever----this is your
             prerogative. You can be a spy too,
             madam. Do this before you put him on
             alert. Before the turtle can draw in
             his head and his, uh...

He waggles his hands, groping for the word.

                         TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
             ... Feet.

He shrugs.

                       TERIKHIAN (CONT'D)
             ... And hopefully everything will work
             out. He will reform. But! If not:
             forewarned is forearmed.

                                                              14.


12   INT. COX HOUSE - DAY                                            12

     Osbourne is splayed on an easy chair, wearing a bathrobe over
     pyjamas. He stares at the ceiling, motionless, arms out-
     flung, like Marat in his bathtub.

     A long still beat.   A clock ticks.

     Abruptly Osbourne raises one hand to speak into a
     microcassette recorder.

                         OSBOURNE
               We were young and committed and there
               was nothing we couldn't do. We
               thought of the Agency less as... less
               as...

     The thought, such as it was, peters out.   Osbourne rises and
     wanders around the room, glassy-eyed.

     He suddenly raises the microcassette again.

                         OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
               ... The principles of George Kennan----a
               personal hero of mine----were what
               animated us. In fact they were what
               had originally inspired me to enter
               government service. Like the State
               Department's China Hands of yore, or,
               in a different forum, in a different
               venue, in a different medium, in,
               um... "Murrow's Boys," the fabled----in
               a different----

     He suddenly stops, head cocked, listening.

     Faintly, a ringing phone.


13   INT. COX BASEMENT STAIRWAY - DAY                                13

     At the cut Osbourne is thundering down a steep carpeted
     stairway. He inclines his head to clear the ceiling that
     juts over the bottom half of the stairwell.

     The phone is louder here.


14   INT. COX BASEMENT - DAY                                         14

     A semi-finished basement with cheap paneling and a low
     dropped ceiling of water-stained Johnson-Armstrong tile. The
     ringing phone is on a cheap government-surplus desk. The
     answering machine, with Osbourne's voice, picks up:

                                                                 15.


                          MACHINE
                You have reached The Cox Group...

     Osbourne, robe flapping, shuffles hurriedly in his slippered
     feet toward the phone.

                          MACHINE (CONT'D)
                ... We can't answer your call right
                now. Please leave a----

                          OSBOURNE
                    (heavy breathing)
                Hello.

     He eases into the chair, having swiped up the phone.    A
     listening beat.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... Yes?... Oh, no... No, call her
                number... No, upstairs...No she's not,
                but leave it on her machine.


15   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER                                     15

     We are looking over Osbourne's shoulder----he is still in his
     robe----as he sits hunched on an ottoman, looking at a daytime
     game show.

     A few beats of the show.

     Roaring laughter from the studio audience.     Mild chuckle from
     Osbourne in the foreground.


16   INT LIVING ROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                                16

     Ticking clock. Osbourne paces with the microcassette
     recorder. He raises it with a thought, draws a breath, and
     then stops, and looks off.

     The ticking grandfather clock: ornate hands on an ornate
     clock face Two or three minutes to five.

     Osbourne stares for a long beat.


17   INT. COX KITCHEN - DAY                                             17

     OSBOURNE

     Shoulders twisting as we hear ice clattering out of a tray.

     He pours coke sizzling onto the ice.

                                                              16.


     He pauses for a long beat.

     He takes a bottle of rum out of a cabinet.

     He pours some into a hatch-marked shot glass.

     He looks at it. The amber liquid tops the hatch mark.    He
     conscientiously pours the overage back, murmuring:

                            OSBOURNE
               Single...

     He dumps the shot into the Coke.


18   EXT. SAILBOAT - DUSK                                            18

     As before, the boat, docked at the end of the marina pier, is
     seen in long shot through the windshield of a car.

     Closer on the boat. As water laps against pilings and the
     boat gently bobs and creaks, we hear, muffled, the sounds of
     a couple having sex. When it builds to climax we cut:


19   INT. SAILBOAT - DUSK                                            19

     Minutes later. We hold on a door for a quiet beat, then we
     hear the gurgle of water, and then the door opens. Harry
     Pfarrer emerges from the small bathroom, buckling his belt.

     In the bedroom which he emerges into Katie Cox is just
     finishing dressing.

     Harry looks at his watch.

                         HARRY
               I should try to get a run in.


20   INT. COX HOUSE - DUSK                                           20

     Katie is letting herself in.

                            KATIE
               Ozzie!

     Quiet.


21   INT. KITCHEN - DUSK                                             21

     Katie enters and sees a note on the counter paperweighted by
     a plate of used lime wedges:

                                                                  17.



               Honey,

               At Fenninger's.     Reunion committee
               dinner.
               See you later.


22   EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DUSK                                         22

     Long-lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry Pfarrer is
     jogging in his Treasury sweats.

     Closer on him.   Brow furrows.   He spins, jogs backwards,
     looking.

     His point-of-view: nothing unusual; traffic on the bridge, no
     pedestrians particularly close.

     Harry, mildly puzzled, slows and stops.    He turns again.

     Point-of-view up the bridge: empty.

     Harry starts jogging again.


23   INT. COX BASEMENT - NIGHT                                          23

     We are tracking toward the desk in the corner, at which Katie
     sits. She cracks open a CD case and loads the CD into
     Osbourne's computer. A suspense drone builds as we track in.

     Katie starts typing, then suddenly stops. She holds still,
     listening for noises in the house. Nothing. She resumes
     typing.

     We hear male voices beginning to swell in song. The voices
     continue after the suspense drone snaps off, at the cut to:


24   INT. FENNINGER'S - NIGHT                                           24

     A musty steakhouse. On the walls are hunting-scene prints
     and steel engravings of English country houses.

     A placard resting on a chair outside the Georgian Room:
     CLOSED FOR PRIVATE PARTY.

     From inside the room, male voices:

                         VOICES
               Tune every heart and every voice...

                                                             18.


25   INT. FENNINGER'S - GEORGIAN ROOM - NIGHT                        25

     A dozen middle-aged men around a long table, each holding
     high a glass.

                          MEN
                ... Bid every care withdraw.    Let all
                with one accord rejoice...

     The men are sweaty, tie-loosened, dinner-stuffed and boozy.

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... In praise of Old Nassau...

     Close on Osbourne as a rotund middle-aged classmate fills his
     glass to brimming. The two sway unsteadily with the music..

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... In praise of Old Nassau my boys,
                Hoo-rah, hoo-rah, hoorah!

     All swing their glasses side-to-side in rhythm:

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... Her sons... shall give... while
                they... shall live...

     Glasses are thrust high with a ringing finish:

                          MEN (CONT'D)
                ... In praise of Old Nassau!


26   INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY                                            26

     A WOMAN'S ASS

     Bare.   Pale.   Middle-aged.

     Someone with a marker is drawing on the flesh to illustrate:

                          DOCTOR (OFF)
                We take all the chicken fat off your
                buttocks, here... and here... And the
                upper arms. And a little off your
                tummy...

     The camera is arcing around a standing, naked, middle-aged
     woman, to reveal the doctor sitting on a stool in the
     examining room, facing her. He reaches forward again with
     the marker.

                                                        19.


                    DOCTOR (OFF) (CONT'D)
          ...And we do breast augmentation with
          a tiny incision here... and here.

                      PATIENT (OFF)
          Uh-huh.    And what about the thigh
          area?

                    DOCTOR
          Well we can do liposuction there as
          well, but that area will respond to
          exercise. Buttocks and upper arms
          begin to store more fat when you get
          up around forty, the body just tells
          it to go there, but the thighs will
          respond to toning exercises.

                    PATIENT
          Uh-huh. I know, I can work out on my
          arms til the cows come home, but...

                    DOCTOR
          Uh-huh. And of course there are also
          genetic factors.

                    PATIENT
          The Litzkes are big.

                    DOCTOR
          Uh-huh, well everything's----

                    PATIENT
          My mom had an ass that could pull a
          bus.

                      DOCTOR
          Wow.    Well that's a predispo----

                    PATIENT
          Father's side too, although Dad tends
          to carry his weight in front of him.

                      DOCTOR
          Uh-huh.

                    PATIENT
          In the gut area. Derriere, not so
          much.

                      DOCTOR
          Okay.

The continuing track around is also booming up to reveal the
face of the patient, Linda Litzke.

                                                                20.


                           LINDA
                 And what about the face, you know, the
                 window to the soul.

                           DOCTOR
                 Uh-huh! Uh-huh! Very well put. Well
                 your eyes are one of your best
                 features. But we can do something
                 about the incipient crow's feet.

                           LINDA
                 Baby crow's feet. Little chickling's
                 feet. I mean chicks. Chickie chickie
                 chickie.

                           DOCTOR
                 Ha-ha, yes, again, well put. You have
                 a way with words. We cut here...

     He marks.

                           DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                 ... And we pull the skin tight, like
                 stretching the skin over a drum. Not
                 too tight, though. We don't want that
                 "worked-on" look. You need sufficient
                 slack for the face to remain
                 expressive.

                           LINDA
                 Yeah, I don't wanna look like Boris
                 Karloff.

                           DOCTOR
                 Uh-huh! Heh-heh, so you don't want a
                 sex change!

                           LINDA
                 No, I'm all woman!


27   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY                                       27

     Doctor and patient, now dressed, sit on either side of a
     desk.

                           DOCTOR
                 So Linda, what we're talking about
                 here is four different procedures.
                     (ticks them off)
                 The liposuction... The rhinoplasty...
                 The facial tuck, which I would
                 strongly recommend over the chemical
                 peel----

                                                             21.


                         LINDA
               Yeah, I don't want to get anything
               burned off.

                         DOCTOR
               And why should you. With that lovely
               skin. And lastly, the breast
               augmentation. Now we can also do
               something about the vaccine scar----I
               don't know if you wear sleeveless
               dresses much----

                         LINDA
               Not with these ham hocks!

                         DOCTOR
               Yes, well once they're nice and
               svelte, post-op, you----

                           LINDA
               Well I don't know. Is the vaccine
               thing----can you counsel me on this? I
               don't know, is it unsightly? I see it
               a lot, a bunch of people have it.

                         DOCTOR
               Absolutely! Some women don't mind it
               at all! Personal taste!


28   INT. HARDBODIES - DAY                                           28

     Linda Litzke, in a Hardbodies polo shirt with "Linda"
     stitched on the breast, leans out of her semi-enclosed office
     on the gym floor.

                         LINDA
               Chad!


29   INT. HARDBODIES - GYM FLOOR - DAY                               29

     Chad Feldheimer, trainer, fortyish and well-muscled, has a
     gym patron up on a table and is helping him stretch a leg
     back.

                         PATRON
               Ow!

                         CHAD
               I'm sorry, was that too much?

                                                                22.


                         PATRON
               I felt a straining... a tightness in
               the... in the front of my ass...

                         CHAD
               Well you're pretty tight.     You have to
               feel it or----

                         LINDA
                   (on the public address)
               Chad Feldheimer. Office.

                         CHAD
               I'll be back in a minute.     We'll work
               on opening those hips.


30   INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY                                        30

     Linda is tapping at her computer as Chad enters.

                         LINDA
               I got a batch from BeWithMeDC dot com.

     Chad perches on the desk, chewing gum as he gazes at the
     screen.

                          CHAD
               Oh wow.   Any good?

                         LINDA
               I don't know yet, just looking... How
               do you open this?

                         CHAD
               Click on, uh... yeah...

                            LINDA
               Oh my god!

                            CHAD
               What?

                         LINDA
               Oh my God, what a loser!

     She clicks.

                            LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... Loser!

     She clicks.   Chad is laughing.   Linda scowls.

                                           23.


          LINDA (CONT'D)
... Loser!... What is this! They
should call this Mr. Saggy dot com.

             CHAD
Cripes.

             LINDA
Loser!

          CHAD
Did you have to send a picture?

          LINDA
No, only guys do. I submitted a
verbal profile, turn-ons, turn-offs,
et cetera. I'm really looking for
someone with a sense of humor.

            CHAD
That guy----wait----that guy wasn't bad.

             LINDA
Him?

          CHAD
No, before.

             LINDA
Him?

            CHAD
Yeah.    He uh, he might not be a loser.

          LINDA
How can you tell?

          CHAD
That's a Brioni suit.

             LINDA
Oh yeah?

             CHAD
Shit yeah.

          LINDA
    (dubious)
Does he look like he has a sense of
humor?

          CHAD
He looks like his optometrist has a
sense of humor.

                                                             24.


     Linda slaps his arm.

                         CHAD (CONT'D)
               ... Huh-huh-huh. What does he do?

                         LINDA
               State Department.

                         CHAD
               That's cool.

                         LINDA
               His hair is... what is that?

                            CHAD
               Plugs.


31   INT. GYM - NEXT DAY                                             31

     Linda is showing someone around the floor.

                         LINDA
               This is the cardio area. A lot of
               machines here so that, believe me,
               there's never a wait. What you're
               seeing now, this is our busiest time,
               and there's still a couple of open
               treadmills I see, three Stairmasters----
               I call it the Butt-Blaster----couple of
               LifeCycles----Hi, Chad.

     Chad is working with a medicine ball and a heavy young woman.

                            CHAD
               Hi Linda.     Did you call that guy?

                         LINDA
               Not yet! Chad is one of our trainers.
               I've just started internet dating and
               I got my first look at the, uh...

                         CUSTOMER
               What service?

                         LINDA
               BeWithMeDC dot com?

                            CUSTOMER
               Nice.

                         LINDA
               Have you used them?

                                                             25.


                           CUSTOMER
               No----two friends did and they're both
               hooked up. With really special guys.

                         LINDA
               That's fantastic.


32   INT. LINDA'S OFFICE - LATER                                   32

     Linda is leaning forward at her desk, phone wedged between
     ear and shoulder, one hand up at her forehead.

     After a long still beat:

                            LINDA
               Yes!

     Another still beat.

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... English!

     Beat.

                            LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... Agent!

     Beat.

                            LINDA DRIVING
               ... Agent!     Agent!

     Beat.

                         LINDA
               ... Yes, hi, this is Linda Litzke,
               should I give you my account number?
               You have it up? Okay. I was informed
               that I needed pre-approval for these
               surgeries, and then... Yes, it was
               denied.

     Listening, then:

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               ...No, those are four different
               operations... It's very complicated;
               I'm reinventing myself, it's a whole
               new look so it isn't just one thing,
               however, it's all approved by my
               doctor... But----madam! This is not----my
               job involves, you know, public
               interface! This is not...

                                                              26.


     Her jaw sets.   She controls her fury.   Quieter:

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               ... Yes I do understand. Could I
               speak to your supervisor please?


33   INT. TED'S OFFICE/LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY - MINUTES LATER         33

     We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles
     over, of Linda, now slumped at her desk, head in her arms.
     We faintly hear her sobbing.

     Reverse shows Ted Treffon, middle-aged, balding, the soulful
     manager of Hardbodies. He looks at Linda, puzzled and a
     little alarmed. He tenses as if to rise but doesn't, and
     hovers uncomfortably, unsure of whether to intrude.


34   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     34

     Linda walks down the promenade dressed in a smart pant suit.

     Her moving POV passes over a couple in conversation, an old
     woman feeding the birds, a man in a business suit reading a
     newspaper.

     She passes the man and turns around. He has looked up from
     the paper and is staring at her. He wears aviator-shaped
     glasses with clear plastic rims. He may have hair plugs.

                            LINDA
               Alan?

                         MAN (ALAN)
               Are you, uh... Linda?


35   EXT. CIRCLE THEATRE - DUSK                                     35

     A poster advertises Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and
     Claire Danes.


36   INT. THEATRE - NIGHT                                           36

     On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes
     his head to look steeply up and off.

     Linda sits next to Alan in the half-empty theatre, nervously
     watching the screen.

                                                               27.


                         DERMOT (OFF)
               First you tell me that you can't
               commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN
               FROM THERE!

     Linda laughs raucously, then catches herself and looks at
     Alan.


37   INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT                                           37

     The couple sit across from each other at a small table. They
     pick at their food.


38   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT                            38

     The couple are making love in the dark room on a frilly
     comforter. Alan, still wearing his glasses, wheezes
     asthmatically.


39   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT/BEDROOM - LATER                            39

     Alan is snoring. After a long beat Linda gets up and puts on
     a robe. She bends down near the bed and picks something up
     out of Alan's trousers.


40   INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  40

     She sits into a chair near the window in the dark room and
     opens Alan's wallet. A Discover card, driver's license, a
     condom. A photograph of Alan holding a large bluefish.

     She unfolds a piece of notepaper.    Written in a feminine hand
     in pencil:

     Please pick up:
         Plunge
         Honey Nut Cheerios.

                         LINDA
               Oh for Pete's sake!

     She catches herself, looks around.

     The snoring, off, continues.

     She looks out the window.

     The lights of the freeway twinkle.

                                                                 28.


41   INT. YACHT - NIGHT                                                41

     We are in the bedroom.   The boat rides gently at anchor.

     Harry has an arm around Katie, in bed.   Both stare at a point
     in space.

     After a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of
     water against hull:

                           HARRY
               ... and then, you know, you grow up.
               I guess that's what's happened with
               me. You just... people change. We
               married when I was, what, in my mid-
               twenties. A kid. We were kids.
               Twenties. You think it's forever.
               Then, you know, you're older----you
               begin to feel your mortality, you
               start to think, well, there's no more
               time for dishonesty. Subterfuge. You
               go, I'm not that person. The choices
               you made, you can't, just through
               inertia----

                         KATIE
               I'm thinking of divorcing Ozzie.

     Harry doesn't react----a careful, studied non-reaction.   After
     more sloshing:

                         HARRY
               ... I'm just thinking, Whoa. I mean,
               frankly, I'm thinking, Whoa. I, I, I
               guess that's what I should be thinking
               about too. With Sandy.

                         KATIE
               That's what you were just saying.

                         HARRY
               Yes! Absolutely! And you should be
               getting rid of that bozo.  No
               question about that. I agree.

                         KATIE
               So if I were divorced----

                         HARRY
               Well yes, if you were uh, you know,
               yes. Yes, I should settle things.
               With Sandy. Because of you and me.
               It just takes, courage, you know. To
               inflict that pain. Scary stuff.
                         (MORE)

                                                             29.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               Scary stuff. You're a brave lady.
               Well, of course, it would be easier
               for you.

                         KATIE
               Why's that? I don't see that.

                         HARRY
                   (chuckling)
               Well you know, because he's such a
               dope.
                   (sobers)
               But Sandy, she's... a good lady. A
               very special lady.

                         KATIE
               She's a cold, stuck-up bitch.

                         HARRY
               Well that's... a little----

                          KATIE
               You and I should sort things out.
               I've told you that this is not just
               frivolity.

                         HARRY
               No, that's understood.   You've been
               very straight.

                         KATIE
               I thought I was loud and clear.

                         HARRY
               Absolutely. Not just fun and games.

     Awkward beat.   The sloshing of waves.   Harry nods.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... Absolutely.


42   INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY                                         42

     Harry Pfarrer pulls a length of metal tubing from a shelf.
     He sights down it, examines the gauge, hefts it.

     He slides it back in and pulls a length, wider gauge, from
     the shelf below.

                                                              30.


43   EXT. HOME DEPOT - DAY                                             43

     Long lens, hand-held, point-of-view seeming: Harry is pushing
     a red shopping cart through the parking lot. Standing in the
     cart are lengths of metal tubing that he steadies with one
     hand as he pushes.


44   INT. LINDA LITZKE'S CUBICLE - DAY                                 44

     Linda has a hand cupped to her forehead and the phone pressed
     to one ear.

                         LINDA
               English!... Agent!... Agent!...

     After a short beat she hits a button on the phone console and
     cradles the handset. From the speaker we hear:

                           RECORDED VOICE
               ----important to us. Please stay on the
               line for the next available agent.

     Music.

     Linda listens for a moment, then abruptly lifts the handset
     and slams it back down.


45   INT. HARDBODIES - TED'S CUBICLE - DAY                             45

     TRACKING IN ON TED'S CUBICLE

     Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies, stands with
     one hand on the back of his chair----which Chad occupies----and
     one hand on the desktop, looking over Chad's shoulder at a
     computer screen that Chad is scrolling down. Standing behind
     both men is a short Mexican Indian man, also in a Hardbodies
     uniform.

                         CHAD
               Holy shit...

                         LINDA
               Ted, can I talk to you about our
               Mickey Mouse health plan?

     Ted continues to stare at the computer screen in mounting
     alarm. He responds absently to Linda:

                         TED
               Uh-huh... Hang on...

                                  Yellow Revision 8/24/07 31.


                    CHAD
          This is some heavy shit.

                    LINDA
          Is that my date list?

                    CHAD
          No... fuck...

                    LINDA
          You know, I'm trying to reinvent
          myself, and these procedures, which
          are so incredibly not cheap, this
          Micky Mouse HMO is saying they're not,
          they're... What is this?

She is looking at the screen.

                    CHAD
          I can't believe this... This is
          like... intelligence shit.

                    TED
          I am not comfortable with this.

                    LINDA
          What is it?

                    CHAD
          This is, like, I can't believe this
          shit I'm seeing.

                    TED
          Manolo found it.

                    CHAD
          Manolo found this, like, CD just lying
          in a locker. Locker floor. Ladies'
          locker room.

                    MANOLO
          Jus lie-een there.

                    CHAD
          And I'm like, whoa, someone's music or
          what, so I come in here and it's these
          files, man.

                    CHAD
          Like it's talking about SigInt, and
          signals and shit. Which, Signals
          means code, you know.

                    MANOLO
          It was jus lie-een there.

                    CHAD
          Talking about like, section heads
          here, and their names and shit. And
          then these other files are just, like,
          numbers. Arrayed. Numbers and dates
          and numbers... And numbers. I think                  *
          that's the shit, man. The raw
          intelligence.

                    TED
          I am not touching this.    I want this
          out of here.

                    CHAD
          Wul... Throw it out?

                    LINDA
          You can't do that! You should put a
          note up in the ladies' locker room.

                    CHAD
          Put a note up? Highly classified shit
          found, Signals intelligence shit, CIA
          shit? Hello! Did you lose your
          secret CIA shit? I don't think so.

          comfortable with this. I want this                   *
          out of Hardbodies...

As he backs out of the office:

                    TED (CONT'D)
          ... We're running a gym here!

Chad swivels around.

                     CHAD
          Look,   Manolo...

He zippers his lip.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          ...you didn't find this.

                                                                 33.

46   INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                                            46

     CLOSE ON A REAR-VIEW MIRROR

     A dark blue Ford Taurus, three or four car lengths back on a
     quiet Chevy Chase street.

     Harry Pfarrer glances at the rear view mirror. Behind him we
     see the steel pipe from Home Depot laying across the top of
     the back seat of the station wagon.


47   EXT. CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - DAY                                      47

     Harry is just getting out of the wagon which is parked in the
     driveway of the suburban house.


48   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                                  48

     Harry is struggling through the      front door with the length
     of pipe.

     We hear his wife call down from upstairs:

                            SANDY
               Harry?      Is that you?

                         HARRY
               Yeah, yeah, it's me.

     He takes the pipe, opens the staircase door to the cellar,
     sets the pipe inside on the upper stair, and closes the door
     behind him.


49   INT. CELLAR - NIGHT                                               49

     Harry is at a workbench welding a length of trimmed pipe to a
     short piece of hardware clamped in a table vise.

     His home shop is in a caged-off section of the basement.
     There is also haphazard storage.

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 34.


     One shelf holds stacked boxes labeled with magic marker:
     "Oliver in the Oval Office," "Yea and Nay for Oliver,"
     "Point of Order, Oliver!"

     Harry loosens the vise and takes out the piece of hardware.
     He drops it, a small bearing-mounted clip, onto a length of
     pipe held horizontal in another vise. He experimentally
     slides the clip along the length of pipe: it slides smoothly
     back and forth, nicely balanced.


50   INT. MONKEY DAVE'S - NIGHT                                     50

     Linda Litzke and Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of
     Hardbodies, are at a table in the yuppie bar Monkey Dave's.
     To a waitress:

                         LINDA
               Absolut Saketini, please?

                         TED
               Just a Tab.

                         LINDA
               You know, it wouldn't cover all of it,
               but if I got some advance on my salary
               I could at least get the surgery ball
               rolling.

                         TED
               Whoa! There's a payroll company, you
               know. They don't just advance people
               money. They just don't do that. I

               authorize it, but that's not going to
               mean anything to them.

                         LINDA
               Well why do they have us on a
               cockamamie health plan? I need these
               surgeries, Ted!

                         TED
               You're a beautiful woman!   You don't
               need­

                         LINDA
               Ted, I have gone just as far as I can
               go with this body! I----

                         TED
               I think it's a very beautiful----it's
               not a phoney-baloney Hollywood body----

                                    Yellow Revision 8/24/07 35.


                    LINDA
          That's right, Ted, I would be laughed
          out of Hollywood. I have very limited
          breasts and a gi-normous ass and I
          have this gut that swings back and
          forth in front a me like a shopping
          cart with a bent wheel.

                    TED
          Oh come on!

                    LINDA
          I am trying to get back in
          circulation. I have appetites and so
          forth, and, uh----

                    TED
          Well there's a lot of guys who'd like
          you just the way you are.

                      LINDA
          Yeah----losers!

                    TED
          Well, I don't know. Am I a loser?
          Lemme tell you something. I wasn't
          always a manager at Hardbodies. I,
          um...
                                                                  *

He looks at her, appraising.   He decides.

                    TED (CONT'D)                                  *
          Let me show you something.

He reaches into his wallet.    He pulls out a picture:

A snapshot of a soulful man in a dark robe and a high caftan
standing on a curb in front of a large stone building.

Linda shrieks:

                      LINDA
          Omygod----is that you?!

Ted nods gravely.

                    LINDA
          Well jeez, that's a good job!

                    TED
          Mm-hm.

                    LINDA
          What happened?

                    TED
          Well...

He looks at the picture for a sad beat, then shrugs.   He
stuffs it back in his wallet.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          ... It's a long story. Anyway, lotta
          ways I'm happier now. My point is...
          my point is... it's a journey.

                    LINDA
          Well that's my point! I don't want to
          stay where I am! I want to find
          someone to share my journey!

          never gonna see----

          an advance on my salary but you can
          put in a request, can't you?

                    TED
          It's not going to do any good, Linda.

                    LINDA
          Ted, have you ever heard of the power
          of positive thinking?

51   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                  51

     It is night. Linda sleeps in a darkened bedroom under the
     frilly comforter.   We hear a distant banging. Finally the
     banging stops and a moment later the telephone rings.

     Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.

                            LINDA
               Hurrow----

     She removes an appliance from her mouth.

                         LINDA (CONT'D)
               Hello?... Where are you?... Okay.
               Just a second.


52   INT. APARTMENT STAIRWELL - NIGHT                                52

     We hear a door being buzzed open. At the top of the staircase
     an apartment door opens and Linda appears in a robe.

     Her POV down the steep staircase: Chad Feldheimer is walking
     up towards the landing dressed in a black lycra bicycle
     unitard with lime green flames. He holds a bike wheel in one
     hand and a plastic squirt bottle in the other.

     He looks up, foreshortened.

                            CHAD
               Omygod.


53   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER                          53

     Chad enters with his bicycle wheel and squirt bottle.   Linda
     shuts the door behind him.

                            CHAD
               Omygod.

                         LINDA
               Chad, you know what time it is?

                         CHAD
               Uh-huh. So, like, I couldn't tell you
               this on your totally unsecure phone,
               but I know who the guy is.

     He leans his wheel against the wall and sits on a low chair
     that brings his knees up near his chin. He looks smugly at
     Linda.

                                                   38.


                       LINDA
           The guy?

                     CHAD
           The guy, the secret guy.

                     LINDA
           Is he high up?

A beat.   Chad stares.

                     CHAD
           Um. I don't know if he's high up.
           Probably. I mean, I know his name,
           not like his rank.

                     LINDA
           What is it?

                       CHAD
           Osbourne.    Cox.

                     LINDA
           Never heard of him.

                     CHAD
           Oh, like you're so plugged in to the
           intelligence community.

                     LINDA
           I'm just saying, to the layman----

                     CHAD
           Well I think like the quality of the
           intelligence dictates how high up he
           is.

                       LINDA
           Uh-huh.

                     CHAD
           Not what we know.

                       LINDA
           Uh-huh.

                     CHAD
           And I also got his----do you have any
           water? I gotta hydrate.

                     LINDA
           I have tap water

                                                        39.


                    CHAD
          Are you kidding?

                    LINDA
          How did you find out who he is?

                     CHAD
          Sources.

                    LINDA
          What do you mean sources?

                    CHAD
          Do you have like Gatorade? Anything
          besides, like, Maryland swamp water?

He rises and heads for the kitchen.

                    CHAD (CONT'D)
          ... You know how far this is from my
          place?

                    LINDA
          How do you know his name?

                    CHAD
          I have this geek friend, Ernie
          Gallegos? He does computer stuff,
          hooks up people's computers and
          programs their VCRs'n shit? So he
          examines the files and he pulls off
          the digital watermark that tells what
          computer they were created on.
          Fucking child's play for Ernie.

                     LINDA
          Uh-huh.

Chad opens the refrigerator and starts rummaging.

                    CHAD
          I also have his telephone number.
          That was a little harder.

                     LINDA
          Omygod!

Chad straightens up with a bottle of orange juice which he
rolls across his forehead.

                    CHAD
          Shall we give him a tinkle?

               Omygod, why?

                         CHAD
               Because he's gonna wanna know that his
               shit is secure. You know, he's gonna
               be relieved. He might even be so
               relieved he gives us a reward----I would
               be very fucking surprised if he did
               not.

                           LINDA
               Oh, wow.

                         CHAD
               Very surprised. Like, you know, the                            *

               a tax, really, since it's voluntary.


54   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                        54

     Chad is looking at a crumpled piece of notepaper and punching
     numbers into a wall phone. In the background we see Linda
     watching him from the living room couch.

     A beat.

     We hear the call ring through.

     The click of the connection being made, and Chad silently
     gestures, with an upward sweep of his hand, for Linda to pick
     up her extension.

                           CHAD
               Hello?


55   INT. OSBOURNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     55

     He has the phone pressed groggily to his ear.

                           OSBOURNE

          Who is this? What time is it?     Who
          are you?

                    CHAD
          I'm a Good Samaritan. I'm sorry I'm
          calling at such an hour, but I thought
          you might be worried.

                       OSBOURNE
          Worried?

                    CHAD
          About the security.     Of your shit.

A beat.

                    OSBOURNE
          What on earth are you talking about?
          Who am I speaking to?

Katie stirs in bed.

                       KATIE
          Who is it?

                    CHAD

          am perfectly happy to return to you

          about?

               that's worth anything.

               Well they----I... I've no idea how they
               got it.

     Chad paces, shaking his head.

                          CHAD
               But it doesn't sound like he's gonna
               play ball.

                         LINDA
               Oh, he'll play ball! We just have to
               let him know who's boss.

                         CHAD
               Well, that's----he sounds very senior.
               I think this is some senior guy who
               has screwed the pooch, big-time.

                  Yeah, that's why we got him, you know,
                  we've caught him with his thing caught
                  in a big fat wringer.

                              CHAD
                  Yuh-huh.

                            LINDA
                  And us in the driver's seat. This is
                  our opportunity, like, you don't get
                  many of these. You slip on the ice
                  outside of, you know, a fancy
                  restaurant.

                              CHAD
                  Yuh-huh.

                            LINDA
                  Or this happens.

                              CHAD
                  Right.

                            LINDA
                  And right now this has happened.

                             CHAD
                  Yup.   It sure has.

                             LINDA
                  This could put a big dent in my
                  surgeries.

     SANDY PFARRER

     We are dutch on her as she leans down a staircase, one hand
     on its rail, calling to be heard over the buzz of a bandsaw:

                              SANDY
                  Honey!

     No answer.    The bandsaw whines higher, cutting through steel.
     Louder:

                              SANDY (CONT'D)
                  Honey!

                                            Blue Revision 8/1/07 46.


     The whine hums down.

                            HARRY'S VOICE
               Huh?

                         SANDY
               My cab is here, I'm off.      Mystery man.

     Her point-of-view: down the stairs, oddly cropped by the
     angles of dropped ceiling and walls, we see Harry's lower
     body as he throws a drape over his project. He emerges from
     the shop cage and closes its mesh door and padlocks it.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
               ... What is that thing?

                            HARRY
               Oh baby.     Top secret.

     He comes up the stairs, pushing goggles onto his forehead.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... You're gonna knock 'em dead.

     At the top of the stairs he kisses her.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... How many cities?

                         SANDY
               Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles,
               Chicago.

     He picks up her bag and they go out.

                         HARRY
               Why do they always have you do
               Seattle. Not a big market.

                         SANDY
               I don't know, lots of independent
               bookstores. Rains all day, what are
               people gonna do.

                         HARRY
               I can think of a couple of things.

                         SANDY
               You can think of one thing.

                         SANDY
               It better be the Peninsula. The money
               I make for them. Are you gonna be
               okay?

                         HARRY
               I'll be sad. But I'll be okay.

                         SANDY
               Not too sad..

                         HARRY
               Just the right amount.

     He kisses her.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... I am crazy about you, baby.

     He slams the car door after her. As the car pulls out his
     look travels with it and then lingers up the street, caught
     on:

     A Ford Taurus, parked, dark.

     Harry hesitates, then starts walking up the street towards
     the parked car.

     When he has taken several steps the ignition is turned in the
     car. A shape briefly visible in the driver's seat is lost
     when the headlights flash on. The car pulls out from the
     curb into a U-turn and drives away.

     Harry watches the tail lights recede.

               So. We've drawn up the papers and are
               prepared to execute service on
               Osbourne if you so elect, Mrs. Cox.
               Our missiles are pointed at his
               capital, so to speak, and we await
               only your word. But, be mindful,
               madam: once these missiles are
               launched, there is no recalling them.
               We are not picking daisies. We are
               declaring war, and hostilities will
               then impose their own logic. I think
               you understand what I'm saying.

               Mr. Terikhian, I have given my husband

                         BOGUS
               Of course. But since we are at the
               point of no return, I always urge my
               clients at this juncture to give it
               one more day of reflection.

                          KATIE
               Yes.   Understood.


63   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                      63

     Linda walks down the promenade, dressed in a smart pant suit.

     Her moving POV passes over people relaxing in the park: a
     mother with a stroller, kids running with a ball. Her look
     settles on the bench that formerly held her first date, now
     occupied by:

     A man spitting sunflower seeds.   Harry Pfarrer.

     The point-of-view arcs past him as Linda gives him the once-
     over.

     She doubles back.

                           LINDA
               Harry?    I'm Linda.

               Yeah, I did the whole bodyguard thing
               for years. My guy was in State, the
               Secretary in fact, so of course I
               traveled a lot.

     Harry talks into his sleeve-cuff as if into a radio
     transmitter:

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ..."Ironside is leaving the building."
               We called him Iron Ass.

          ... Not to his face, of course.     Not
          to his ass, either!

Linda cackles again; Harry smiles.

65   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                 65

     Linda swings the door open, leading Harry in.

     Harry talks as he looks appraisingly around the apartment.

                           HARRY
               ----but there was just a hell of a lot
               of political infighting, petty, petty,
               shit, and then basically the old man
               stepped on Goldberger's throat.
               Nice...

     He is evaluating the place.   He stamps on the floor.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... Wide-plank pine?

                          LINDA
               I guess.

     Harry is taking off his coat.

                         HARRY
               Listen, full disclosure here Linda...

     He holds up both hands and waggles the fingers.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... I'm not wearing a wedding ring but
               I am married. Took the ring off,
               what, eighteen months ago when we
               agreed to separate. Agreed to
               disagree. That's about the only thing
               we ever agreed on.

     Linda cackles.

                                                               52.

               Thanks for telling me.     I really do
               appreciate it, Harry.

               Well, full transparency, the only way
               to----

     As Linda passes he grabs and embraces her.    Linda reacts to
     his gun in the shoulder holster:

                         LINDA
               That's not gonna go off, is it?

                         HARRY

               That's great. That sounds...
               exciting.

     Wider shows Linda in the manager's cubicle.

                         LINDA
               He's very very communicative. Very
               accessible. He has a sense of humor.
               And he agrees one hundred percent
               about my surgeries.

                             TED
               Well, I----

                           LINDA
               He thinks my ass could be smaller. I
               mean, not in a mean way, he kidded
               about it----he's got a terrific sense of
               humor.

                         TED
               That's good, but... but... Linda, what
               do you really know about this guy?

                         LINDA
               I told you, he's in the Treasury
               Department and he----

                                                                53.


                            TED
               But he could be one of these people
               who, you know, who cruises the
               internet----

                         LINDA
               Yeah, so am I!

     A rattling knock.   Linda looks over:

     Chad Feldheimer, in his trainer's polo shirt, is knocking on
     the cubicle window. He gestures urgently for her to come
     out.

     Behind Hardbodies. Linda and Chad emerge from the health
     club through a heavy back door.

                         LINDA
               No, you can't go like that!     You gotta
               wear a suit.

                           CHAD
               Well----you mean----go home and change?

                            LINDA
               Yeah!

                         CHAD
               I was gonna ride my bike.     Do I have
               time?


68   INT. DOWNTOWN RESTAURANT - DAY                                   68

     Harry and Katie are at a downtown D.C. restaurant in the
     middle of lunch.

                           KATIE
               ----which to my mind is all the more
               reason to lower the boom on Ozzie.

                            HARRY
               Mm.

                            KATIE
               That's it?     "Mm"?

                         HARRY
               I'm just... wondering if it's the
               right time.

                                                         54.


                    KATIE
          Of course it's the right time.   Why
          wouldn't it be the right time.   Does
          it threaten you?

                    HARRY
          No no. No, you and me are rock solid.
          That's why I, uh, I think we can
          afford to be big. We can think about
          Ozzie, whether maybe we should let him
          get himself together a little before
          you hammer him with, um----

                    KATIE
          Is that how you see me, "hammering"
          him?

                    HARRY
          Of course not, but----

                    KATIE
          Weren't those your words?

                         HARRY
          Yes, but----

                    KATIE
          I don't "hammer."

                      HARRY
          No, uh-huh, of course not. But, I'm
          saying----I'm no friend of the guy. You
          know that. I think he's an arrogant
          little geek. But for Christ sakes,
          you and me have all the time in the
          world, and he just lost his job----

                    KATIE
          He didn't lose it, he quit.

                    HARRY
          Yeah. Most of the people who "quit"
          in this town were fired.

Katie looks at Harry, reckoning.   He returns her look with an
open one.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... I feel sorry for the guy. And
          he'll be easier to deal with when he
          doesn't feel... cornered.

                                                                 55.


                         KATIE
               Maybe. As long as we're talking about
               Ozzie and not you.

                         HARRY
               Of course we're talking about Ozzie.
               Baby, I stand by you whatever you do.
               I adore you.

     She nods, thinking, still gazing at him.   Her cell phone
     chirps and she reaches into her purse.

                         KATIE
               Please get the check.

     She flips open the phone.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               ...Yes?... Yes?... Is there blood in
               his stool?...Yes, soon.

     She looks at her watch, rises.

                         KATIE (CONT'D)
               It's after two. I have to get back to
               work.

     Harry rises to kiss her.

                         HARRY
               I love you so much.


69   INT./EXT. COX'S CAR/STREET - DAY                                  69

     CLOSE ON A WATCH

     Showing 2:20.

     Wider shows Osbourne Cox, sitting in a car parked on a
     downtown street, consulting his watch.

     He looks up, irritated, and glances around.   His look is
     arrested by:

     The side-view mirror. It shows a man approaching on bicycle
     along the sidewalk wearing a suit and a bike helmet. The man
     dismounts several paces behind the parked car, locks his bike
     to a fence separating the sidewalk from a small park, and
     takes off his helmet. It is Chad.

     He walks along the sidewalk to the car, opens the passenger
     door and sits in with his bike helmet clamped under one arm.

                                                      56.


                    CHAD
          Osbourne Cox?

                    OSBOURNE
          And you, I take it, are "Mr. Black"?

                      CHAD
          Yes I am.    You have the money?

                    OSBOURNE
          The fifty-thousand dollars.

                    CHAD
          That's what was agreed upon, Osbourne
          Cox.

                    OSBOURNE
          All right. Let me explain something
          to you, "Mr. Black." You know who I
          am; I know who you are.

                     CHAD
              (smug)
          Perhaps. But appearances can be----
          deceptive.

                    OSBOURNE
          Yeah. What you're engaged in is
          blackmail, which is a felony. That's
          for starters.

                    CHAD
          Appearances can be----deceptive.   I am a
          mere Good Samar----

                    OSBOURNE
          Secondly, the unauthorized
          dissemination of classified material
          is a federal crime. If you ever
          carried out your proposed threat, you
          would experience such a shitstorm of
          consequences, my friend, it would make
          your empty little head spin faster
          than your Schwinn bicycle over there.

Chad chuckles.

                    CHAD
          You think that's a Schwinn?

                    OSBOURNE
          Now give me the fucking floppy or the
          CD or whatever the fuck you have it
          on, and I will----

                                                                57.


                         CHAD
               As soon as you give me the money,
               dickwad! I'm not----Huhgf!

     Osbourne has punched him in the nose.

     Chad stares at him, stunned.

     His nose starts bleeding.

                         CHAD (CONT'D)
               ... You fuck!

                         OSBOURNE
               Give it to me, fuck!

                            CHAD
               You fuck!     You fucker!

     He opens the car door and gets out, hand to his nose.

     He slams the door.


70   EXT. STREET/COX'S CAR - DAY                                      70

     As Chad goes over to his bike Osbourne leans across the front
     seat and cranks down the passenger window to bellow:

                         OSBOURNE
               I know who you are, fucker!

     He pulls out.

                         CHAD
               You're the fucker!

     There is the honk of a car horn----not Osbourne's.

     Chad looks, surprised.    Linda is pulling up.   Her passenger
     window rolls down.

                         LINDA
               Where's the money?

                            CHAD
               He hit me!

                         LINDA
               Where's the money?!

                         CHAD
               He didn't give it to me­

                                                                     58.


                               LINDA
                   Oh, for----Get in!

      Chad does.

                             CHAD
                   That fucker!


71    INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY                                   71

      He is thrown back against the seat as Linda floors it.
      Recovering:

                               CHAD
                   ... Hey----what're you----

      Linda is coming up fast behind Osbourne's car in traffic.

                               CHAD (CONT'D)
                   Oh shit!

      The crash of impact----ramming Osbourne.


72    INT. OSBOURNE'S CAR/EXT. STREET - DAY                                72

      He recoils from the impact.

                             OSBOURNE
                   Holy fucking----you fucking morons!

      The follow car is speeding up again----but it doesn't hit him.
      It swerves out, screeching, to pass, and Linda angrily flips
      him the finger as she speeds by.

                             LINDA
                   That'll give him something to think
                   about.

      Chad is chuckling.      Suddenly he sobers.

                             CHAD
                   Wait, wait! We gotta go back!

      Linda's jaw is set.      The car is ripping through traffic.

                          LINDA
                I knew this would happen.

                          CHAD
                We gotta go back!     My bike!

                          LINDA
                It's on to Plan B.

                          LINDA
                Some people!

      A skidding turn sends his weight against the door, and the
      car lurches to a halt.

                          CHAD
                ... What is this?

                          LINDA

74    INT. EMBASSY RECEPTION - DAY                                    74

      Linda stands before a reception desk. Chad is just behind
      her, his shirt front spotted with blood and his head tipped
      back with one hand pressing a hankie to his nose. His bike
      helmet is clamped under his other arm.

                          LINDA
                I told Mr. Krapkin I might be stopping                      *

                          CHAD
                Is there a men's room?

                                                               60.


75   INT. MR. KRAPOTKIN'S OFFICE - DAY                               75

     Linda and Chad sit in, Chad with a moistened hand-towel now
     pressed to his nose.

     Behind the desk sits a sixtyish Russian functionary with the
     beetle-browed sphynx-like look of the Brezhnev-era
     bureaucrat. This is Krapotkin.

                           KRAPOTKIN
               ----Not exactly. I am assistant
               cultural attaché. The organs of state

               ... The organs of state security?

                         KRAPOTKIN
               Yes.

                         LINDA
               But if I had, oh, say, secrets of a
               highly, um, secrets that would
               interest the organs of state
               security...

     She trails off, nodding encouragingly at Krapotkin.
     Krapotkin looks blankly back.

     A long beat.

                         KRAPOTKIN
               Yes.

     She rummages in her handbag and pulls out the diskette. She
     holds it aloft, waggling it for Krapotkin.

     Krapotkin stares.

     Linda sets the diskette on the table and slides it across.

                         LINDA
               ... This is just a taste.

     After a beat of looking at the proffered diskette, Krapotkin
     leans forward to take it. Linda smiles. Krapotkin turns the
     diskette over a couple of times, looks sadly up.

                         KRAPOTKIN
               May I ask the source of this...

     Linda slowly shakes her head, eyes locked on Krapotkin.

            Very high up.

            Chad!

                      CHAD
            I'm just saying he's high up!

A large drop of blood has gathered at the tip of Chad's nose.
It now drops onto his shirt.

Silence.

Finally:

            Could you wait please?

He rises.

                          LINDA
            Well----

She looks anxiously at her watch.

                      LINDA (CONT'D)
            ... I have a date----

Krapotkin leaves.

When the door closes behind him:

                          LINDA (CONT'D)                            *
            The fish.      Has bitten.                              *

                          CHAD                                      *
            What?      Oh, yeah.   Yeah, he seems cool.

A long beat.      Linda looks at her watch.

Chad sighs.

                      CHAD (CONT'D)
            ... That fucker really hit me.

                                                                62.


76   INT. MR. KRAPOTKIN'S OFFICE - DAY - MANY MINUTES LATER             76

     Chad is slumped back with his head tilted back.     Linda looks
     at her watch.

     The door opens.     A man in a suit:

                            MAN
                  Could you accompany me please?

                              LINDA
                  Well----okay...


77   INT. EMBASSY HALLWAY - DAY                                         77

     The three people----Linda, Chad, the man in the suit----walking.
     Linda gazes around; Chad has his head mostly back.


78   INT. ANOTHER EMBASSY OFFICE - DAY                                  78

     Vladimir Putin glares down from a framed photograph on the
     wall. Chad and Linda are sitting before yet another man, even
     blander than the first.

                            NEW EMBASSY MAN
                  Can you tell me where this material
                  comes from?

     Linda makes a pantomime of zipping her lip.

     The man looks at her impassively.

                            CHAD
                  Name, rank and serial number.

     The Russian's focus shifts to the man with the bloody nose:

                               NEW EMBASSY MAN
                  Excuse me?

                            CHAD
                  We, um... we know our rights.

     The man stares at him.       A beat.

                            LINDA
                  This is just a taste.

     The man's look swings back to the woman for another staring
     beat.

     At length:

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 63.


                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               There is more material?

                         LINDA
               There's a lot more.    But we need to be
               paid.

                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               You are not ideological.

     A beat.

                         CHAD
               I don't think so.

                         LINDA
               Look, I have a date.

                           NEW EMBASSY MAN
               Hm?

     Linda holds up her watch and taps at it:

                           LINDA
               Date.

     The man sighs.

                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               ... We will examine the material.   How
               do I contact?

                         LINDA
               We work at the Hardbodies in
               Alexandria.

                         CHAD
               I'm at 1442 Westerly----

                         LINDA
               Chad, not your home address!

     Beat.

                         NEW EMBASSY MAN
               So... I call Hardbodies, I ask for...
               Chad?

                           LINDA
               No.    Linda.                                             *

     TED TREFFON

     Point-of-view from a car pulling into Hardbodies. Ted
     Treffon, the soulful manager, stands on the sidewalk in front
     of the gym, squinting into the approaching car, his arms out
     to either side, palms up: what the hell is going on?


80   INT. TED'S CUBICLE - DAY                                        80

     Minutes later.

                         TED
               A line to check in, towels piling up.

                            LINDA
               I'm sorry.

                         TED
               Manolo running around like crazy----what
               happened to your nose?

                            CHAD
               I just----

                         TED
               This is not acceptable at Hardbodies.
               You two know better than that.

                            LINDA
               Yes we do.     I'm sorry, Ted.

                         TED
               This is no way.

                         CHAD
               It was unavoidable.    This won't happen
               again.

     A considering beat.

                         TED
               But you won't tell me what's going on.

                         LINDA
               We can't. I... I... Ted, I know this
               is terrible, but----I have to run. I
               have a date.

     Ted looks at her dolefully.

                         TED
               You're changing, Linda.

     He shakes his head.

                          TED (CONT'D)
                ... Very sad.


81   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - OSBOURNE'S CAR - DAY                       81 *

     The car is parked in the driveway of the Cox townhouse, its
     back crumpled.

     Reverse shows Katie, looking at it, furious, her jaw set.


82   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                        82 *

     Katie marches in the door.

                          KATIE
                Ozzie! Goddamnit, Ozzie, what have
                you done to the car?!

     Silence.


83   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                          83 *

     Katie enters.

                            KATIE
                Ozzie!

     Osbourne, lightly sheened by sweat, is in the easy chair in
     his robe, his microcassette recorder under the hand splayed
     across his chest. Amber fluid puddles a glass on the side
     table. Osbourne snores softly.

     Katie's fury mounts.    She visibly fights it down.

                          KATIE (CONT'D)
                ... All right. All right.


84   INT. PFARRER BATHROOM - DAY                                     84 *

     In Harry Pfarrer's house. Harry stands before the mirror
     humming as he meticulously trims his eyebrow hair with a
     Hoffritz scissors.

     We hear his phone ringing, then the answering machine:

                          HARRY'S VOICE
                Sandy and I aren't here to take your
                call. Please leave a message.

                                          Blue Revision 8/1/07 66.


     After a beep:

                         KATIE'S VOICE
               Can I see you please. Harry, please
               call me. I'm very upset.

     Harry continues to hum, trimming his eyebrows.   The machine
     beeps off.


85   INT. PFARRER LIVING ROOM - DAY                                  85 *

     Harry walks into the living room. He takes some as-yet-
     unfolded packing boxes and strews them with studied
     randomness across the floor. As he does so we hear a cell
     phone chirp.

     Harry fishes the phone out of his pocket and holds it at
     arm's length, squinting at the number. Still humming, he
     stuffs the phone back in his pocket.


86   EXT. STREET/CIRCLE THEATRE - NIGHT                              86

     Linda meets Harry with a kiss.

                          LINDA
               I'm sorry----am I late?

                         HARRY
               No no, doesn't start for five minutes.

     He is escorting to a movie theater entrance.

                         HARRY (CONT'D)
               ... You haven't seen this, have you?

                          LINDA
               Oh!   No, no I haven't.

     Our follow-move brings in a light box displaying the one-
     sheet for Totally Stoked! with Dermot Mulroney and Claire
     Danes.

     As they tail out of frame:

                         HARRY
               I hear it's terrific.


87   INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                         87

     On the screen, Dermot Mulroney, dressed in a tuxedo, cranes
     his head to look steeply up and off.

                                                                 67.


                         DERMOT
               First you tell me that you can't
               commit, then you----WOULD YOU GET DOWN
               FROM THERE!

     Along with Linda, Harry laughs raucously, tossing popcorn
     into his mouth.


88   INT. HARRY'S CHEVY CHASE HOUSE - NIGHT                            88

     The door swings in and Harry and Linda enter.      Harry refers
     to the boxes littering the floor:

                         HARRY
               Pardon our dust, I, uh----the ex is in
               the process of moving out. Damn! I
               told her I wanted to expedite this.

                         LINDA
               Uh-huh.

                         HARRY
               We, uh, you know you try to act like
               an adult.

                         LINDA
               Oh, it's never easy.

                          HARRY
               Oh! Come on downstairs.    Do you like
               surprises?

                         LINDA
               Well, I'm very open to new
               experiences...


89   INT. PFARRER BASEMENT - NIGHT                                     89

     The overhead light is switched on.

     As Harry and Linda come down the stairs:

                           HARRY
               I gotta tell ya----I saw an ad for this
               in a gentleman's magazine----twelve
               hundred bucks. I take a look at this
               thing, I think, Jesus, you gotta be
               kidding----I'm a hobbyist, this is
               basically nothing but speed-rail, I
               could probably go to Home Depot and
               whip this up myself for, like, a
               hundred bucks...

                                                             68.


     He sweeps the drop-cloth off his project.

     It looks like a rowing machine, though with a higher seat.
     Its function is obscure.

                            LINDA
                  ... What is it?

                             HARRY
                      (smug)
                  What is it. You siddown, feet in the
                  stirrups, and...

     He pushes the seat with his foot. It slides forward then
     back, forward and back, rocking. On its forward arc a dildo
     emerges from the center of the seat's pipe-track, angled
     toward the seat-bottom which is cleft to accommodate its
     entrance.

     A long beat as the seat squeaks back and forth, the dildo
     rhythmically bobbing up and down.

     At length:

                              LINDA
                  Omygod!

     Another couple of cycles.

                            LINDA (CONT'D)
                  ... It's fantastic!

                            HARRY
                  Isn't that somethin'? Hundred bucks
                  all-in if you don't count my labor.
                  And the, you know----cost of the dildo.
                  Those things are not cheap.

                              LINDA
                  Uh-uh.

                            HARRY
                  But I lack the, uh, I'm not set up to
                  mold hard rubber.

     Both stare at the rocking love seat:

     Squeak.   Squeak.      Squeak.


90   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                              90

CLOSE ON OSBOURNE

Sitting in a bar booth, staring, incredulous.

                    OSBOURNE
          ... The Russians?

Across from him, a man of Osbourne's age.

                       MAN (HAL)
          Uh-huh.

                    OSBOURNE
          The Russians?

                      HAL
          Uh-huh.    Russian Embassy, yeah.

Osbourne stares.

                    OSBOURNE
          ... You're sure?

                    HAL
          Hey, the guy was not hard to follow.
          As you know.

                     OSBOURNE
          Why the FUCK would they go to the
          Russians?!

The man responds only with a shrug and a commiserating head-
shake.

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ... Why the FUCK...

Osbourne struggles to compose himself.

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ... I'm sorry. Thank you, Hal.

                       HAL
          Hey.     No problemo.

He leans in, voice lowered.

                    HAL (CONT'D)
          ... Ozzie, I hate to be the paranoid
          old spook, but those two guys seem
          very interested in you.

Osbourne looks.

                                                         70.


                    HAL (CONT'D)
          ...You haven't gone poofy on me, have
          ya Oz?

There are two men with drinks at a booth. At Osbourne's look
one of them, who has been staring, looks hastily away.

                    OSBOURNE
              (sharply)
          Can I help you?

The man meets his look again.   He smiles, rises, ambles over.

                    MAN (PROCESS SERVER)
          Sorry to stare, I just couldn't place
          the... You're Princeton, aren't you?
          My year? '73?

                    OSBOURNE
              (softening)
          Yeah.

                    PROCESS SERVER
          I just didn't remember your...

Osbourne extends a hand.

                    OSBOURNE
          Osbourne Cox.

                    PROCESS SERVER
          Thought so.

He smiles as he deposits a large manila envelope in
Osbourne's extended hand.

          ... Served...

He nods toward his companion, watching from the booth.

                    PROCESS SERVER (CONT'D)
          ... and witnessed. Have a good
          evening.

The man walks off; his friend hastily knocks back the rest of
his drink and rises to follow him.

Osbourne stares stupidly at the envelope in his hand.

                    HAL
          Ouch.

                                                             71.


91   INT. COX'S CAR/EXT. COX'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT                    91

     THRU A WINDSHIELD

     Night.    Rain.

     The car corners into a driveway and its headlights rake the
     front of the Cox townhouse, which is dark. A couple of
     pieces of luggage and several cardboard boxes are stacked on
     the stoop, most of them protected from the rain by the eave
     but some not.

                           OSBOURNE'S VOICE
                 What the fuck?

     OUTSIDE

     The car stops. Osbourne emerges, runs through the rain to
     the front stoop. Rain drums against cardboard.

                           OSBOURNE
                 What the fuck?

     He puts his key in the lock and----it doesn't turn.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... Fucking...

     He nudges a cardboard box with his toe.

     He looks up at the dark house, squinting against the rain.


92   INT. JAMBA JUICE - DAY                                         92

     Linda and Chad sit at the counter, Linda drinking a large
     protein shake, Chad idly twirling a straw wrapper around one
     finger.

                           CHAD
                 Why did you tell him we could get more
                 stuff?

                           LINDA
                 Well maybe we can.

                           CHAD
                 That's all Manolo found! That was
                 everything! What're we, gonna tell
                 Manolo to scoop some more secret shit
                 off the locker room floor!

                           LINDA
                 Hey!

                        Yellow Revision 8/24/07 72.


            CHAD
What.

          LINDA
I don't like the snideness!    Nor the                *
negativity!

           CHAD
    (abashed)
I'm sorry.

          LINDA
I'm just trying to work this thing!
If I'm going to reinvent myself I need
those surgeries. And those surgeries
cost money! This is not just fun and
games!

           CHAD
Yuh-huh.   I'm sorry.

          LINDA
So let's figure this thing out!

          PUBLIC ADDRESS
Chad, your Berry Blast is ready.

          LINDA
We know who he is

          CHAD
Right: Osbourne Cox.

          LINDA
So we can find out where he lives,
right?

            CHAD
Um.    I guess.

          LINDA
You should change.   Into your suit.

            CHAD
Why?

          LINDA
So you don't look out of place in the
neighborhood. There are certain
elementary things.

          CHAD
His neighborhood?

                                      Yellow Revision 8/24/07 73.


                         LINDA
               Yes. We'll remove the laundry marks
               and labels. And you should not be
               carrying ID.

                         CHAD
               Laundry marks?                                               *

                         LINDA
               Deniability.

                            CHAD
               Okay.

                         PUBLIC ADDRESS
               Chad, your Berry Blast is waiting.


93   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                          93

     LONG LENS POINT-OF-VIEW

     A car is pulling into the driveway.   Katie Cox emerges from
     the driver's side.

     Reverse shows Chad, in his suit, watching from a parked car
     across the street.

     Now Harry Pfarrer emerges from the passenger side wearing a
     brown pin-striped suit. Encumbered by something bulky he
     follows Katie up the walk.

     It seems to be some kind of pillow or cushion under his arm,
     but very large, and wedge-shaped. Katie is letting herself
     in; Harry gives a furtive glance around----as Chad sinks back
     in his car seat----before entering with the wedge-cushion.

     The door closes.

     Chad relaxes, straightens up.   A beat.   He looks idly around.
     He notices:

     Another car, parked on the same side of the street, further
     up. Someone is just straightening from a slouch to become
     visible over the driver's headrest.

     Chad looks, puzzled.


94   INT. CAR/EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY - LATER                         94

     Chad is sucking the dregs of his Jamba Juice up a straw when
     a noise brings his look around:

                                                               74.


     The door to the townhouse is opening. Katie emerges, in a
     change of clothes. Harry follows in sweats.

     They get into her car.   It pulls out.

     Chad watches it go up the street.    He is about to open his
     door but pauses, seeing:

     The parked car up the street. Katie's car having passed, it
     now pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. Both cars
     disappear.

     Chad opens his door and gets out. He is crossing to the
     townhouse when he notices another car parked on the other
     side of the street. A man sits in the driver's seat,
     smoking.

     Chad proceeds on to the house. There is a barred garden-
     level door tucked under the stoop. Chad checks out the
     caging on the door. He looks up the façade of the house.


95   INT. KATIE'S CAR/EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY                      95

     It pulls over at one end of the Potomac bridge that we have
     seen before. Harry emerges.

                         HARRY
               What's the odometer say?

                         KATIE
               Five.

                           HARRY
               About five or approximately five?    I
               mean----about f----

                         KATIE
               For fuck's sake, Harry, it's five
               miles. Five point two.

                         HARRY
               Okay, fine----I gotta do at least five.
               Five and a deuce is okay.

                         KATIE
               I'm surprised you have any energy
               left.

                         HARRY
               You kiddin'----pull around the corner
               we'll do it again in back!

                                                                 75.


                          KATIE
                You are very coarse.

                          HARRY
                No, back of the car.   I didn't mean a
                rear-entry, uh----

                           KATIE
                Ach.   I'm late----

      The car squeals away, leaving Harry on the shoulder.


96    EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         96

      Chad is cornering the house on the driveway side, appraising.
      A low wall separates driveway from back garden. Chad gives a
      quick glance around.


97    EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY                           97

      Chad vaults the wall to land in the garden.

      The garden steps down to a back door. Chad checks out the
      windows in back, then goes to the door. It is locked. It
      has a large window.


98    INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BACK WINDOW - DAY                           98

      We can see Chad's form outside the door.   Its pane is tapped
      once... twice... it breaks.


99    EXT. POTOMAC BRIDGE - DAY                                        99

      HARRY JOGGING

      He spins, jogs backward.

      His point-of-view: a car, traveling slowly.   Following?

      Harry cuts across a park lawn.


100   INT. TOWNHOUSE BASEMENT - DAY                                    100

      Chad is nosing around the basement.   He notices Ozzie's
      office set-up.


101   EXT. STREET NEAR PARK - DAY                                      101

                                                                 76.


      HARRY

      Emerging from the park onto another street. He looks around
      and, satisfied that he has lost the tail, jogs on.


102   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY                              102

      Chad is looking at the screen of Ozzie's computer.

      He fishes a CD out of his suit pocket, feeds it into the
      computer.


103   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY                                    103

      HARRY

      Jogging, entering a residential area.


104   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                         104

      Chad is emerging from the basement. He is looking idly
      around, heading toward the front door when a shape
      materializes in its frosted glass sidelight.

      Chad freezes.

      There is scraping at the lock.

      Chad quickly mounts the stairs.


105   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                          105

      Chad freezes, listening.

      The downstairs door swings open, shut.

      Footsteps.

      A tread on the stairs: Chad scurries into the first open
      door.


106   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY                               106

      Chad hotfoots into a closet and eases its door most of the
      way shut. The footsteps mount the stairs. Chad peeks out.

      His POV: The bed, bedclothes rumpled.    In the middle of the
      bed, a wedge-cushion.

                                                           77.


Beyond, the open bedroom door shows a slice of hallway and
stairs. Harry arrives at the top of the stairs. He nudges
back a drape on the window at the top of the steps. He looks
down one way, then the other. He lets the drape fall back
and seems to relax.

Harry enters the bedroom. He strips off his shirt and steps
out of his pants on his way into the bathroom off the master
bedroom. He leaves the door open.

Chad reaches gingerly for the closet door to close it but
stops abruptly as we hear the shower turned off and the
curtain whipped back. Harry emerges from the shower. He
rinses off, humming "Born Free," and walks into the
foreground pulling on shorts and shirt and a pair of dress
pants that was draped across a bureau.

Chad shrinks back into the closet as Harry approaches.     Harry
stops, just outside the cracked door.

Through the crack we see only the white of his shirt.
Abruptly Harry turns his back to us and recedes into the room
and bends to pick something off the floor.

Chad leans in ever so slightly to see, but draws back again
as Harry approaches.

Chad looks over to his right: on a hanger, the brown
pinstripe coat that matches Harry's pants.

The closet door is thrown open.

                     CHAD
          Nuhhh!

                    HARRY
          AHHHHHHHHHH!

Harry jerks up the gun which he's pulled from the shoulder
holster in his other hand and----BAM----shoots Chad in the face.

The gun bucks. Unused to the recoil and still screaming,
Harry staggers back and trips over the edge of the bed and
drops the weapon.

He crabs briefly backward and then flips over and scrambles
off on all fours. In the hallway he rises and tramples down
the stairs.

                                                                78.


107   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BOTTOM OF STAIRS - DAY                     107

      He stops at the bottom of the steps, panting. He looks back
      up the steps, trying to control his heavy breathing so that
      he can listen.

      A long silence.

                                HARRY
                   ... Hello?

      No answer.

      He looks around.


108   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                              108

      Harry enters.    He opens a drawer, closes it, opens another.


109   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY                                109

      Harry enters from the kitchen and starts slowly mounting the
      stairs, a chopping knife in one hand.

                                HARRY
                   ... Hello?


110   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - DAY                         110

      Harry tops the stairs.       He pauses, looking at:

      The bedroom door, ajar.

      Inside, his gun lies on the floor.

      Harry takes cautious steps toward the door.

      He pauses at the cracked door.      Suddenly:

                                HARRY
                   Hungh!

      He plunges through the door and runs for the gun and scoops
      it, dropping the knife.

      He stands and spins, panting.

      His point-of-view: the closet. Its door ajar. Legs protrude
      into the room as if Chad, hidden within, is sitting with his
      back against the closet wall contemplating his next move.

                                                             79.


Harry walks cautiously over. With a bare foot he
experimentally waggles one of Chad's feet. Limp.

Harry nudges the door.

                       HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Hello?

It creaks fully open.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod. Omygod.

Chad's face is a powder-burned, chewed-up mess.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod who are you. You fucker.
          Omygod.

He gingerly crouches down.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... You fucker...

He tries to avert his eyes as he feels in Chad's suit
pockets.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod, my god... Ungh...

He comes away with a wallet and hastily stands.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Omygod...

Inside are a few dollars and nothing else: no credit cards,
driver's license; empty.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... What the fuck...

He leans back in, trying not to look, but for some reason
feeling obliged to return the wallet.

As he opens the suit coat to slip it back in the inside
pocket he notices:

The suit label has been cut away.       He fingers the raveled
fringe.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Oh my fuck...

He straightens up again.

                                                              80.


                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... I killed a fucking spook.    You
                fucker...

      He gazes down at the body.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... What are you doing here, you
                fucker.


111   INT. CIA HALLWAY - DAY                                          111

      We track at floor level, following the well shined shoes of
      someone walking down the well polished hallway.


112   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              112

      We are low, outside an office door. The shoes enter frame
      and the door is swung inward, away from us, to show Palmer
      DeBakey Smith seated behind his desk.

      He looks up.

                            PALMER
                Olson.    What's up.

      The door slams shut.


113   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - DOOR/PALMER'S OFFICE - DAY              113

      Some time later.    Our camera position is higher.

      At the cut the door swings open and Palmer Smith strides out,
      grim-faced.


114   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY                    114

      Tracking behind his shoes down a different piece of hallway.


115   INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - ANOTHER DOOR/CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY       115

      Palmer Smith's back enters and he swings the door open. A
      silver-haired man looks up from his desk where he is leaned
      back, eating orange sections off a paper towel on the
      desktop.

                            MAN
                Palmer.    What's up.

                                                        81.


                    PALMER
          Not quite certain, sir, but it's...
          messy.

He seats himself facing the desk. A desktop nameplate
identifies his superior as Gardner McC. Chubb.

Palmer hands a folder across, grimacing.

                    PALMER (CONT'D)
          ... Kolyma-2 tells us that they have
          computer files from an ex-analyst of
          mine, Osbourne Cox.

                       GARDNER CHUBB
          Kolyma-2?

                    PALMER
          Our man in the Russian Embassy.

                       GARDNER CHUBB
          Mm.

                    PALMER
          It was brought to them by a woman
          who----

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          The Russians?

                    PALMER
          Yeah. It was brought in by Linda
          Litzke, an associate of a guy named
          Harry Pfarrer. Picture's in the
          folder. With Pfarrer's.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          The Russians.

                       PALMER
          Yeah.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Who's Pfarrer?

                    PALMER
          Treasury agent who's been, um,
          screwing Mrs. Cox. Must be how they
          got the files. Or maybe Ozzie knows
          about it, they all seem to be sleeping
          with each other.

                       GARDNER CHUBB
          All right.     Spare me.

                                                        82.


                    PALMER
          Yes sir. But this Treasury guy----it's
          gotten... complicated. He just shot
          somebody in Ozzie's house.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Shot----your analyst?

Palmer shakes his head.

                    PALMER
          Ozzie wasn't there. Our man surveying
          hears a gunshot, sees the Treasury guy
          wrestle something into his car,
          follows him; he dumps a body in the
          Chesapeake Bay.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Well----what'd he do that for?

                    PALMER
          Don't know sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Oh for Christ sake. Anyone fish the
          body out?

                     PALMER
          Mm-hm.

                     GARDNER CHUBB
          Russian?   American?

                    PALMER
          Don't know. Scrubbed of ID.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          And this... Linda...?

                    PALMER
          Linda Litzke.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          She's Treasury?

                     PALMER
          No, we're----um... fuzzy on her.

Gardner Chubb is flipping bemusedly through the contents of
the folder.

                        GARDNER CHUBB
          Well----so----we don't really know what
          anyone is after.

                                                             83.


                          PALMER
                Not really, sir.

                          GARDNER CHUBB
                This analyst, ex-analyst, uh...

                            PALMER
                Cox.

                            GARDNER CHUBB
                Yeah.    What's his clearance level.

                            PALMER
                Three.

                            GARDNER CHUBB
                Okay.    Okay, no biggie...

      He reaches the folder back to Palmer.

                          GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
                ... for now just keep an eye on
                everyone, see what they do.

                          PALMER
                Right, sir. And----we'll interface with
                the FBI on this, uh, dead body?

                          GARDNER CHUBB
                No! No, we don't want those idiots
                blundering around in this. Burn the
                body. Get rid of it. And keep an eye
                on everyone, see what they do. Report
                back when, um, I don't know. When it
                makes sense.

      A HOPPING MAN IN A UNITARD

      His hands are on his hips. He is darkly Mediterranean and
      very fit. He smiles into the camera as he hops in time to
      upbeat music, kicking a leg out on each beat.

                          MAN
                To the left!... Repeat!... To the
                right!... Repeat!... And in!... And
                out!... And higher!... Repeat!...

      Wider shows that the man is on TV leading the viewer in
      exercise. The viewer, in this case, is Osbourne Cox, on his
      boat.

                                                              84.


      He follows along in his underwear in the cramped quarters
      belowdecks. Boxes and luggage are strewn about, half-
      unpacked.

      He pants as he exercises:

                          OSBOURNE
                I'm bigger... I'm back... I'm
                better... I'm back... than ever... I'm
                back... fuckers... I'm back...

                          MAN ON TV
                ... And good!... Repeat!... Now
                bend!... And bounce!... . And

117   INT. TED'S OFFICE/LINDA'S OFFICE - DAY                          117

      LINDA

      We are on a long lens point-of-view, from several cubicles
      over, of Linda slumped at her desk, head in her arms. We
      faintly hear her sobbing.

      Reverse shows Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies,
      looking at her, unsettled.

      CLOSE ON LINDA

      We are in her cubicle now, her weeping bumping up at the cut.

      A tap against the cubicle window brings her head up.

      Ted Treffon opens the door.

                           TED
                Linda.   You okay?

                          LINDA
                I'm fine, Ted, I'm sorry.

      He sits at the chair alongside her desk.

                          TED
                You don't look fine.

                          LINDA
                No no, I'm... I'm...

                          TED
                You won't tell me what it's about.
                You never let me in, Linda.

                                                       85.


                       LINDA
             Oh, I know you're trustworthy, I
             just... don't want to endanger other
             people with----I mean, it's a path I've
             chosen, it's not, you have to isolate,
             you know, a firewall.

Ted sighs.

                        TED
             Uh-huh. Well, I don't know what to
             think. You both go AWOL on Friday;
             today Chad doesn't bother to come in
             at all----

                       LINDA
             I know, Ted.

                       TED
             Linda, I can't run a gym this way.

                       LINDA
             I know, Ted.

                       TED
             I'm going to have to fire him.

                       LINDA
             No! No no no, Ted!   Just, just. .   .

                         TED
             What?

                       LINDA
             Give me twenty-four hours!

                         TED
             To what?

                       LINDA
             To, um... I don't know, twenty-four
             hours!

                         TED
             Linda----

                       LINDA
             Just give me twenty-four hours to
             solve this thing!

                       TED
             Linda. I have to tell you. A man was
             here earlier asking about you.

                                    Yellow Revision 8/24/07 86.


Linda looks at Ted for a beat, thinking.

                       LINDA
          Foreigner?

                     TED
          Linda, are you in some kind of
          trouble? Is Chad running from
          something?

                    LINDA
          Ted, we know what we're doing. Let me
          ask you this: did he know my name.

                      TED
          Whuh----yes, he was asking about you.
          Employment history, et cetera. Real
          jerk. I told him to get lost.

She takes his hand.

                    LINDA
          Thank you, Ted.

Ted swallows.   He looks down.

                    TED
          Well, we...

Linda still has his hand.      He tries to cover his reaction to
the physical contact.

                    TED (CONT'D)
          ... we just don't give that out at
          Hardbodies.

The phone beeps.    A voice comes through the intercom:

                    VOICE
          Linda, there's a Mr. Krapotkin on line                   *
          two.

                       LINDA
          Omygod!

She punches a button on the phone.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... Hello? Mr. Krapkin?                                  *

                       LINDA
          Yes?

                    VOICE
          This is Ilan Krapotkin. Russian
          embassy. Returning your call.

                     LINDA
          Yes, yes!----hang on.    Ted, I'm sorry.
          This is private.

Looking at her, Ted sighs. He shakes his head sadly, rises
and goes. Linda pushes the door of the cubicle shut with her
foot.

                       LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... Hello.     Is this a secure line, Mr.
          Krapkin?                                               *

Beat.

                       KRAPOTKIN
          Heh-heh.

Another beat.

                    LINDA
          Mr. Krapkin?                                           *

          Yes?

          Is this a secure, uh----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          You are joking?

                     LINDA
          No! I----I'm terribly worried about my
          associate. My----my----you know... Chad.

                     KRAPOTKIN
          Yes?   Why is that?

                    LINDA
          Do you have him?

                    KRAPOTKIN
          Do we have him?

                      LINDA
          Is he----I don't know what the term is,
          did he, "go over"?

                              KRAPOTKIN
                Um...

      Linda glances up. Outside her cubicle window Ted waits; at
      Linda's look he turns palms up: What's going on? Linda holds
      up a finger: one second.

                          LINDA
                Do you know where he is?

                          KRAPOTKIN
                Is he not... at Hardbodies?

                            LINDA
                No, I----look, can I come in and discuss
                this?


118   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                               118 *

      Harry Pfarrer stands at the kitchen counter chopping carrots.
      He is intensely focused and chops very, very quickly,
      producing slices in high volume.

      Reverse shows Katie Cox in a chair in the living room, frozen
      in a look up, a file of papers forgotten in one hand as she
      gazes over half-glasses at Harry. His chopping continues
      unabated.

      After a long look and much chopping:

                          KATIE
                You seem distracted.

                          HARRY
                    (still chopping)
                Do I?

                          KATIE
                Very distracted.      The last two days.

                              HARRY
                Nn.   Work.

      The chopping continues.

      Katie's eyes shift down to the countertop, back up to Harry.
      Another beat.

                          KATIE
                ... That's enough carrots, don't you
                think?

                                                          89.


                      HARRY
          Huh?

                    KATIE
          For the salad?

The chopping stops.

Harry slaps the knife down.   He stares at Katie, jaw
grinding, for a beat.

                    HARRY
          You know: you're really a very
          negative person.

                      KATIE
          ... What?

Through grit teeth:

                    HARRY
          I've tried. To ignore it.    And stay
          upbeat.

Katie, unused to backtalk from Harry, is stunned.   She
returns in a manner as hard as his:

                    KATIE
          Harry: stop the foolishness.

                    HARRY
          Stop the foolishness?

                    KATIE
          Yes. And behave.    You are not talking
          to one of your...

Her fingers form quotes:

                    KATIE (CONT'D)
          ... "shithole buddies."

Harry glares at her, vibrating with rage.   Her look at him is
equally hard.

Harry abruptly turns and stomps up the stairs.

Brief tromping on the second floor.   Katie sits in puzzled
suspense.

Footfalls descend the staircase.

                                             Blue Revision 8/1/07 90.


      Harry reappears at the foot of the stairs with his wedge-
      cushion tucked under an arm. He flings the front door open,
      goes out, slams it shut.


119   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE/INT. HARRY'S CAR - DAY                         119 *

      Harry stomps to his car in the driveway and flings in the
      cushion. He gets in, seething. After a beat he pulls out
      his cell phone and dials.

      A ring.   Pick-up.   A female voice:

                             SANDY
                 Hello?

                             HARRY
                 Honey.    It's so good to hear your
                 voice.

                           SANDY
                 Something wrong, Harry?

                           HARRY
                 No. Yes. Can you come home?       Your
                 baby needs you.

      A beat.

                           HARRY (CONT'D)
                 ... Can you please come home?

                           SANDY
                 Harry, you know I----

                           HARRY
                 I can show you your present.     It's
                 finished.

                             SANDY
                 Oh Harry.    I can't just leave the book
                 tour.

      Harry sags.

                             HARRY
                 Yeah.

                           SANDY
                 There are two days left.     There's
                 still Seattle.

                             HARRY
                 Yeah.

                                           Blue Revision 8/1/07 91.


                          SANDY
                I love you, Harry.

                           HARRY
                Okay.   Yeah. Love you too.

      He folds the phone, miserable.

      As he pockets it his attention is caught by something in the
      side-view mirror:

      The car parked across the street.    A man's shape in the
      driver's seat.


120   EXT. TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                            120 *

      Harry, jaw set, gets out of the car and starts down the
      drive.

      The parked car starts.

                            HARRY
                Hey!    Fucker!

      The car tries to pull out but is closely hemmed in by cars
      front and back; it will need a couple moves.

      Harry runs back to his own car, starts it, throws it into
      reverse and backs straight down the drive toward the
      frantically shuttling car.

      He t-bones it.

                             VOICE FROM WITHIN CAR
                Fucker!

      Harry, amped, throws his car into drive, pulls halfway up the
      driveway.

                           HARRY
                Fucker!   Fucker!

      He again throws the car into reverse.

      The man in the other car abandons his attempt to pull out and
      scrambles frantically toward the passenger side.

      Harry again smashes into the car.

                                           Blue Revision 8/1/07 92.


121   EXT. STREET ACROSS FROM TOWNHOUSE - DAY                         121 *

      The other man emerges from the far side. He flees down the
      sidewalk as fast as his weight will permit, pocket change
      jingling, yelling as he runs:

                            MAN
                Fucker!

      Harry runs after him, calling:

                          HARRY
                Who do you work for?!   Who do you work
                for?!

      Pounding footsteps.

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... Tell me!

      The overweight man does not have Harry's stamina: Harry
      closes, leaps, and tackles.

      He crawls up the man's body, hand-over-hand, panting:

                          HARRY (CONT'D)
                ... Who do you work for? CIA?     NSC?

      The other man is panting much harder:

                          MAN
                Tuchman Marsh!

      This stops Harry.   He isn't sure what he's heard.

                            HARRY
                What?

                          MAN
                Tuchman Marsh!

                          HARRY
                ... Tuchman Marsh?

                            MAN
                Yes!

                          HARRY
                Your name is... Tuchman Marsh?

                          MAN
                Tuchman Marsh Hauptman Rodino!

                                                              93.


Harry stares at the man underneath him.     The gasping man
explains:

                    MAN (CONT'D)
          ... I work for them!

                    HARRY
          You... work for Tuchman Marsh.

                       MAN
          Yes!

                    HARRY
          Which is a law firm.

                   MAN
          No! A rock band!      Yes, it's a law
          firm!

                    HARRY
          Well... why are you following me?

                    MAN
          Divorce action, numbnuts!

Harry is blindsided.    He stares.   He slowly sits up,
digesting:

                    HARRY
          My... my wife hired you?!

The freed Tuchman Marsh man also sits up, still panting
heavily.

                    MAN
          No. Your wife hired Tuchman Marsh.
          Tuchman Marsh hired me. I work for
          Tuchman Marsh.

                      HARRY
          You're----you're----a divorce detective.

                       MAN
          Not just.     Credit, missing persons,
          whatever.

                    HARRY
          But this is divorce.

                    MAN
              ("duh")
          Well... yeah.

                                                            94.


Harry rises and walks stiffly, zombie-like, up the street.
The man watches him go.

After a few paces Harry stops and sits on the curb.    He
starts weeping.

The man, still breathing heavily, calls out:

                     MAN (CONT'D)
          ... Jesus----grow up, man!    It happens
          to everybody!

Harry's cell phone chirps.     He fishes it out and unfolds it,
sniveling.

                       HARRY
          Yeah?

                    VOICE
          Harry, it's Osbourne Cox.

Harry stares, trying to fit this in.     Osbourne prompts, after
a silent beat:

                       VOICE (CONT'D)
          ... Harry?

                       HARRY
          Yeah?

                    OSBOURNE
          Harry, could I get your wife's number?
          This is Osbourne Cox, could I trouble
          you for your wife's----

                    HARRY
          You can't tell her anything she
          doesn't already know, fucker.

                       OSBOURNE
          What?

Harry again stares: maybe he has this figured wrong.

After a silence:

                    OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
          ...Is this... Harry Pfarrer?

                    HARRY
          You want... Sandy's number?

Echoing up the street:

                                           Blue Revision 8/1/07 95.


                          MAN
                Can I use your phone?   To call a tow?


122   INT. OSBOURNE'S BOAT - DAY                                      122 *

      Osbourne paces the cramped cabin belowdecks, a phone to his
      ear. He is unshaven, wearing a robe.

      Filtered rings, then a connection:

                          SANDY'S VOICE
                Hello?

                          OSBOURNE
                Sandy?

                          SANDY
                Yes?

                          OSBOURNE
                Hi, it's Osbourne Cox, how are you.
                Hi.

                          SANDY
                ... Hi.

                            OSBOURNE
                Hi. Sorry to call out of the blue but
                I have a, well, a publishing question
                and I thought you might be the person
                to ask, I have this manuscript,
                something to do with my professional
                experiences, not to go into too much
                detail but I think it's pretty
                explosive stuff and I think that it
                could merit a fairly wide readership
                handled properly and it isn't quite
                finished yet but there's a situation
                where I'm worried about it leaking now
                and maybe excerpts being published or
                on the internet, whatever, without my
                permission, and a lot of the impact
                being, um, blunted, so I'm actually
                anxious to bring it to market sooner
                than I'd planned----I mean, like now, in
                fact----so I was thinking, I know you,
                and you seem to do well, so I was
                wondering if you were happy with your
                publisher. The people you use.

      A long beat.

                                                                 96.


                          SANDY
                You've written a children's book?

                            OSBOURNE
                No! No no, a, a kind of a memoir, but
                ----doesn't your company have an adult
                arm? Or isn't it, uh, the children's
                arm? Of a regular publisher?

                          SANDY
                Pappas & Swain do children's
                literature.

                          OSBOURNE
                Uh-huh. I see. So they don't----
                okay... Are you well?

                          SANDY
                Very well thank you.    And you.

                         OSBOURNE
                Yes. Good. Okay, well, thank you
                Sandy.

                            SANDY
                Yes.    Good talking to you.

      Disconnect.

      Osbourne yanks the rubber band off a bundle of mail.

                            OSBOURNE
                Bitch.


123   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - HALLWAY - DAY                             123

      Two pairs of footsteps echo down a long hallway as Linda
      Litzke is escorted by a solemn Russian staffer.


124   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - ANOTHER ROOM - DAY                        124

      A waiting room.    A long beat; Linda sits waiting.

      A door opens.    Mr. Krapotkin emerges.

      Linda stands to go to the inner office but Krapotkin motions
      her back down.

                          KRAPOTKIN
                Yes, madam. Can we help you?

                                                        97.


                    LINDA
          What kind of Mickey Mouse embassy are
          you running?! I've been waiting here
          for fifty-five minutes, and I'm----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          I am so sorry, madam.   An urgent
          matter.

                    LINDA
          Well this could be urgent too, since,
          you know, Chad has been missing for
          forty-eight hours now and----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          I don't know the whereabouts of Chad,
          madam.

                    LINDA
          Well he was gathering information for
          you when he----

                    KRAPOTKIN
          We're not interested in such
          "information". It was drivel.

Linda is dumbfounded.

A silent beat.

                    LINDA
          ... Dribble!

Krapotkin fishes something from his pocket.

                    KRAPOTKIN
          Would you like your disk back?

                    LINDA
          ... Dribble!

Krapotkin stands with the disk extended toward her.

                    KRAPOTKIN
          I'm so sorry I can't help you.

Linda recovers from her astonishment and is moved to outrage:

                    LINDA
          I'll tell you what's dribble! You
          listen to me, Mr. Krapkin! I am----

125   INT. RUSSIAN EMBASSY - HALLWAY AGAIN                          125

      Looking the opposite way.

      We hear two pairs of footsteps. They approach for several
      beats and then Linda and her escort enter frame and recede,
      footsteps echoing. The staffer's hand is on Linda's elbow.

      As we hold on their backs and they continue to walk, Linda
      jerks her arm away; the staffer regrabs it. She jerks away
      again.

                          LINDA
                Cut it out.

      An exercise show plays on the TV, unwatched. Osbourne sits
      at a little table looking at a notice torn from a windowed
      envelope.

                            OSBOURNE
                ... What?

      He brings the notice close, squints at it.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... What the fuck?

      He quickly shuffles through the rest of the mail, pulls out
      another envelope, rips it open.

       A MINUTE LATER

       Osbourne paces, drink in hand, staring at another piece of
       mail.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 What the fuck?

       A MINUTE LATER

       Osbourne is back at the table, drink half-consumed, listening
       at the phone.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... Yes... No... Yes, I want to know

                 returned for insufficient funds...
                 Slip fee, for docking my boat, the
                 check was returned... No, m'dam, it's
                 not zero, I have about forty thousand
                 dollars in that account... When? ...
                 When?... But she can't do that----no,
                 yes, technically it may be a joint
                 account but she doesn't use it, it's
                 not her money... No! No! What
                 access, it's not possible! Without my

                                            100.


          TED
Linda, the whole thing is crazy. It
was crazy the first time, and you want
to do it again? Break into the man's
house? And why would----why would----you
said the Russians didn't even want
this stuff!

          LINDA
My world is bigger than that, Ted.
There's other people. There's the
Chinese.

          TED
Linda, these surgeries----

          LINDA
It's not just the surgeries, Ted!
It's not just the money! We can use
it as leverage! To get Chad back!

          TED
What do you mean "get him back"!

          LINDA
Information is power, Ted!     Hel-lo!

          TED
What do you mean "get him back"!      You
don't know where he is!

          LINDA
Somebody has him.    And we can----

          TED
You ask the police to help you find
missing people! And you----

          LINDA
I can't take it! I can't take it! I
can't take it! You know I can't do
that! We're operating off the map
here, Ted! This is way higher than
the police, it's higher than that!

               TED
Linda, I----

          LINDA
I need a can-do person, Ted! I hate
your negativity! I hate all your
reasons why not! I hate you! I hate
you!

                                           Blue Revision 8/1/07 101.


      Weeping, she storms out.

      Ted stares, shell-shocked.


130   INT. BAR - DAY                                                      130 *

      In close shot, Ted sits onto a bar stool.

      Dim bar, tinkling piano.

                          BARTENDER'S VOICE
                What'll it be.

      Ted stares straight ahead.     A long beat.

      He finally focuses on the bartender, off.      He swallows.

      Another beat.

                          TED

131   INT. LINDA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                      131

      Night. Linda is asleep in her bedroom.        The buzz of the in-
      house intercom.

      Linda stirs, wakes and reaches for the bedside phone.

                             LINDA
                Hurrow----

      She removes an appliance from her mouth.

                             LINDA (CONT'D)
                ... Hello?

                          FILTERED VOICE
                It's Harry.


132   INT. LINDA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                    132

      Minutes later.   Harry is gazing off, slack-jawed, haunted.

      After a beat:

                          HARRY
                You think a marriage is... and then
                you...

      The thought drifts off.    A sad shake of the head.

                                                           102.


Linda enters, handing him a drink.    She sits opposite.

                    LINDA
          But this was a long time coming.

Harry looks up, surprised.

                      HARRY
          Was it?

He catches himself.   His gaze wanders back to the haunted,
empty spot.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Well, yeah... right...

                    LINDA
          You're depressed, Harry.

                    HARRY
              (hollowly)
          I am depressed. I gotta exercise. I
          haven't run in three days... butt-
          crunches... anything... Do you think I
          could stay here for a little while?

Linda starts quietly weeping.

This focuses Harry's attention.    He looks at her as if just
now noticing her.

                      HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... What?    What's wrong, baby?

                    LINDA
          It can't always come from me, Harry!
          I'm not that strong!

Harry moves next to her and puts an arm around her.

                    HARRY
          What's wrong, baby?     Harry's here.

                    LINDA
          You're not here for me! I need a can-
          do person! You're all... defeated!

                    HARRY
          I'm sorry, baby----

                    LINDA
          Chad is the only can-do person I know
          and he's gone, Harry, he's gone.

                                                       103.


                    HARRY
          I'll be good. I'll be better.     I just
          need to exercise. Are there
          pedestrian paths around here?

He squeezes her shoulder, takes a gulp of the drink.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Who the fuck is Chad?

                    LINDA
          Could you help me find him?  He's a
          friend from work. You know law
          enforcement people, right? You could
          call, unofficially?

                    HARRY
          Wait a minute, what's his name?   What
          happened?

                    LINDA
          Chad Feldheimer. He just disappeared.
          He hasn't been at work or at home for
          two days.

                         HARRY
          Okay.

                         LINDA
          He----

                    HARRY
          You know his social security number?

                         LINDA
          Huh?     NO!    I----

                    HARRY
          It's okay. That's okay.     What's the
          last place you saw him?

                    LINDA
              (snuffling)
          I don't know! He just disappeared!
          The last place I saw him was the Jamba
          Juice on K Street. And he's gone.

Harry squeezes her shoulder again.

                    HARRY
          Okay baby. We'll find your friend.
          Missing person. Piece of cake.

                                                                 104.


133   INT. PEDIATRIC EXAM ROOM - DAY                                      133

      AN EPIGLOTTIS

      Illuminated by a small light. It quavers.       The tongue starts
      to rise and the mouth starts to close.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE
                No, stay open...

      Wider: a pediatric examining room decorated with colorful
      prints of cartoon characters and clowns.

      Katie Cox, in a white smock, has a tongue depressor in a five-
      year-old's mouth and a light-sight in one hand. She
      withdraws both as the child finishes closing his mouth. The
      child's mother stands by.

      Katie grasps the child by the upper arm.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... You have to let the doctor look in
                your mouth.

      The child keeps his lips pressed together.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... Now you listen to me, young man.
                You do as I say or I'll ask your
                mother to leave the doctor's office
                and the two of us will sort out what's
                what.

      The child looks at her fearfully.

      The wall phone bleeps.

      Katie rolls to it on her castored chair.

                             WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... Yes.

      She listens briefly.

                          WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                ... With a patient.

      She hangs up.


134   INT. OSBOURNE'S BOAT - DAY                                          134

      Osbourne, in dressing gown and pyjamas, is barking into the
      phone:

                                                               105.


                          OSBOURNE
                Yeah? The same patient she's been
                with since YESTERDAY? BullSHIT!

                             FILTERED VOICE
                Dr. Cox has suggested you call her
                attorney----

                          OSBOURNE
                Yeah, RIGHT! Tell her I got the new
                fucking keys!

      He slams down the phone.


135   EXT. BOAT DECK                                                  135

      The hatch is thrown open and Osbourne emerges from below.
      There is a large built-in toolbox just by the hatch. He
      yanks it open and pulls out a hatchet.

                          OSBOURNE
                New keys...


136   DOCK                                                            136

      Osbourne strides grimly down the dock in his bathrobe,
      hatchet in hand.


137   INT. "GOOD MORNING, SEATTLE" SET - DAY                          137

      Sandy Pfarrer is sitting in an armchair on a morning show
      living room set surrounded by a dozen eight-year-olds sitting
      on the carpet. Hosts Del and Connie sit next to her in
      swivel chairs.

                            SANDY
                    (reading)
                And it was just then----at that very
                moment----that Oliver sneezed----

                             DEL
                Can    we just----I'm sorry to interrupt
                but    we have to let the folks at home
                see    this illustration! Can we just
                get    a shot of that...

      He is holding the book open, face out on his lap.

                            DEL (CONT'D)
                There----there it is. Oliver.
                Interrupting the filibuster with----

                                                       106.


                    CONNIE
          That's wonderful!

                    DEL
          Wonderful! The book is "Point of
          Order, Oliver!" and the talented
          author is Sandra Pfarrer. We're gonna
          go to a station break and then be
          right back with Bud Fraighling, the
          Sultan of Salad, and Part Two of our
          special interview with Dermot
          Mulroney. So keep it where it is!

Del and Connie and Sandy all wear smiles that stay fixed a
beat too long. Then Del relaxes and turns to Sandy.

                    DEL (CONT'D)
          ...Great segment.

                       SANDY
          Thank you.

                    DEL
          Yeah, you know we thought it might be
          fun if you joined us with Bud
          Fraighling and help make the Fiesta
          Salad, when we move over.

                    CONNIE
          Over on the kitchen set.

                    SANDY
          That wasn't discussed.

                      DEL
          Oh, sure! No! Only if you want to!
          Your segment went great, we just
          thought----

                    SANDY
          I'm sorry, I made plans.

                    DEL
          Okay, great!

                    CONNIE
          Great to see you again, Sandra!

She gives them a cold smile as a technician finishes
unclipping her lavaliere and she leaves.

Connie looks at Del and mouths "Bitch."

                                                               107.


138   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                        138

      Osbourne's crumple-backed car roars up. It cuts a corner of
      the lawn and squeals to a halt in the drive. Osbourne
      emerges, still in robe and pyjamas, with the hatchet.

      He goes to the front door and bashes at the knob with the
      blunt end of the hatchet.

                          OSBOURNE
                New... fucking... keys... How's this
                for access...

      Hardware starts to fall off and jangle onto the stoop.
      Osbourne tries the sharp end of the hatchet a couple times,
      decides he prefers the blunt end.

                          OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... How's this for motherfucking
                access...

      More things fall off.    The knob wobbles in the door.

      Osbourne pushes the door open.


139   INT. STUDIO - HALLWAY - DAY                                     139

      Sandy Pfarrer is accompanied by a bright young PR woman.

                          PR WOMAN
                That was way out of line. We were so
                unbelievably clear with them: just an
                Oliver segment.

                             SANDY
                It's fine.

                          PR WOMAN
                Del and Connie are such putzes.

                             SANDY
                It's fine.     Thank you.   We're
                finished.

                           PR WOMAN
                Huh?   Well, okay. Great, uh----

      Sandy, entered her dressing room, is already shutting the
      door on her.

                                                              108.


140   INT. STUDIO DRESSING ROOM - DAY                                140

      Inside a man lounges reading a magazine.   He looks a little
      like Harry but younger.

                          SANDY
                Thought that would never be over.

      The man rises and kisses her.

                            MAN
                Mmm.    Me too.

                          SANDY
                Let me scrub this crap off my face.


141   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE KITCHEN - DAY                               141

      Osbourne opens a cabinet, muttering:

                          OSBOURNE
                Just for starters...

      He takes out liquor bottles and starts putting them in a
      packing case on the kitchen counter.


142   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL - DAY                                     142

      People sit on benches eating lunches. Harry Pfarrer is on
      the bench where he and Linda met, once again spitting
      sunflower seeds.

      Linda walks up.    They greet each other with a kiss.

                          HARRY
                Hello there sunshine.    You look great.

                          LINDA
                Well you seem better.

      Harry does indeed seem more like his old self.

                          HARRY
                Yeah, I snuck in a little gym time
                this morning. And our exercise last
                night didn't hurt!

      Linda is shocked but secretly pleased:

                            LINDA
                Harry!

                                                          109.


                    HARRY
          Boy, I am through banging my head
          against the wall. I am gonna start
          doing what's right for me.

                    LINDA
          That's how I believe, also.   You have
          to do what's right for----

                    HARRY
          Yeah! Hell yeah! I mean I had a
          shock recently, and I realized you
          know, life is not infinite. No one's
          immortal.

                    LINDA
          No one's immortal.

                    HARRY
          You have to get from each day its
          full, uh, squeeze the juice from every
          day because there but for the grace of
          God----

                    LINDA
          Exactly. The important thing is to
          maintain a positive outlook. Always
          up. Always ebullient.

                    HARRY
          That's right, don't sweat the small
          stuff...

Linda chimes in:

Linda and Harry

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... and it's all small stuff.

Harry reaches for Linda and she slides closer.     He puts an
arm around her.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          This is where we first met.   Remember?

                    LINDA
          Of course I do.

                    HARRY
          You never know what the important days
          are, until... until, um...

                                                          110.


The thought drifts away as his gaze fixes on something.    With
his look still fixed:

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... I told myself I was gonna stop
          being paranoid, but... is that guy
          looking at us?

Linda follows his look.

On a bench a short distance away a middle-aged man with
aviator glasses and hair plugs is staring at them.

                    LINDA
              (hastily)
          No, no.

A slightly overweight woman stops tentatively in front of
the man in the aviator glasses and they start to talk.

Linda turns to Harry.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... Have you found out anything about
          Chad?

                    HARRY
          Nothing yet, I've made a couple calls.
          I don't think it'll take long.

                    LINDA
          Really?

                    HARRY
          Oh yeah, there are so many data bases
          now it's a joke...

Relaxing now that he sees the man in aviator glasses engaged
in conversation, Harry warms to his theme.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... Back when I was in PP there was
          still some art to finding people. Not
          any more. And now with the cell
          phones? Pretty soon they're gonna
          know where everyone is. Everyone. At
          any given moment. I mean it's almost
          the reality now. You would be amazed.

                    LINDA
          Uh-huh.

                                                         111.


                      HARRY
          Did he----when you left the Jamba Juice
          ----did Chad say anything about where he
          might be going?

                    LINDA
          Oh, I know where he was going.

                      HARRY
          Oh yeah?

                    LINDA
          A residence in Alexandria.    On
          Hillsboro Drive.

Harry has stopped chewing.    He is staring at her.

Linda feels obliged to fill the silence.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... 2055 Hillsboro.

Harry stares.    Linda doesn't know what to make of his fixed
stare.

                    LINDA (CONT'D)
          ... It's, um. The residence of a guy
          named Osbourne Cox.

Harry is beginning to look sick.

A long silence.

Then, quietly:

                    HARRY
          Who are you?

Now Linda stares, unsure of what to make of the question.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... WHO ARE YOU?

Linda's eyes widen.   She is a little frightened.

People nearby turn to look.   It is a scene.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

Harry reaches up.    He grabs her by the shoulders and shakes.

                    HARRY (CONT'D)
          ... WHO ARE YOU? REALLY?

                                                                  112.


      Linda is at sea.    She answers in a small voice:

                            LINDA
                  I'm ... just ... Linda Litzke.

      Harry stares at her.

      A long beat.

      He leaps to his feet and looks around in a panic.

      His point-of-view, sweeping the park. Nearby, the man with
      plugs, though talking with his date, is looking at him again.
      Farther away, a man sits in a curbside sedan. Watching?
      Hard to say.

      Harry turns and runs.       Linda gapes.

                                LINDA (CONT'D)
                  ... Harry!


143   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                            143

      Osbourne sets the packing box heavily      down on a bureau in the
      upstairs bedroom. The box is a third       loaded up with liquor
      bottles. It also holds a mixed drink       which Osbourne now
      takes out. The ice cubes clink as he       sips, poking through
      things in the bureau.

      One drawer holds scarves and accessories and a large case.
      He opens the case and starts dumping jewelry from it into the
      cardboard box.

      Suddenly:

                                OSBOURNE
                  Ow!   Fuck!

      He yanks his hand back and shakes it.      He looks at the ball
      of his thumb. He sucks it.

      He carefully picks a brooch out of the jewelry case and
      flings it across the room.

      He resumes dumping jewelry into his box.

      He suddenly stops:

      A faint knock.    The front door.

      Osbourne waits.

      The knock repeats.

                                                                113.


      Another beat.

      The front door creaks open.

      Osbourne carefully sets down his drink. He steps quietly to
      the closet and pulls a small cedar chest off a high shelf.


144   EXT. WASHINGTON MALL/INT. LINDA'S CAR - DAY                      144

      Linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street
      bordering the mall. She gets in and turns the ignition.

      Pulling into traffic she checks her rear-view, and her look
      snags on:

      A dark four-door sedan pulling out a few cars back. It falls
      in behind her. Its driver is a man in sunglasses. He
      reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear.

      Linda frowns.   She looks forward, glances again at the
      mirror.

      Another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first.    Its
      driver is also a man in sunglasses.


145   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           145

      Downstairs, Osbourne rounds the corner from entryway to
      living room, a handgun at the ready. His drink is in his
      other hand. Ice cubes clink as he moves.

      The living room is empty.

      Osbourne advances cautiously.     A quick sidelong look at the
      kitchen.

      Empty.

      He proceeds to the basement door.


146   INT. LINDA'S CAR/EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY                         146

      LINDA DRIVING

      She gives worried glances at her rear-view.

      The light ahead turns yellow, red.

      Cars ahead stop.   Linda stops.

      A rhythmic thudding sound.    It almost makes her car vibrate.

                                                               114.


      She looks around.   She rolls down her window, sticks her head
      out, looks up.

      A black helicopter hovers overhead, rotors thudding. A black-
      clad body leans partway out. The person seems to be looking
      down.

      Linda draws her head back in.

                           LINDA
                 Oh for Pete's sake.


147   INT. COX TOWNHOUSE - BASEMENT                                    147

      Osbourne is slowly descending the stairs, gun and drink in
      either hand, gun up, ice cubes clinking.

      The basement comes slowly into view.

      Someone stands behind his desk, at the computer.

      Osbourne descends further. He stops on the bottom step and
      stares at Ted Treffon, the soulful manager of Hardbodies.
      Ted stares at him.

      A long silence between the two men.

      Then, quietly:

                           OSBOURNE
                 And you are... my wife's lover.

                            TED
                 No.

                           OSBOURNE
                 Then what are you doing here.

      Silence.

      Osbourne takes the last step down.    He advances slowly, gun
      trained on Ted.

      Osbourne's look, holding on Ted, changes.

                           OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                 ... I know you. You're the guy at the
                 gym.

      Ted licks his lips.

                           TED
                 I'm not here representing Hardbodies.

                                                       115.


                     OSBOURNE
           I know what you represent. You
           represent the idiocy of today.

Ted shakes his head.

                     TED
           I don't represent that, either.

                     OSBOURNE
           Oh yes. You're the guy when I went to
           ask about that moronic woman.

                      TED
           She's not----

                     OSBOURNE
           You're in league with that moronic
           woman. You're part of a league of
           morons.

                        TED
           No.

                     OSBOURNE
           Yes. You're one of the morons I've
           been fighting all my life. My whole
           fucking life. But guess what. Guess
           what. Today I win.

BANG.

                        TED
           Ah!

Ted is shot in the upper chest.

He grabs a three-hole punch from the desktop and flings it at
Osbourne and charges.

                        OSBOURNE
           Oh!

BANG----another shot goes off.

Ted barrels into Osbourne, knocking him over----

                        OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
           ... Oooph!

----and goes on past him, lumbering up the stairs.

Osbourne gets to his feet.

                                            Pink Revision 8/14/07 116.


                             OSBOURNE (CONT'D)
                ... Stop!     Intruder!


148   EXT. COX TOWNHOUSE - DAY                                           148

      Ted staggers out of the house, a hand pressed to his chest.
      He has reached the front lawn when Osbourne emerges, robe
      flapping, pursuing with the hatchet.

                             OSBOURNE
                Intruder!

      He quickly catches up to Ted and whacks at him.

                             TED
                Oh!

      Osbourne whacks him down.       He keeps whacking at him.


149   INT. CHUBB'S OFFICE - DAY                                          149

      Gardner Chubb is behind his desk.

                             GARDNER CHUBB
                Wait.

      Palmer DeBakey Smith is seated across from him.      He freezes.

      A beat.

      Gardner Chubb rubs his forehead.

                          GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
                ... Wait a minute. Where's the
                treasury guy? Pfarrer?

                             PALMER
                Right now?

                             GARDNER CHUBB
                Right now.

                          PALMER
                In a detention room at Washington
                Dulles.                                                        *

                             GARDNER CHUBB
                ... Why?

                           PALMER
                He was trying to board a flight to
                Venezuela.
                           (MORE)

                                                   117.

                    PALMER (CONT'D)
          We had his name on a hot list, the INS
          pulled him. Don't know why he was
          going to Venezuela.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          You don't know.

                        PALMER
          No sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          We have no extradition with Venezuela.

                    PALMER
          Oh. Uh-huh. Well----what should we do
          with him?

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          For fuck's sake, put him on the next
          flight to Venezuela!

                       PALMER
          Yes sir.     Okay.

Gardner Chubb is weary.

                        GARDNER CHUBB
          Okay.      So the gym manager is dead.

                        PALMER
          Yes sir.

                    GARDENER CHUBB
          The body is----

                        PALMER
          Gone, sir.

                        GARDENER CHUBB
          Okay----

                      PALMER
          But----there was a, uh... snag...

                        GARDNER CHUBB
          What.

                    PALMER
          Well. This analyst, Cox, was
          attacking the gym guy. It was broad
          daylight, on the street. Our man
          there didn't know what to do. He felt
          he had to step in.

                                                   118.


                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Yes?

                    PALMER
          He, uh... He shot the analyst.      He
          shot Cox.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Good!    Great! Is he dead?

                      PALMER
          No sir.

Gardner Chubb grimaces.

                    PALMER (CONT'D)
          ... He's in coma. They're not sure
          whether he'll make it. They think,
          they're pretty sure he has no brain
          function.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Okay. Okay. If he wakes up we'll
          worry about it then. Jesus, what a
          clusterfuck. That's it then. No one
          else really knows anything. Okay.

                      PALMER
          Um.     Well sir, there is...

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          What.

                      PALMER
          Um...

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          What.

                    PALMER
          There is the woman.   The gym woman.
          Linda Litzke.

                     GARDNER CHUBB
          Oh yeah.   Fuck. Where is she.

                    PALMER
          We picked her up.    We have her.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Can we, uh----

                                                   119.


                      PALMER
          She, she, she says she'll play ball if
          we pay for some... I know this sounds
          odd----some surgeries she wants.
          Cosmetic surgery. She says she'll sit
          on everything.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          How much.

                    PALMER
          There were several procedures.    All
          together they run to, um----

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Pay it.

                    PALMER
          Yes sir. Should I pay it out of,
          should it be from----

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          One of the black accounts, I don't
          give a shit. The January fund.
          Whatever.

                      PALMER
          Okay.

                      GARDNER CHUBB
          Jesus.    Jesus fucking Christ.

He shakes his head.

                    GARDNER CHUBB (CONT'D)
          ... What did we learn, Palmer.

                    PALMER
          I don't know, sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          I don't fucking know either. I guess
          we learned not to do it again.

                      PALMER
          Yes sir.

                    GARDNER CHUBB
          Although I'm fucked if I know what we
          did.

                      PALMER
          Yes sir.    Hard to say.

                                                           120.


      We pull back from Gardner Chubb, shaking his head.

                           GARDNER CHUBB
                Jesus.   Jesus fucking Christ.


150   EXT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - AERIAL - DAY                        150

      We pull up, back through the clouds, away.
The Cable Guy

Lou Holtz Jr.

Shooting Script October 31, 1995 (White)

Revised Pages November 14, 1995 (Pink)

1	FULL FRAME - WHITE NOISE

Credits begin. The entire frame is filled with white noise within which one can make out thefaint 
image of a television program. Every few moments the channel changes, revealing a new ghostly 
image.

The camera pulls back very slowly. We reveal that this image is coming from a twenty seven inch 
television.

The camera pulls back some more and we see a man's hand enter frame holding a remote
control. The hand changes channels frantically.

The camera pulls back into its final position and we see STEVEN BARTOWSKY, thirty
years old, sitting on his couch. He is trying to find a channel with viewable reception.
Unfortunately for him  his cable is not hooked up.

STEVE
(looks at watch)
Jesus, where's the cable guy already?

END OF CREDIT SEQUENCE

1A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It is a stylish old apartment. There are half unpacked boxes strewn about the floor. Steven has just 
moved in. The phone rings.

STEVEN
(into the phone)
Hello.

2	NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS

We see Steven's best friend RICK standing in the middle of a busy newsroom. He is a rough 
looking, cynical local news cameraman. In the background, hanging from the ceiling is a television 
set.

ON THE TV - An anchorman sits at his desk fixing his hair as he waits to go on the air. A graphic 
on the screen says "Sam Sweet Trial Update."

RICK
How's the move going?

3	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Steven unpacks as they speak. The phone call intercuts between the two locations.

STEVEN
Horrible. The cable guy is missing in
action. Apparently he's going to be here
sometime between eight AM and my death.

RICK
You haven't called Robin have you?
Please tell me you didn't call her.

STEVEN
(sarcastically)
No, I'm giving her space.
(beat)
I can't believe she's doing this.

RICK
You never should have asked her to marry
you. You're the mad smotherer.

STEVEN
All she had to do was say no. She didn't
have to kick me out. I feel like Felix
Unger.

RICK
You forced her to evaluate the
relationship. If you didn't propose she
would never have realized how unhappy she
was.

STEVE
I don't want to talk about it.
So what time are you going to come by?

RICK
I can't. I'm working double shifts the
rest of the week.

STEVEN
It's my first night here. Don't do this
to me.

RICK
The other camera guy pulled out his back.
Besides, I spent the last two weeks with
you on my couch. Isn't that enough?

STEVEN
Fine, fine.

RICK
One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy
fifty bucks, he'll give you all the movie
channels for free. Even the dirty ones.

STEVEN
I couldn't. I'm not good at that stuff.
What if he says no? I'll feel like an
idiot.

RICK
None of them say no, believe me. I'll
talk to you later.

Steven hangs up, and waits.

DISSOLVE TO:

4	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Steven continues unpacking. He is very neat. He opens a box and finds a pictures of him with his 
ex-girlfriend. He looks at one sadly, considering whether or not to put it on display. He puts it 
back in the box.

4A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Establishing shot of a renovated apartment building built in the nineteen twenties. A moving truck 
pulls into a gated side garage.

5	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Movers deliver a small breakfast table and chairs. Steven directs them as to where to put them.

CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 3:52 P.M.

6	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Steven puts a few feet of tin foil on his antenna to help the reception. He changes channels. Still 
nothing. He pulls it off frustrated.

7	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Many of the boxes are gone. Steven lies on the couch, staring at the ceiling, fidgeting. He is unable 
to fill his day without cable.

STEVEN
Where the hell is he?

8	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Steven paces back and forth across the room. He stares at his watch frequently.

CLOSE UP OF CLOCK - 5:12 P.M.

9	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - LATER

Steven slowly eats a sandwich in his empty kitchen. He looks at the clock. It says five-thirty. He 
picks up the phone and dials. A machine picks up.

ROBIN (VO)
Hi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If
you are trying to reach Steven he can now
be reached at 555-3837.

Steven hangs up.

10	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SUNSET

Steven does sit ups. He looks at the clock.

CLOSE UP OF THE CLOCK - 6:48 P.M.

STEVEN
(to himself)
Forget it. Idiots.

He gets up, and walks into the bathroom.

11	INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven gets undressed. He turns on the shower, adjusts the heat, then gets in. He tries to lose his 
tension by letting the hot water engulf him. He takes some shampoo, and lathers up his hair.

THE DOORBELL RINGS
STEVEN
(annoyed)
Oh great.

THE DOORBELL RINGS SEVERAL TIMES

Steven jumps out of the shower, soaking wet, throws on a bathrobe and runs to the door.

STEVEN
Don't leave! I'm here! I'm here!

12	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs to the door.

CABLE GUY (OS)
Hello! Cable Guy!

Steven reaches the door, and looks through the peep-hole.

P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

The CABLE GUY is walking away.

INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

Steven opens the door and yells to the Cable Guy.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

STEVEN
Hey, wait!

The Cable Guy turns back.

CABLE GUY
Well, look who decided to show up. I was
just gonna go collect my retirement
pension.

The Cable Guy wears a clean white jump suit, and is extremely confident despite the fact that he 
speaks with a slight lisp. This lisp gives him a child-like quality.

STEVEN
You were supposed to be here four hours
ago.

CABLE GUY
Was I? So I'm the tardy one. Good to
know.

STEVEN
Yes. I had to go to the Bed 'n Bath
place, but now it's closed.
CABLE GUY

(turns to leave)
Maybe I shouldn't have come at all  jerk
off!
(turns back smiling)
I'm just joking. Let's do this.
(looks around)
Oh, the old McNair place. I never thought
they'd get the floors clean after what
happened here.

STEVEN
What happened?

CABLE GUY
(long beat)
They had a lot of cats.

They walk into Steven's living room.

CABLE GUY
Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a
comment card.

He pulls out a card, and hands it to Steven without turning back to look at him.

CABLE GUY
Please mail it in when I am done.

STEVEN
These go to your boss?

CABLE GUY
No, they go to me. I'm a
perfectioniss perfectioniss
(he strains to lose his lisp)
perfectionisst.
Now let's take a look at what we're
dealing with.

The Cable Guy walks around the room with his hands out, sensing the space.

CABLE GUY
Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me
baby. Tell me where you like it. That's
it baby.

He zones in on one wall. He fells the wall in a sensuous manner.

CABLE GUY
Here's your sweet spot.

He pulls out his drill, and begins drilling.

CABLE GUY
So your lady kicked you out.

STEVEN
What?

CABLE GUY
In preparing your service I noticed you
were previously wired across town at 1268
and a half Chestnut. Last week the
billing was transferred to one Robin
Harris. Smells like heartbreak to me.

STEVEN
I really don't want to talk about it with
you. Could you please just install my
cable? I'm going to get dressed.

CABLE GUY
No sweat.

Steven walks away, into the hallway. A moment later the Cable Guy runs to him.

CABLE GUY
Hey, I'm going to go to the hallway so I
can access the floorboards. Don't be
spooked if you hear someone crawling
underneath you.

STEVEN
Okay, whatever.

Steven walks toward his bedroom.

CABLE GUY
Put on your bathing suit 'cause you'll be
channel surfing in no time.

The Cable Guy pulls the trigger on his drill twice to punctuate his joke.

13	INT. - STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

CLOSE UP - THE TELEVISION

RIKKI KLIEMAN from COURT TV broadcasts from their studio.

RIKKI KLIEMAN
(to camera)
So ends day fifty-four of the trial of
former child star Sam Sweet who has been
accused of shooting his twin brother,
Stan, in cold blood. The twins were
stars of the hit sitcom "Double Trouble"
which aired from nineteen seventy-seven
till nineteen eighty-four.

A video package rolls in - We see several photographs of Sam Sweet and his twin brother at 
various ages. Included is the cast photo of "Double Trouble." Pictured in the photo are eight-year-
old Stan and Sam and Conrad Janis as their single dad.

We see a brief clip from "Double Trouble," starring the two eight-year-old boys, then a shot of 
Sam Sweet being taken out of a police car in handcuffs.

RIKKI KLIEMAN
(to camera)
Life wasn't so sweet after the cancellation
of their program. Hollywood chewed them
up and spit them out. A frustrated Sam
turned to petty larceny, while his more
impressionable brother, Stan, fell in
with a fringe cult called "The
Brotherhood of Friends." Reduced to
tabloid fodder a fury was growing inside
of Sam. A burning need to be recognized
as an individual, not a person famous for
having an identical twin. A need that
took the form of four shotgun blasts on
the night of November fourteenth. And so
today his attorneys continue the unusual
defense of "Twin Envy."

ANGLE ON

Steven re-enters the room. The Cable Guy is watching television.

STEVEN
How's it going?

The Cable Guy holds up one finger as if to say "quiet." His eyes never leave the TV.

CABLE GUY
Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I
hope they fry this bastard.

Steven sees that the Cable Guy has completely redecorated the room in a fashion which makes the 
room impractical for anything other than watching television. The TV is now on the stairs 
blocking the entrance into the living room. All furniture faces the TV, making conversation 
impossible.

STEVEN
(looks around)
What happened?

CABLE GUY
(jumps to his feet)
The arrangement of your major appliances
and your furniture was causing some noisy
pics and hum bars in your reception. I
moved a few things. Cleared it right up.
Is that cool?

STEVEN
(non-confrontational)
I guess so.

CABLE GUY
You programmed?
(off of Steven's look)
Then let me slave your remotes.

He picks up Steven's remotes, punches in a complicated series of commands, then points them at 
each other. As he holds them together he makes a face as if their power is surging through him.

CABLE GUY
Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
alone.

STEVEN
So after this I'll only need one remote
for everything?

CABLE GUY
You know you're pretty good at this. You
could be a cable guy yourself.
(he finishes)
Now let me check your levels.

With amazing alacrity he adjusts color setting, sound controls, closed captioned, etc. Then he 
clicks through the channels. A music video, documentary on Hitler, Oprah Winfrey Show, starving 
kids, Barney, court TV. The Cable Guy watches emotionless.

CABLE GUY
All right. That about does it. I just
have some paperwork for you to fill out.
Sign here.

Steven does.

CABLE GUY
That gave me power of attorney over you.
(beat)
Joking.

Steven laughs. The Cable Guy joins him, but then continues to laugh way too hard for way too 
long. As the laugh ends it quickly turns into an awkward moment. The Cable Guy does not want 
to leave.

CABLE GUY
I'm about finished here.
(beat)
Okay. I feel good about this.

Cable Guy walks to the door.

STEVEN
One thing.

CABLE GUY
(turns back immediately)
Yeah!

STEVEN
I uh I have this friend and he said
he gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he
got free movie channels. Have you ever
heard of anything like that?

CABLE GUY
(deadly serious)
You mean illegal cable?

STEVEN
Uh yes.

CABLE GUY
Who told you that? I want his name.

STEVEN
Forget it.

CABLE GUY
You're offering me a bribe? What you
have just done is illegal, and in this
state if convicted, you could be fined
five-thousand dollars or spend six months
in a correctional facility.

STEVEN
Please that was dumb. I was just
making conversation 

CABLE GUY
(laughs)
I'm just jerking your chain. Wake up
little snoozy. I'll juice you up. All
it is is a push of a button.

He puts his arm around Steven and walks him toward the front door.

STEVEN
Oh, great. How much?

CABLE GUY
Don't worry about it. I couldn't charge
you. Your girl just booted you.
Consider it one guy doing another guy a
solid.

STEVEN
That is so nice.

CABLE GUY
Hey, you're a 'nice' guy. You'd be
surprised how many customers treat you
like shit, like I'm a god damn plumber or
something.
(hands him a card)
Here is my personal beeper number. It's
just for my preferred customers. Never
call the company, they'll just put you on
hold.

STEVEN
Thanks. Really.
(holds up comment card - jokes)
You're gonna get some good marks here.

CABLE GUY
Maybe some day I'll take you out to the
satellite and show you how all this stuff
works. It's really incredible.

STEVEN
Sure. We should do that one day.

CABLE GUY
How 'bout tomorrow?

STEVEN
Tomorrow? Tomorrow's not good.

CABLE GUY
What are you going to do, sit home and
stew about your ex?

STEVEN
No.

CABLE GUY
(insulted)
Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.
Sorry.

STEVEN
(guilty)
You didn't cross the line.

CABLE GUY
No? Cool. I'll pick you up at six-thirty.
On the flip side.

The Cable Guy leaves before Steven can reconsider. Steven cannot believe he just got roped into 
that.

(End Revision - Pink)

14	INT. CITYWIDE LAND DEVELOPERS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Steven is in the middle of a presentation to his co-workers. His boss, HAL DANIELS, looks 
impressed.

Steven pulls a sheet off of an architect's model of a condominium complex.

STEVEN
There are twenty-four classrooms; each
can be converted into a 1400 square foot
home. The facility has two tennis courts,
an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a
stage if the residents decide they want
to perform "Oklahoma."

Everyone laughs. Steven is very good at his job.

STEVEN
The kitsch appeal of living in an old
schoolhouse should be very attractive to
young, upwardly mobile home buyers. And
most important, the structure is
available in foreclosure. If we put down
a cash bid, we're going to steal this
thing.

There is a pause, then everyone applauds. Mr. Daniels walks over to Steven and puts a proud arm 
around him. They speak as the meeting breaks up.

MR. DANIELS
Great work Steve-o. So you're feeling
good?

STEVE
Yeah.

MR. DANIELS
Did I hear something about you having
some troubles at home?

STEVE
Robin and I have been having a difficult
time. I moved out, but I really think
it's only temporary.

MR. DANIELS
Gotcha. I love this project, but it's a
big mother. Know what I mean? If it
fails, corporate's going to have my ass.
I've got confidence in you, but you hear
where I'm coming from, bro?

STEVEN
Absolutely. Now I've got more time than
ever. It's a good thing.
(laughs)
I know I can pull this thing off.

MR. DANIELS
(playfully)
Then what are you doing talking to me?
You've got a lot of work to do. Get to
it!

STEVEN
Thank you. I will.

Hal goes down the stairs to his office. Steven watches him disappear, then turns to his secretary, 
JOAN.

STEVEN
I'll be right back.

14A	INT. SASSY MAGAZINE OFFICES - DAY

Steven walks through the halls looking for Robin's office.

15	OMITTED

16	INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE AT SASSY MAGAZINE - DAY

ROBIN HARRIS, an attractive woman in her late twenties, sits at her desk at "Sassy Magazine." 
Her office is fairly nice, but she is definitely not at the upper level of the company yet. There are 
papers spread all over her desk. On her walls are pictures from the magazine, and articles she has 
written.

Steven peeks his head in her door.

STEVEN
Hello.

Robin's face drops.

ROBIN
Steven, what are you doing here?

STEVEN
I was just in the area. Thought I'd pop
by. How's work? How'd the big teen crush
article come out?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

ROBIN
They liked it.
(beat)
I thought we agreed we weren't going to
see each other for a month.

STEVEN
I know, it's just Daniels accepted my
proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.

ROBIN
That's wonderful, congratulations.

STEVEN
I know I'm breaking the rules, but come
have dinner with me tonight to celebrate.

ROBIN
I don't think we should.

STEVEN
Come on, this is the biggest day of my
career.

ROBIN
Don't put me in this position.

STEVEN
What position? I want to share this with
you.

ROBIN
(feeling pressured)
I love you, but I need to take some time
on my own to see how I feel. You agreed
to this. I mean this is exactly why we
broke up, because you never listen to me.

STEVE
What? Now we're broken up? What
happened to 'trial separation?'

ROBIN
I can't get into this now. If you haven't
noticed, I'm at work.

STEVE
Sorry to disturb you.

He turns to leave.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

ROBIN
(sincerely)
Steven. Congratulations. I know how
much this means to you. You deserve it.

STEVEN
Thanks.

He leaves.

17	OMITTED

17A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SIX-THIRTY P.M.

Steven is watching television. He looks lonely and depressed. He clicks around in a daze, never 
stopping for more than a second.

He hears a horn honking outside.

CABLE GUY (OS)
Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let's go!!!!

ON THE TV - A commercial for Medieval Times Restaurant.

Steven walks over to the window and sees The Cable Guy standing in front of his van, leaning in 
his window honking the horn.

CABLE GUY
Steven!!!!
(waves)
Hey buddy!!! Come on down!!!

Steven waves and then steps back from the window. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at the 
television.

ON THE TV - The local news.

REPORTER
Coming up next a special report,
"Loneliness, America's Silent Killer."

Steven looks back out the window and sees the Cable Guy smiling and waving for him to come 
down.

STEVEN
(begins walking to the door)
What the hell.

18	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DUSK

Steven walks from his apartment to the customized van. On the side of the white van it says, "The 
Cable Company - Get Wired Today."

STEVEN
How's it going?

CABLE GUY
Howdy partner. Climb aboard.

Steven gets in.

19	INT. VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van drives onto the main boulevard.

CABLE GUY
Thanks for coming out. You know most
people think cable is just a simple co-ax
that comes out of the wall. They never
take the time to understand how it works.

STEVEN
Where exactly are we goin?

CABLE GUY
We're going to take a ride on the
information superhighway.

20	EXT. CITY - DUSK

Birds eye P.O.V., shot follows the Cable Guy's van as it drives through the city.

CABLE GUY
It all started in Lansford,
Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.

The van drives up into the hills, finally revealing a huge satellite dish on top of a small mountain, 
overlooking the entire city.

CABLE GUY
I went to Lansford once. It's the Cable
Guy's Mecca. It was very emotional.

21	EXT. WOODED AREA - DUSK

Steven and the Cable Guy get out of the van, and walk down a trail.

CABLE GUY
I come here to think sometimes. To clear
my head.

They turn a corner and the satellite dish is right in front of them. It is enormous. Next to it is a 
one-hundred and fifty foot antenna. Next to that is a small fenced-in shack where the satellite's 
controls are located.

CABLE GUY
There she is. Right now she's sending
entertainment and information to millions
of satisfied citizens.

STEVEN
That's pretty impressive.

CABLE GUY
See, I knew the moment I met you that
you would appreciate this.

The Cable Guy runs to the dish. A few seconds later he appears inside of it.

CABLE GUY
(with wonder)
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on
another. You can do your shopping at
home, or play Mortal Kombat with a friend
in Vietnam. There's no end to the
possibilities.
(waves to Steven)
Come on up! What are you waiting for?!

22	INT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Steven are lying in the middle of the dish, looking up at the night sky.

CABLE GUY
Sometimes I'll sit here and imagine that
there are billions of bits of information
surging through me.

STEVEN
I've watched a lot of TV in my life. I
guess I've always taken it for granted.

CABLE GUY
When I was a kid my mom worked nights.
Never met dad. But the old TV was always
there for me.

STEVEN
I know what you mean. My dad was there,
but he might as well have been gone. My
mom is a stewardess. She was always out
of town.

CABLE GUY
(moved)
That's tough. You must have a lot of
abandonment issues. Reality isn't "Father
Knows Best," it's a kick in the face on
Saturday night. But what doesn't kill us
makes us stronger, right?

STEVEN
(tentative)
You know my brother's a speech therapist.

The Cable Guy sits up. He looks angry.

CABLE GUY
So?

There is a long silence. Steven doesn't know how to react.

STEVEN
Never mind.

The Cable Guy sits back down and pretends Steven never mentioned it.

CABLE GUY
(beat)
So, you're pretty love struck about your
lady, huh?

STEVEN
I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and
she asked me to move out.

CABLE GUY
I hate that.

STEVEN
She said she felt pressured. Can you
believe that?

CABLE GUY
Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I
don't think you listen to her. I think
you try to tell her what she wants to
hear. She wants you to thirst for
knowledge about who she is. All the
complicated splendor that is woman. When
your love is truly giving, it will come
back to you ten-fold.

STEVEN
You're right. That is remarkably
insightful.

CABLE GUY
Yeah, it was Jerry Springer's final
thought on Friday's show.

23	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

The van pulls up in front of Steven's apartment building.

CABLE GUY
You know what? Women are suckers for
"Sleepless in Seattle." It's on HBO this
month. That's your bait right there.

STEVEN
Robin loves that movie.

CABLE GUY
They all do. Next time you talk to her
tell her you're cooking yourself dinner,
and watching it by yourself. Sound like
you're happier than a pig in shit.
She'll come running. Betcha. Then just
play it cool.

STEVEN
Maybe I will.

Steven gets out of the car.

STEVEN
Thanks a lot. I'm embarrassed to say
this, but I don't know your name. What
is it?

CABLE GUY
(touched)
You really want to know my name? You do?
Really? It's Ernie Douglas. But my
friends call me Chip.

STEVEN
I'll see ya' Chip.

Before he can exit the van, the Cable Guy is staring him in the eyes.

CABLE GUY
Let's just remember right now. You know
some people walk through their entire
lives and never find a true friend.
(long pause)
I guess we're the lucky ones.

(End Revised - Pink)

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - The Cable Guy is in slow motion. He blinks once.

STEVEN
Uh good-bye.

CABLE GUY
Later buddy. I'll catch ya' on the
flip side.

Steven exits the van feeling a little uncomfortable.

24	INT. COFFEEHOUSE - NEXT DAY

Steven and Robin are talking. Robin does not look happy to see him.

STEVEN
I don't listen to you. I pretend to
understand but I'm really just saying
what I think you want to hear. So from
now on I'm going to try my best to listen
more because I do love you and am
interested in learning about every detail
about the complicated splendor that is
you.

Robin looks at him, somewhat shocked.

ROBIN
Oh.

STEVEN
I want us to get back together, but I can
see why taking this time might be good
for us. So, I'm not mad.

After a long beat, Robin smiles.

ROBIN
Sometimes time apart is healthy.

STEVEN
You're right. Well, that's what I came
here to say. Look, I've got to get back
to the office.

He starts getting up.

ROBIN
So, are you doing anything tomorrow?

STEVEN
I'm just going to cook myself dinner and
watch a movie. "Sleepless in Seattle" is
on cable.

ROBIN
Really?

STEVEN
If you're around you should drop by and
check out the new apartment.

ROBIN
Okay, maybe I will.

He exits the room. As he does we see a television broadcasting the Sweet case.

ON MTV - Sam Sweet sits behind the defendant's table. TABITHA SOREN is giving the news 
update.

TABITHA SOREN
Today in the Sam Sweet case the
prosecution played the 911 call that Sam
Sweet made the night he murdered his
brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one
month later.

The courtroom listens to a 911 phone call. The transcription is seen on the screen.

SAM SWEET V ON THE TAPE
(crying and babbling)
Hello, please send help. My twin brother
has been shot.

911 OPERATOR
Slow down sir. What happened?

SAM SWEET
Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
four times. I mean I think it was a
shotgun. Who would do such a thing?! I
think it was an Asian gang or something.
They were speaking some other language.

Sam leans over and whispers something in his lawyer's ear.

TABITHA SOREN
Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a rare
interview with Michael Jackson's zoo-
keeper.

25	INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

Steven is playing a pick-up, full court basketball game with some of his friends. It is a competitive, 
but friendly game. Steven is on skins, Rick is on shirts.

STEVEN
Here, here, here.

A player passes to Steven. Rick is covering him. Steven drives to the basket and puts in a lay up.

RICK
(to himself)
Shit! My fault! My fault!

STEVEN
Not your fault. I'm in the zone. There
is no stopping me today.

Play begins again. A player named JEFF takes the ball out, then passes to a heavy-set player who 
catches the ball, then drives to the basket. When he does he twists his ankle, dropping the ball. The 
ball rolls out of bounds into a dark corner of the gym. We follow it as it rolls on the ground until it 
hits a man's sneaker. A pair of hands pick up the ball. The camera tilts up the man's body. It is the 
Cable Guy. He is holding another ball. He starts dribbling the two balls in a circular pattern.

CABLE GUY
Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I
was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd
run the court for a couple of innings.

RICK
(gestures to injured player)
Great. We need another man.

STEVEN
This is Chip Douglas my cable guy.

Rick smiles in recognition.

CABLE GUY
We met about a week ago during a routine
installation, but I feel like I've known
him my whole life.

Steven can't believe this is happening.

RICK
Oh really. That's sweet. All right Chip
Douglas, you're on shirts. Let's play.

CABLE GUY
No, I want to be on Steven's team. I'm
skins.

The Cable Guy quickly takes off his shirt. Steven looks shocked because underneath his clothes he 
is rippled with muscles. The dichotomy between his nerdy face, and his awesome physique is 
scary.

JEFF
I don't care, I'll be shirts. Let's just
play.

CABLE GUY
Wait a sec'. I've got to warm up.

The Cable Guy starts running wind sprints across the court, touching all the main lines. Everyone 
stares at him until he finishes.

CABLE GUY
Let's get it on!

STEVEN
Are you any good?

CABLE GUY
Feed me under the boards and you'll find
out.

Play begins. The shirts inbound to Jeff. The Cable Guy is all over him, covering him as tightly as 
humanly possible. He keeps his hands near Jeff's face, whacks him in the back as he dribbles, etc. 
He couldn't be more annoying. Jeff passes to Rick who drives to the basket and puts up a shot 
which goes in. Rick and Jeff slap hands.

CABLE GUY
(doing the traveling hand signal)
Traveling! That's traveling!

RICK
Yeah, whatever you say Chip.

Everyone runs down the court, ignoring him.

CABLE GUY
All right, so we're playing that type of
game. Prison rules. I get it.

Steven takes the ball out. The cable Guy runs around the court, attempting to get open. He criss 
crosses all over the court.

CABLE GUY
Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I'm
open!

Steven passes to the Cable Guy, who drives to the basket, pushing Jeff out of the way in the 
process. The ball goes in.

CABLE GUY
(does the foul hand signal)
And one! That's definitely a foul!
(to Jeff)
You want to mug me, my wallet is in my
other pants.

STEVEN
(to Cable Guy)
What are you doing?

CABLE GUY
Don't play from fear Steven. We can take
these guys.

MUSIC UP - SLOW MOTION - STEVEN'S P.O.V.

a. The shirts put a shot which doesn't go in. The Cable Guy swings his elbows wildly as he pulls it 
down.
b. The Cable Guy drives to the basket in slow motion violently taking down two men, including 
Rick.
c. Rick drives to the basket. On his way he fakes out Steven who falls to the floor. Rick scores. 
The Cable guy helps Steven up. As the Cable Guy walks across the court he bangs shoulders 
with Rick.
d. The cable Guy passes the ball to Steven, then sets a nasty pick against Rick, who goes down 
hard.

CABLE GUY
Take it to the hole!

Steven is so un-nerved by the Cable Guy's behavior that he misses a simple lay up. Steven grabs 
his own rebound. When he puts up a second shot, Rick gently fouls him. Steven stumbles to the 
ground. The ball does not go in.

CABLE GUY
Hey, are you okay?

He pulls Steven up.

STEVEN
Yeah. I'm fine.

CABLE GUY
Let's switch. I'll cover Rick.

The cable Guy gets in Rick's face and gives him a death stare.

Steven takes out the ball. He passes to a teammate who passes it to the Cable Guy who drives to 
the basket, then literally steps on Rick's back and leaps into the air and dunks the ball.

RICK
(enraged)
What the hell was that? That's it. I've
had enough.

Everyone begins to exit the court.

JEFF
Thanks for bringing your "friend".

The Cable Guy runs up to Rick.

CABLE GUY
Good game.
(slaps Rick on the butt)
You were tough out there. Your play
brought me up to a higher level. I mean
that.

RICK
(dismissive)
Yeah.

He shakes his head and exits with the rest of the players.

STEVEN
What are you doing?

CABLE GUY
It was payback time. I was protecting
you.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

STEVEN
You ruined the game.

CABLE GUY
I don't appreciate your tone Steven.
That's not the way friends speak to each
other.

STEVEN
What are you talking about? I don't even
know you!

CABLE GUY
Well let's fix that. Let me buy you a
Heineken?

STEVEN
No, I'm going home.

Steven turns to leave.

CABLE GUY
Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've
got to go shower up and do some stuff.
I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you
call me or something.

The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the 
cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee.

CABLE GUY
And down low.

Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven 
gives him a low five just so he can leave.

CABLE GUY
(pulls his hand away so Steven misses it)
Too slow. Have a good one.

STEVEN
(as he walks away)
Yeah, have a good one.

26	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT

Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of 
wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message 
machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

MESSAGE VOICE
You have eleven messages.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
(ON THE MACHINE)
Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm
still your mother.

STEVEN'S FATHER
(ON THE MACHINE)
I'm getting on. Steven call your mother.

CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a
ring. I'm at 555-4329.
(beep)
What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If
you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up.
Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to
you then.

Steven stops chopping.

CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
(beep)
Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when
you get in. I'll be here pretty much all
night. Bye.
(beep tone)
Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a
call when you get a chance.
(beep tone)
I was just taking a whiz, thought you
might have called. Okay later.
(beep tone)
Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to
it, thought it might have been you. All
right, bye.

Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the 
rest of the calls.

CABLE GUY
(fast forwards)
We're having ourselves quite a little
game of phone tag here. You're it!
(fast forwards)
I was just blow drying my hair and I
thought I heard the phone ringing.
(fast forwards)
you're a tough man to reach.
(fast forwards)
I guess you're too busy to call your
friends.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then 

CABLE GUY
(ON THE MACHINE)
(long beat - then quiet and distant)
Shit.

The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed 
casually, but looks beautiful.

STEVEN
Hey, good to see you.

There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello.

STEVEN
Come on in. What do you think of the
place?

She looks at the odd placement of furniture.

ROBIN
You made some interesting choices laying
out the room.

STEVEN
(embarrassed)
That's actually where the movers put the
furniture. I'm gonna change it, very 
soon.

ROBIN
No, I like it.

27	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation.

ROBIN
So how's work?

STEVEN
Work's good.

ROBIN
How's Hal?

STEVEN
Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

ROBIN
It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

STEVEN
I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

ROBIN
It's nice to see you doing so well.

STEVEN
Well, it's nice just to see you.
(looks at his watch)
Hey, it should be starting.

They sit on the couch. Robin moves to sit in closer to Steven. Steven turns on the television. The 
screen is filled with white noise. The sound is loud static. He changes channels looking for the 
signal. Then fumbles with the remote control as he attempts to lower the volume.

STEVEN
Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.

ROBIN
It's alright. We can watch it another
night.

STEVEN
No, no. We really should see it now.
Now's a good time.

He plays with the remote, hoping it will magically come back. It doesn't.

STEVEN
Wait, wait. I know what to do.

He walks over to the phone, then pulls the Cable Guy's beeper number out of his wallet. He dials 
it, then presses the number in.

STEVEN
The Cable Guy's a friend of mine. I'll
just page him. We'll have this fixed in
no time.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

Steven dials the Cable Guy's beeper number into the phone. The moment he is finished dialing 

THERE IS A KNOCK - THE CAMERA WHIP PANS TO THE DOOR

Steven walks to the door and opens it. Standing there is the Cable Guy looking dark and 
disturbed, different than we've ever seen him before. Steven is startled.

STEVEN
That was fast.

CABLE GUY
Is there a problem with your service?

STEVEN
Yeah my cable went out.

Steven pushes him out into the hall.

CABLE GUY
Really?

The Cable Guy holds up a cut cable cord.

CABLE GUY
So you called me. Interesting how you
call when you need something. Is that how
you treat people?

STEVEN
I've been really busy. You've got to get
my cable going, Robin is here. This is
really important.

He peeks in to get a look at Robin. They make momentary eye contact. Steven pushes him back 
out.

CABLE GUY
But calling me back isn't?

STEVEN
I'm sorry. Please, you've got to help me.

CABLE GUY
Why should I help you? I gave you free
cable. What have you ever done for me?

STEVEN
Anything you want. Name it  quickly.

CABLE GUY
Tomorrow night, we hang out.

STEVEN
Fine, whatever you want.

CABLE GUY
God bless you. You're too good to me.

The Cable Guy walks over to a fuse type box, turns one knob, then walks back to Steven.

CABLE GUY
(loud-normally)
All set.

STEVEN
So what's with the cut cord?

CABLE GUY
(nonchalantly)
That's for effect. See ya' tomorrow
Steven.
(conspiratorially)
She's pretty. And don't kiss her. Don't
even touch her. Fight the urge at all
costs. It will pay off later with

He makes a motion which implies sex.

CABLE GUY
Enjoy the flick.

The Cable Guy walks away. Steven walks back inside.

ROBIN
Who was that?

STEVEN
Nobody.

Steven sits down next to Robin. Robin moves next to him. Steven looks very happy.

28	ON THE TV

A scene from the film "Sleepless in Seattle."

The camera pulls out and reveals the Cable Guy watching the film in the back of his van  alone. 
We cannot see much of the inside of the van because the only light is that of the television, but we 
can tell that he lives there.

29	(SCENE 29 OMITTED)

30	EXT. PARKING LOT - DUSK

The Cable Guy and Steven walk across a parking lot. Steven has his eyes closed.

CABLE GUY
Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of
a weird mood. How'd things go with you?
Keep 'em closed.

STEVEN
Pretty well. We'll see. Look, about the
other night. I didn't appreciate you --

CABLE GUY
Don't peek. I want this to be a
surprise.

STEVEN
I really don't need to be surprised.
Where are we going?

CABLE GUY
Only the best restaurant in town.

They walk around a corner.

CABLE GUY
Okay, here we are. Open sesame.

Steven opens his eyes.

The camera moves behind then and reveals an enormous faux castle with a big sign on it which 
says "MEDIEVAL TIMES RESTAURANT."

STEVEN
Medieval Times?

CABLE GUY
I know what you're thinking. Don't
worry, I'm buying.

31	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER

The Cable Guy and Steven are walking to their table. All the seating overlooks a large, circular 
arena, the kind a rodeo is held in. The entire restaurant/arena is designed in Medieval themed 
decor. All of the staff are dressed as knights, sorcerers, royalty, etc.

(Revision Ends - Pink)

STEVEN
Funny. I never thought I would ever
come here.

CABLE GUY
I love this place. I come here twice a
week.

A Hispanic woman with a large butt walks by. The Cable Guy is transfixed.

CABLE GUY
Oh man, that's my look. I love big
butts. Ow, that hurts.

He grabs his crotch and squeezes, as if it's the only way he can control himself.

CABLE GUY
There oughta be a law. Man she is hot.
It's just not fair.

STEVEN
(gestures to him squeezing his crotch)
Please don't.

CABLE GUY
You know what I need right now? Pooooon
tang. And I'm not talking about the
place in Vietnam.

STEVEN
Good to know.

They sit down. The WAITRESS walks over. She is dressed in peroid clothes, but is not 
enthusiastic about her job.

WAITRESS
(flatly)
Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is
Melinda. I'll be your serving wench.
May I get you something from the bar
keep?

CABLE GUY
(too into it)
Dost thou have a mug of ale for me
and me mate? He has been pitched in
battle for a fortnight an has a King's
thirst for the beer thust thou might have
for thust.

WAITRESS
(uninspired)
I'll be right back my lord.

The Cable Guy puts something together.

CABLE GUY
There you go.

He hands Steven a paper crown. They both put theirs on.

STEVEN
Thanks for the help.

The Cable Guy sees something. His eyes widen.

CABLE GUY
Steven, don't turn around, but there is a
woman eyeing you like you are a piece of
meat and she hasn't eaten in a week.

Steven acts like he isn't interested, but he is.

STEVEN
Really? What does she look like?

CABLE GUY
Shoe's a hottie. I wish she was checking
me out. Man -- she is on fire! Total
robo-babe.

STEVEN
Are you serious?

CABLE GUY
Don't look.

STEVEN
I've got to look.

CABLE GUY
Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like
you are looking for the waitress.

Steven puts up his hand, and turns as if he's going to call for the waitress. He sees the woman. She 
is in her sixties, and probably wasn't attractive at any stage of her life. Steven turns back to the 
cable Guy, annoyed.

CABLE GUY
Ha-ha. I'm just messing with your mind.
But you fell for it man. You are one
horny Indian Chief.

STEVEN
(not laughing)
You got me.

CABLE GUY
So what did you want to rap about?

The trumpets go off, the lights go down and the show begins.

CABLE GUY
Hold that thought. Show's on.

The Cable Guy turns and looks at a stage that stands at one end above the arena.

32	ON THE STAGE - A MAN WHO LOOKS LIKE ALAN RICKMAN IN "ROBIN 
HOOD" SPEAKS TO THE CROWD

HOST
Welcome to a magnificent journey into the
past. This is Medieval Times!

The entire crowd, filled completely with white trash tourists, applauds.

HOST
Are you prepapred for a night of feasting
and sport the likes of which ye will
never forget?!

The audience applauds.

HOST
I charge you to stand up on your feet and
cheer for your section's knight!

ON THE STANDS - Each section of the crowd is painted a color that corresponds with a knight. 
The Cable Guy stands up and cheers like he is at a wrestling match. Steven remains seated.

CABLE GUY
Let the games begin! The Red Knight
rules! Blue Knight! You're going down!
Going down!

An embarrassed Steven applauds politely. The Cable Guy sits down.

33	INT. MEDIEVAL TIMES - LATER

ON THE FLOOR - In the center of the room two Knights are fighting with swords while on 
horseback.

ON STEVEN AND THE CABLE GUY - They are eating whole chickens with their bare hands 
while watching the show.

STEVEN
(to the Watiress)
Could I get a knife and fork?

WAITRESS
There were no utensils in Medieval Times,
so there are no utensils at 'Medieval
Times.' Do you want a refill on that
Pepsi?

STEVEN
There were no utensils, but there was
Pepsi?

WAITRESS
Look, I have a lot of tables to get to.

The waitress exits.

CABLE GUY
(stands up - yells to the competitors)
Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no
mercy!

The two knights fight with swords. After a few moments of battle the Red Knight wins.

The crowd erupts. The Cable Guy goes crazy.

CABLE GUY
(to Steven)
Come on, get into it, we won!

Releuctantly, Steven stands up and applauds.

STEVEN
(halfheartedly)
Way to go Red Knight. Good job of
killing. Good work.

Steven and the Cable Guy sit down.

CABLE GUY
So, what were you saying before?

STEVEN
(tentatively)
How do I put this? I've really enjoyed
hanging out with you, but...

CABLE GUY
That's why I became a cable guy. To make
friends like you. Every time I walk up to
a new door, that door is a possibility
for friendship. When I walked in your
apartment I knew there was something
there. I just knew it.

STEVEN
(sotto)
Oh lord.
(tries to get back on track)
I want you to know --

The lights change. Trumpets play a fanfare. The host walks out onto the stage, interrupting 
Steven.

HOST
We have reached the climax of our
competition good people! Now, two noble
men from our audience will battle to the
death to resolve a grievance. Will a
Master...
(looks at his clipboard)
Steven M. Bartowsky and Lord Ernie
Douglas make you way to the fighting
pit!

A spotlight shines on them. Steven is shocked.

STEVEN
What's going on?

CABLE GUY
We're going to do battle. It'll be fun.

STEVEN
Is this a normal part of the show?

CABLE GUY
No, but I give all the Knights free
cable. They said it would be cool if we
just went at it for a little while.

Two PIMPLY FACED SERFS from the show come and lead them away.

STEVEN
Is this safe?

CABLE GUY
That's what the armor's for.

34	INT. FIGHTING PIT - LATER

Steven and the Cable Guy are being dressed in armor by the two serfs. The Cable Guy could not 
be happier. Steven is freaked out.

STEVEN
What are we supposed to do? We've got to
be careful we don't hurt each other.

The Cable Guy doesn't answer him. He has his game face on.

CABLE GUY
I cannot listen to any of your
instructions for you are my sworn enemy,
and are about to meet your demise.

Before Steven can answer him the trumpets blare.

HOST
Let the battle begin. Come now people,
let me hear your voices!

The crowd cheers. Music plays. The serfs hand them each a sword and shield, then walk them to 
the center of the pit.

The Cable Guy crouches in a war-like position. He begins to circle Steven like a cat. Steven 
mirrors him, not sure of what to do.

STEVEN
Just take it easy.

The Cable Guy runs at Steven, and swings his sword. In fear, Steven puts his shield over his head. 
The sword smashes into it sending sparks into the air. The Cable Guy darts toward Steven and 
pokes him several times with his sword. Each time Steven blocks it with either his sword or his 
shield.

STEVEN
(enraged)
What are you doing?!

CABLE GUY
(matter of fact)
I'm trying to kill you.

The Cable Guy grabs a mace (a stick with a chain and ball attached to it) off of a weapon filled 
wall and runs at Steven, swinging with abandon. Steven blocks the deadly mace with his shield.

STEVEN
Hey, watch it!

The Cable Guy leaps onto Steven. Then he speaks into his ear as he pushes him down onto the 
ground.

CABLE GUY
This is just like when Spock had to fight
Kirk on 'Star Trek.' Best friends forced
to do battle.

Steven gets angry and pushes the Cable Guy off of him. He swings at the Cable Guy with his 
sword, just missing him. The Cable Guy rolls on the ground and pops back up in the air.

CABLE GUY
That's the spirit. Let's give 'em a good
show.

Steven charges at the Cable Guy, swinging wildly. It is a real battle now. He bangs away at the 
Cable Guy's mace until he knocks it out of his hands. The Cable Guy runs backwards, then falls on 
the ground.

By the look in his eyes we can tell that the Cable Guy's feelings are hurt.

CABLE GUY
So that's how it's gonna be, huh? All
right. If you want to play rought, Daddy
can play rough.

The Cable Guy charges at Steven with his shield. He upper cuts the shield to Steven's face, 
sending him to the ground.

The Cable Guy runs to the wall and grabs a huge battle ax, a four foot long stick with a fancy 
silver blade on the end of it. He swings it in circles like a Japanese master. Steven grabs a similar 
weapon, and then begin to circle each other.

STEVEN
Chip, this isn't funny! Will you stop
it!

CABLE GUY
The name is Spock. If we don't battle to
the death, they'll kill us both. Good-bye
Jim.

He swings his sword, and they battle 'Star Trek' style. The Cable Guy begins to sing the "Star Trek 
Battle Music" as they fight.

STEVEN
This isn't 'Star Trek!'

MUSIC UP: STAR TREK BATTLE MUSIC

They bang the handles of their battle axes together, jockeying for position. The Cable Guy pushes 
Steven away from him, then takes a huge swing, but Steven leaps in the air over the blade. The 
Cable Guy swings over his head, and Steven blocks it with his ax handle. They continue to swing 
and roll in a vicious battle.

Then the Cable Guy takes a swing which Steven is unable to block. The battle ax cuts through part 
of Steven's protection.
STEVEN
(looking down)
Jesus.

The Cable Guy runs to a horses' entrance. There is a long pause, and then we hear the sound of 
pounding horse hooves. A moment later the Cable Guy rides out on a horse holding a jousting 
stick.

The show's host runs up to Steven.

HOST
Quickly, muster a top your steed.
(Steven doesn't move - the host drops character)
Get on the god damn horse! I don't think
he's kidding!

Left with no choice, Steven jumps on a horse and grabs a joust. The host smacks Steven's horse 
sending it straight toward the charging Cable Guy.
STEVEN
Don't do this!
CABLE GUY
Jim, we have no choice!
STEVEN
Oh my god.

They run toward each other. A horrible game of chicken. Neither gives in. When they reach one 
another Steven knocks the Cable Guy off his horse with his jousting stick.
The Cable Guy flies through the air, lands on his back. Steven rides to him. Jumps off his horse, 
throws off his helmet.
STEVEN
(concerned)
Are you okay?

The Cable Guy sits up and smile at him.
CABLE GUY
Well done good sir. You are the victor,
but we shall meet again.

The two serfs put Steven on a chair connected to two poles. They carry him to the center of the 
arena in victory. The crowd cheers wildly. Steven feels the adrenaline rush. He holds up his arms 
in triumph, and smiles.
DISSOLVE TO LATER:
35	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
They are walking up the stairs.
CABLE GUY
You've got a real warrior's instinct.
STEVEN
I've got to admit there's a real feeling
of power holding that jousting stick.
CABLE GUY
If Robin saw you tonight, she would be
begging you to take her back. I'm
telling you these knights get laid all
the time.
STEVEN
We should go again next week.
CABLE GUY
Easy there Lancelot.

Steven opens the door to his apartment.
36	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
Steven pops into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine.
MACHINE
You have zero messages.
CABLE GUY
Nobody loves ya.
(grabs a beer from the fridge)
Hey, I think I left my staple gun in the
living room the other day. Could you be
a pal?

Steven walks to the living room.
36AA	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Steven turns on the lights.
CABLE GUY
What do you think?

Steven's entire stereo system and TV have been replaced with a sixty-five inch television, laser disc 
player, karaoke machine and a brand new stereo system. All top of the line.
STEVEN
What is this?
CABLE GUY
I took the liberty of updating your in
home entertainment system. I got you the
big screen, plus THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his
pants.
STEVEN
You went in my house when I wasn't home?
CABLE GUY
How else was I supposed to get the stuff
in here? Magic?
STEVEN
How much did this cost?
CABLE GUY
Practically nothing. I have a connection.
Preferred customer. I hook him up, he
hooks me up.
STEVEN
Look, I can't accept this. I wouldn't
feel right.
CABLE GUY
Yes but you give me something so much
more valuable friendship.
STEVEN
And you've given me friendship, so we're
even.
(beat)
Really, don't take it personally, but
you've got to take it back.
CABLE GUY
(sadly)
Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck
works all week. Is it all right if I
leave it here till Saturday?
STEVEN
(guilty)
Sure, no problem. And don't get me
wrong. I really appreciate the gesture.
CABLE GUY
Mm-hmm.
(beat)
Staple gun?
STEVEN
Oh, right.

Steven picks up the staple gun. The Cable Guy pulls out a leather pouch. Steven drops the staple 
gun in the pouch. The Cable Guy never touches it.
36A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY
Steven dials the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads "HELLO STEVEN - HAVE A 
WONDERFUL DAY."
STEVEN
(into the phone)
Robin, it's Steven again. I'm still
trying to reach you. Okay, I'm at work.
Call me.

He hangs up. He is getting frustrated. The door opens. Hal Daniels sticks his head in, but does not 
enter.
MR. DANIELS
How's it going?
STEVEN
Good.
MR. DANIELS
(long beat)
Good good?
STEVEN
Great.
MR. DANIELS
Good. Keep it up.

He leaves. The phone rings.
SECRETARY
(through the intercom)
Robin on line two.

Steven lights up. He takes a deep breath, then answers the phone.
STEVEN
Hey, I had the best time the other night.
When am I going to get you on my couch
again?

36B	INT. VAN - DAY
The Cable Guy is driving around. He speaks on a cellular phone.
CABLE GUY
Well tonight's not looking too good. How
about tomorrow?
STEVEN
Chip?
CABLE GUY
I knew I'd get you on the phone that way.
Listen, that equipment will be history
the day after tomorrow. It sure would be
a pity to leave that karaoke machine a
virgin.
STEVEN
What do you mean?
CABLE GUY
Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke
jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a
few butts. Later gator.

37	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - SATURDAY NIGHT
CLOSE UP - AN OLD MAN'S FACE INTENSELY SINGING "AMERICAN WOMAN."
We pull out to reveal we are in Steven's living room. It is populated with about twenty odd 
looking misfits mingling and dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very 
uncomfortable.
37AA	INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Steven is on the phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink from the 
fridge.
STEVEN
Hey Robin. What's up? Did you get my
message?

37A	INT. - ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT
The scene intercuts between the two locations. Robin is dressed up, and on her way out.
ROBIN
Yes. You left me five messages. It king
of freaked me out.
STEVEN
Sorry. I've been trying to reach you
'cause I'm having a party.
You've got to come over.
ROBIN
(listens for a beat)
I can't. I'm going to dinner with
someone.
STEVEN
Dinner? What, like a date?
ROBIN
Not really a date.
STEVEN
You've got a date?! I thought things
were going well between us.
ROBIN
They are.
STEVEN
So why are you going out on a date?
ROBIN
I made it before we got together the
other night. I knew you would freak out.
STEVEN
I'm not freaking out.
ROBIN
Yes, you are freaking out.
STEVEN
I'm not. I just can't believe you would
do this.
ROBIN
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm allowed
to date. It's not like we're back
together. We had a good time the other
night, and you're already pressuring me.
STEVEN
(pissy)
Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun.
ROBIN
I will.
STEVEN
Fine. Bye.

Steven hangs up the phone. The Cable Guy appears, and hands him a beer.
CABLE GUY
This is just a sign that you need to live
a little. She's having fun, and you
should too.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
STEVEN
You're probably right.
CABLE GUY
Damn right I'm right.
STEVEN
Oh, I got you a little something.

He hands a box to the Cable Guy.
CABLE GUY
I thought you said we were even. You're
breaking the rules.
STEVEN
So shoot me.

He opens it. The box says, "Lose Your Lisp in Thirty Days." The Cable Guy is so moved he 
cannot speak.
STEVEN
My brother said it might help with your
lisp.

The Cable Guy looks Steven in the eye for a long beat, then hugs him hard.
CABLE GUY
Words cannot express
(he is too moved to finish his sentence)
STEVEN
It's no big deal.
CABLE GUY
Yes it is.

He stares at Steven until it makes him uncomfortable.
CABLE GUY
Now I'm on a mission. This has got to be
the best party ever! Let's rock.

37B	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
They walk into the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing "Superfreak." Everyone's 
having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform mingling with the crowd.
(Revision Ends - Blue)
STEVEN
You've got plenty of friends.
CABLE GUY
These people are acquaintances. They're
not ride to the airport friends, like us.
(sees something)
Whoa, chick alert at three o'clock. A
real barn burner. Don't look.
STEVEN
You're playing with me again.
CABLE GUY
No sirree Steven. This woman is all over
you like a lamp-shade.
STEVEN
Shut up.

He turns and sees a stunning woman standing in the middle of a group of male and female misfits. 
When he looks at her, she smiles. He quickly turns back.
CABLE GUY
Did it just get hotter in here?
(grabs his crotch)
Oh, that hurts.
STEVEN
Who'd she come with?
CABLE GUY
I don't know, but she looks pretty
available to me. I'd strike while the
iron is hot. He who hesitates,
masturbates, know what I'm saying?

ANGLE ON
A nerdy, balding man walks over to Rick.
ODD MAN
He sure can throw a party. Chip's an
incredible man. I really admire him.
RICK
Where do you know him from?
ODD MAN
He hooked up my cable. Didn't charge me
either. That's the kind of guy he is.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)
ANGLE ON
Steven slowly walks over to the pretty woman.
STEVEN
Hey. I'm Steven.
WOMAN
Heather.
STEVEN
Can I get you something to drink?
HEATHER
Sure. I'll have a shot of tequila if you
will.
STEVEN
Coming right up.

37C	INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER
AT THE KARAOKE AREA - Steven and Heather are singing "You're the One that I Want" from 
"Grease." They are both drunk, and having a great time.
The Cable Guy walks over to Rick.
CABLE GUY
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.
RICK
Steven invited me.

The Cable Guy looks at Steven and Heather.
CABLE GUY
Look at him. Have you ever seen him so
alive? He's changing, Rick. You've got
to learn to live with that.
RICK
I don't know what your story is "Chip
Douglas," but I'm going to find out.
CABLE GUY
Oooh. How dramatic.

The song ends. Rick walks away. He waves to Steven as he heads out. Steven runs over to him.
RICK
I'm getting out of here.
STEVEN
(drunk)
Why? This is a great party. This girl
is really into me.
RICK
You're whacked man. That guy is bad
news.
STEVEN
You don't even know him. You're just mad
'cause he kicked your ass in basketball.
RICK
I can't even deal. I'm outta here.

ON THE CABLE GUY - At the karaoke area. He speaks into the microphone.

CABLE GUY
Hello everyone. First of all I'd like to
thank Steven for being such a terific
host.

Steven smiles, and does a half wave to everyone as they applaud.

CABLE GUY
Don't forget to kick in some spinach for
the beer. Steven ain't made of money.
And I expect some of you to join in the
clean up crew.

OFF DUTY COP
Sing something! Do a song!

CABLE GUY
(false coyness)
No I really couldn't.

ODD MAN
Come on! Do your song!

CABLE GUY
Okay, just to stop that guy from begging.
This number is dedicated to all of the
ladies in the house.

He puts on a Janet Jackson type microphone, then breaks into a fast paced rap of the song "Bust A 
Move," accompanied by elaborate dance moves.

CABLE GUY
(rapping)
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

During the musical break the Cable Guy begins to break dance. He knows all the moves. The 
robot, the spider, the crab. He looks like a deranged cast member or "Electric Boogaloo." The 
guests go crazy.

ANGLE ON STEVEN AND HEATHER

STEVEN
You sounded just like Olivia Newton John.

HEATHER
I've been practicing for years.

STEVEN
(laughs)
So what do you do?

HEATHER
I can barely hear you. Do you want to
talk in the other room?

STEVEN
Oh okay.

They walk into Steven's bedroom.

ON THE CABLE GUY

CABLE GUY
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

38	INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Heather are sitting on the bed talking.

STEVEN
She says she wants a break, and that's
fine with me. I think I needed some time
also.

HEATHER
Yeah. I know what you mean.

She leans in and kisses him.

39	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The cable Guy has got all of the guests in a frenzy.

CABLE GUY
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

40	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Heather are kissing passionately. Suddenly the door flies open, and the Cable Guy 
dances into the room, takes out a Polaroid instamatic camera and FLASHES A PICTURE of 
them. Steven is disoriented. Behind the Cable Guy in the hallway is everyone from the party.

CABLE GUY
(Lyrics to "Bust A Move.")

He continues to rap, dance and flash pictures of everyone as he dances out of the room.

41	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING

Steven walks into the living room looking a little disheveled. The Cable Guy is cooking him 
breakfast.

CABLE GUY
Good morning sleepy head. I hope you
don't mind, I crashed on the couch.
Bacon and eggs coming up.

STEVEN
Where did Heather go?

CABLE GUY
I heard her slip out early this morning.

STEVEN
What a night. That was just what I
needed.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

CABLE GUY
You look like a new man.

STEVEN
I feel like a new man. I was getting so
used to being rejected. I really liked
her.

CABLE GUY
Hey, it was my treat.

STEVEN
(taken aback)
What do you mean it was "your treat?"

CABLE GUY
You know, I bought this time, you buy
next time.

STEVEN
(getting concerned)
Buy what?

CABLE GUY
You know, the women.

STEVEN
You mean Heather is a prostitute?

CABLE GUY
Of course she is. Do you think a woman
like that would hang out with us if we
weren't paying? Don't tell me you didn't
know.

STEVEN
I can't believe this.

He sits in a chair, and leans over in pain.

CABLE GUY
She's clean I assure you. I tried her out
last week to make sure she was top
quality, and I'm as healthy as a horse. Not
a drip. She's the best, ask any of my
friends.

Steven cringes.

STEVE
You've got to be kidding? Please tell me
she's a friend of yours. You're just
playing with my mind again, right?

CABLE GUY
I wish I had friends like that.

STEVEN
Get out of my house!

CABLE GUY
Don't be ashamed of yourself. I know she
was a working girl, but she kind of liked
you. You might have been able to
get a freebie.

STEVEN
Out, now! I don't ever want to see you
again.
(to himself)
Robin is never going to forgive me.

CABLE GUY
I'll tell you how to handle that. Don't
tell her. You want to get her back, I'll
help you get her back.

STEVEN
I don't want your help. I want you to
leave.
(gestures to the TV)
And take that stuff out of here.

CABLE GUY
(calmly)
Whatever. I can take a hint. I'll see
ya'.

The Cable Guy exits.

42	OMITTED

43	EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

P.O.V. Shot - Robin and a date enter the restaurant.

We move to reveal the Cable Guy driving up in his van. He watches them from across the street. A 
moment later he heads inside.

44	INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Cable Guy enters the restaurant. The HOSTESS walks over to him.

HOSTESS
May I help you?

CABLE GUY
No, I'm meeting someone here.

He looks around the restaurant, then spots Robin and a handsome, chiseled man at a table. They 
are on a date. The Cable Guy looks angry. He walks to the restroom.

45	INT. RESTROOM - NIGHT

An OLDER BATHROOM ATTENDANT stands in front of the sinks. On the counter sits a 
variety of toiletries. A MAN washes his hands. The bathroom attendant hands him some paper 
towels. The man puts a tip in the basket, and exits.

BATHROOM ATTENDANT
Most appreciated.

The Cable Guy walks over to the bathroom attendant. He dramatically whips out a twenty dollar 
bill, and puts it in front of the bathroom attendant's nose.

CABLE GUY
You've been working hard. Take a break.

46	INT. RESTAURANT - A LITTLE LATER

Robin is talking to her date RAY. He is handsome, and somewhat goofy. They have empty salad 
plates in front of them.

RAY
My brother and I wanna start our own sun
block company. But the twist is, it's
only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki.
We haven't decided yet. Maybe BlockSki.
Do you think that sounds good?

ROBIN
BlockSki? That sounds right.

RAY
So, Gail told me you're just coming off a
relationship.

ROBIN
Well, not really. We're kind of in a
holding pattern. He wants more of a
commitment, but I don't think I'm ready.
I just want to have a good time for a
while.

RAY
Then we got to get you on a Skidoo!

ROBIN
Skidoo?

RAY
High powered snow mobile. It'll blow
your mind. It flies over powder like
it's glass.

Their waitress passes by.

RAY
(impatiently)
Hey, how are you doing on that chicken?
Have the eggs hatched yet? Thanks.

Robin is mortified by his behavior.

RAY
So, how's your work going?

ROBIN
It's been crazy. They just hired a 

RAY
Hold that thought. I have to use the rest
room. Be right back.

He leaves. Robin looks relieved to have a break.

47	INT. RESTROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ray enters the restroom. The Cable Guy is now wearing the bathroom attendant's blue shirt white 
pants and a thin fake moustache. A DISTINGUISHED MAN walks over and washes his hands.

MAN
(to Cable guy)
Towel please.

CABLE GUY
My pleasure.

The man puts out his hand to take the paper towel, but the Cable Guy doesn't hand it to him, he 
grabs the man's hands and surrounds them with several paper towels, and begins drying them 
furiously. When he's done, he takes a beat and wipes them over and over, just to make sure they're 
dry. The man is aghast.

CABLE GUY
Enjoy your meal

The man exits. Ray walks toward the stalls.

CABLE GUY
Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn't
it?

RAY
(curt)
Yeah.

CABLE GUY
But I guess the weather's always pleasant
in here. The winters are remarkably mild.

He laughs at his own joke. Ray walks into the handicapped stall.

CABLE GUY (OS)
If you need anything, just let me know.
Anything at all.

RAY
(getting annoyed)
I think I can handle it.

Ray unzips his fly, and prepares to pee standing up. Suddenly, as if out of thin air, the Cable Guy 
is standing right behind him. He speaks into Ray's ear, startling him.

CABLE GUY
I'm here to serve you.

RAY
Jesus! Get out of here!

CABLE GUY
Most people never bother to take
advantage of all my services, for
instance 

The Cable Guy grabs the back of Ray's shirt, kicks his feet out from under him, and slams his face 
into the toilet bowl, sloshing it around. Ray struggles, but the Cable Guy is too strong.

CABLE GUY
I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is
so very important.

He pulls his face out.
CABLE GUY
Then once you're done I have a variety of
skin care products which can make you
look years younger.

The Cable Guy kicks the door open, and pulls Ray toward the counter. He grabs a bottle of lotion.

CABLE GUY
This lotion is superb at removing liver
spots.

He slaps it onto Ray's face.

CABLE GUY
This one is an excellent moisturizer.

The Cable Guy pours some after cologne into his hands, and rubs his hands together as if he's 
about to put it on Ray's face.

CABLE GUY
And one can never underestimate the
effects of a good cologne.

The Cable Guy rears back and slaps Ray across the face.

CABLE GUY
(sniffs)
Mm High Karate. And now a touch of
powder.

He takes a large powder puff, and smashes it into Ray's face temporarily blinding him.

CABLE GUY
(grabs a tweezer)
Ooh, I almost forget, it's oh so very
important to be properly tweezed.

The Cable Guy plucks several hairs out from between Ray's eyebrows.

CABLE GUY
You're on a big date, you'll need fresh
breath.

He takes a clear jar of combs, and pours the blue fluid and the combs into Ray's mouth.

CABLE GUY
Whoops, that's not mouth wash. But that
reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.

The Cable Guy combs his soaking wet hair into a very goofy looking side part.

CABLE GUY
Looking good, now let's dry you off.

He runs Ray face first into the starting button of an automatic hand dryer. It turns on. The Cable 
Guy puts his face right up next to the air.

CABLE GUY
Now suck it. Suck the air!

Ray hesitantly puts his mouth around the nozzle, and his cheeks start fluttering like an astronaut 
experiencing heavy G-Force.

CABLE GUY
from this angle you look just like Neil
Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I
believe you have the "right stuff."

The Cable Guy pulls him away, and smashes his face into the tip basket.

CABLE GUY
Don't worry about the tip. But I've got
one for you.
(whispers into his ear)
Stay away from Robin. She's taken.

He tosses him out the door.

47A	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

The door opens, and Ray falls to the floor.

47B	INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Robin sits alone at her table. She looks at her watch. In the background the Cable Guy slips out.

48	OMITTED

49	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven is watching television while eating a TV dinner.

ON THE TV - LOCAL TELEVISION NEWS

ANCHOR MAN
Here's a bizarre story from downtown,
where a man was beaten in a restroom by
an assailant disguised as a bathroom
attendant. The victim has been unable to
speak since the unmotivated attack.

We see the image of a shaken up RAY being led out of the restaurant by two police officers.

ANCHOR MAN
A police sketch artist put together this
drawing from witnesses' descriptions.

We see a drawing which looks a little like the Cable Guy. In it he has a moustache and appears to 
be Hispanic. Steven looks carefully. Does he know that man? Nah. He changes the channel.

ON THE TV - the FOX logo flies up, followed by a slick promo for a FOX Movie-of-the-Week 
on the Sam Sweet trial.

ANOUNCER (V.O.)
Tonight on Fox, the true story behind the
trial that's captured the nation.

We see ERIC ROBERTS holding a shotgun, pointed at another scared ERIC ROBERTS.

ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
The jury may still be out, but the
chilling facts are in. Eric Roberts, in
his dramatic debut is Sam and Stan Sweet.
"Brother, Sweet Brother: The Killing of
Stanton Sweet." Tonight on Fox.

49A	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The Cable Guy walks over to a FEMALE NEIGHBOR.

CABLE GUY
Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin Harris?

FEMALE NEIGHBOR
(points)
It's right upstairs.

50	INT. ROBIN'S HOME - NEXT DAY

There is a LOUD KNOCK. Robin walks to the door and opens it without undoing the chain.

ROBIN
Who is it?

The Cable Guy sticks his face as far into the crack of the door as possible.

CABLE GUY
It's the Cable Guy.

ROBIN
There's no problem with my cable.

CABLE GUY
I've got an upgrade order for one Robin
Harris. The Rainbow package, that's every
pay channel available.

ROBIN
I didn't order this.

CABLE GUY
Apparently you've got a secret admirer.

She unlocks the chain, and the Cable Guy quickly steps inside.

ROBIN
Was it a man named Steven?

CABLE GUY
I can't tell you.

ROBIN
Come on.

CABLE GUY
No, I promised Steven I wouldn't say.

He gave it away on purpose. They both laugh.

CABLE GUY
Whoops, I slipped. Well you didn't hear
it from me.

51	INT. AIR DUCT - LATER

The Cable Guy is in the air duct. He is pulling cord. He reaches an area of the duct which opens 
up to a vent. He looks through and sees Robin changing in the bedroom. He tries not to look at 
Robin undress. He turns away.

CABLE GUY
I'm sorry Steven. I'm just a man.

He turns back and looks at her. He notices a birthmark on her back.

52	INT. APARTMENT - LATER

The Cable Guy is on his way out.

CABLE GUY
That about does it. Enjoy.

ROBIN
So, are you a friend of Steven's?

CABLE GUY
I'm proud to say I am. I installed his
cable recently, and we just hit it off.

ROBIN
That's right. You fixed his cable the
other night.
(suspicious)
So you guys are going out a lot?

CABLE GUY
Not really. That man is devoted to you.
You know I'm probably crossing a boundary
telling you this, but he's really crazy
about you.

ROBIN
Did he say that?

CABLE GUY
Only every five minutes. Quite frankly,
I'm sick of hearing it. No, I'm just
kidding with you.
(looks her deeply in the eyes)
He's a good man. He mentioned that you
guys have had some problems.

ROBIN
Well, it's a little complicated.

CABLE GUY
It always is. You know I asked a woman to
marry me once. She said she wanted to
think about it. We agreed to take some
time apart to re-assess our feelings. To
give each other
(mockingly)
space.
(chokes up)
Well, she is no longer with us.

ROBIN
I'm so sorry.

CABLE GUY
Sometimes you don't have the time you
think you have. Just promise me you'll
never go bungee jumping in Mexico.

ROBIN
I promise.

CABLE GUY
(embarrassed that he spoke too much)
Anyway, I've got to go.

He quickly departs. We hold on Robin for a beat.

53	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The Cable Guy smiles, proud of himself.

53A	EXT. RENOVATION SITE - DUSK

Establishing shot of the building. We hear Steven's cellular phone ring.

53B	INT. RENOVATION SITE - DUSK - INTERCUT

Steven holds on a cellular phone as he walks down the long Gothic hallway of a half renovated 
school house. Around him construction workers go about their business.

STEVEN
Hello?

ROBIN (VO)
I love you.

STEVEN
Robin?

54	INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - INTERCUT

Robin is on the phone.

ROBIN
Yes.

STEVEN
(surprised)
I love you too.

ROBIN
That was so sweet of you.

STEVEN
(playing along)
Oh well

ROBIN
You didn't have to do that.

STEVEN
I wanted to.

ROBIN
Giving me free cable. Only you would do
that.

STEVEN
You got it? Great.

ROBIN
Yes, your friend came by.

STEVEN
My friend?

ROBIN
The Cable Guy. I liked him. He was kind
of goofy, but nice. Thank you so much
for doing that.

STEVEN
I'm glad you liked it. I've wanted to
do something nice for you, but I've been
trying to give you your space.

ROBIN
Well, I don't think we should make rules
anymore.

STEVE
Okay.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

ROBIN
Call me later if you're around?

STEVEN
Sure. I'll call you as son as I get
home. Bye.

Steven is elated. He can barely contain himself.

RICK (O.S.)
Steven, are you ready to go?

Steven turns and sees Rick wearing a "Soundgarden" T-shirt.

STEVEN
(pained)
The concert. Oh Jesus.

RICK
What?

STEVEN
Robin just called. I think we're getting
back together.

RICK
(pissed)
So you're blowing me off? I can't
believe this.

STEVEN
This is the first time she asked to get
back together.

RICK
You do this every time. You only call me
after a girl breaks your heart. "Oh Rick
can I stay on your couch? Let's talk all
night about how mean girls are." Then as
soon as a relationship starts again
it's bye-bye Rick. I don't know why I
fall for it anymore.

55	OMITTED

56	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is raining. Rick pulls up, and drops Steven off.

STEVEN
Can't you get someone else
to go?

(Revision Ends - Blue)

RICK
Maybe I'll take MY cable guy.

Steven gets out of the car. Rick drives off. Steven walks up the steps to his apartment. The Cable 
Guy appears from behind a corner.

CABLE GUY
Pretty smooth work. I set 'em up, you
knock 'em down.

STEVEN
What?

CABLE GUY
Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced
her up.

STEVEN
How do you know we're back together?

CABLE GUY
Free cable is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

STEVEN
I don't want you messing around with my
life. You've caused enough trouble as it
is.

CABLE GUY
I know. I felt bad about the other night,
so I wanted to make it up to you. So
what are you doing? Do you want to catch
a bite?

Steve looks the Cable Guy in the eye.

STEVEN
(sincerely yet curt)
Look, I appreciate you helping me out
with Robin. But you have to understand,
I'm going to have to work extra hard to
not screw this relationship up again.
You're a great guy, but I just don't have
any room in my life for a new friend. Do
you understand?

CABLE GUY
I appreciate your honesty. You're a real
straight shooter.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

STEVEN
So, you're okay?

CABLE GUY
Hey, I'm a big boy. It's no big deal.
Whatever.

STEVEN
All right well, take care.

CABLE GUY
Have a good one.

The Cable Guy walks away. Steven stands there feeling a little guilty about what he just did. 
MUSIC UP.

57	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ON THE TV - Conan O'Brien is doing a monologue joke about Sam Sweet.

Steven and Robin are kissing. Outside it is raining. There is occasional lightning and thunder. In 
the middle of kissing, lightning flashes. Steven looks up and sees a flash of the Cable Guy staring 
down at them, his faced pressed against the skylight. In the next flash he is gone. Was it real? 
Steven looks scared.

ROBIN
Are you alright?

STEVEN
I'm fine.

They go back to kissing.

57A	EXT. TELEPHONE POLE/INT. ROBIN'S OFFICE - DAY

The Cable Guy and Robin are speaking on the phone. As the conversation continues we slowly 
pull back and reveal that the Cable Guy is standing on the top of a telephone pole, dressed as a 
phone company employee. He speaks into a repairman's phone which is illegally hooked into the 
telephone pole.

CABLE GUY
Hey, it's Chip Douglas.

ROBIN
Chip Douglas?

CABLE GUY
Your cable guy.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

ROBIN
(surprised to hear from him)
Oh, hi. What's up?

CABLE GUY
I feel kind of weird calling you. It's
just I'm worried about Steven.

ROBIN
What is it?

CABLE GUY
Something isn't right. He hasn't been
himself lately. Have you noticed
anything?

ROBIN
No, things are actually going really
well.

CABLE GUY
Good.

ROBIN
Should I be worried?

CABLE GUY
Nope. I'm probably just being a nervous
nellie. Let's just keep our eyes open.

ROBIN
(nervous)
I will. Good-bye.

She hangs up, then dials Steven's number.

ROBIN
Steven Bartowsky please.

57B	INT. STEVEN'S SECRETARY'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

His secretary, JOAN, answers the phone.

JOAN
Sorry Robin. He's in a meeting.

58	INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A dozen of the top employees of the company Steven works for are having a meeting. Steven 
listens intently as a SALES MANAGER speaks to the group.

SALES MANAGER
The response to our initial offering has
been remarkable. A local investment
group has decided to buy the entire
complex and turn them into rentals. In
retrospect I must admit we made one big
mistake.

Everyone hangs on his every word.

SALES MANAGER
We should have asked for more money.

The entire room laughs. Mr. Daniels stands up.

MR. DANIELS
I just want to put this out there,
Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your
cajones, and mine, out on the table, and
you slam dunked it. Way to go.
(nervously jokes)
Now watch, they'll kick you upstairs
ahead of me. All right, in other
business

As Mr. Daniels speaks, Joan tries to get Steven's attention from a crack in the door.

JOAN
(quietly)
Pssst. Steven.

Steven turns and sees her. She waves for him to come to her. He waves her off.

JOAN
(more urgently-quietly)
I really need to speak with you.

Some people are beginning to notice this exchange.

STEVEN
(curtly)
It can wait.

Right then two POLICE OFFICERS storm into the room. Joan stands behind them looking 
concerned.

POLICE OFFICER
Is there a Steven Bartowsky here?

STEVEN
Uh I'm Steven Bartowsky. What's going
on?

POLICE OFFICER
You are under arrest.

MR. DANIELS
On what charge?

POLICE OFFICER
Receipt of stolen merchandise.

STEVEN
What? I never 

POLICE OFFICER
Please put our hands on the table.

Steven moves a sudden move toward the Police Officer. The Officer jabs him in the ribs with his 
club. Steven groans, then leans over in pain.

POLICE OFFICER
Please follow my instructions. Hands
on the table.

Steven puts his hands on the table. The Officer kicks his legs apart, then frisks him in front of 
everyone. It is pure humiliation.

POLICE OFFICER
Hands behind your back.

The other Officer cuffs him, then turns him around.

POLICE OFFICER #2
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you
in a court of law. You have the right to
an attorney. If you cannot afford an
attorney one will be provided for you.
Do you understand?

STEVE
This is all a mistake. I didn't accept
any stolen goods.

Just then it hits him. He hears the Cable Guy's voice in his head.

CABLE GUY (V.O.)
(with echo)
you're getting THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his
pants  cream in his pants.

He pushes him toward the door. Steven looks at everyone's horrified faces as he is taken away. He 
tries to break the tension with a joke.

STEVEN
Hey, relax. I'm the one who's going to
jail.

Nobody laughs. He exits.

59	EXT. OFFICE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER

Steven is walked to a police car, and put inside.

We slowly reveal a man across the street at an auto shop. He is looking under the hood of his car. 
Apparently it has broken down. The man turns and we see that it is the Cable Guy covertly 
watching Steven's humiliation. As the policeman pushes Steven into the car he looks at the Cable 
guy and touches his nose. The Cable Guy touches his nose.

60	INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

Steven is chained to a bench. He is speaking to his father EARL, a stout man of sixty, and his 
LAWYER.

EARL
I can't believe you did this.

STEVEN
I didn't do anything. My cable guy gave
me all that stuff as a present.

EARL
A stereo system and a big screen TV as a
present? You expect me to believe that?
You know you're killing your mother with
this.

STEVEN
I swear it's true.

EARL
Why would you accept such extravagant
gifts?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

STEVEN
I don't know. I shouldn't have.

EARL
What is really going on here Steven? Are
you on something?

STEVEN
I'm fine! I didn't do anything! Please
call my cable guy, his name is Ernie
Douglas.

LAWYER
Steven, the police looked into it, nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for 'The Cable
Company.'

EARL
You want to tell us the truth now

STEVEN
(falling apart)
That's got to be a mistake. Oh, this
is not happening.

EARL
Yes it is, and it's killing your mother.
Did you deliberately want to ruin our
fortieth anniversary party on Monday,
Steven?

STEVEN
Yeah, Dad, I did. It's all a big plan.
(to the lawyer)
When can you get me out of here?

LAWYER
Unfortunately it's too late to get a bail
hearing today. You're going to have to
spend the weekend in county lock up.

STEVEN
The entire weekend?

61	OMITTED

(Revision Ends - Blue)

62	INT. PRISON - LATER

Steven is now wearing prison blues. He holds a pillow and a set of sheets as he walks down the 
long corridor to his cell. Lining each side are cells filled with angry prisoners who throw things at 
Steven, and taunt him as he walks by. It is a nightmare.

PRISONER #1
New meat! Look at the pretty boy!

PRISONER #2
Nobody touches him, he's mine! You touch
him, you're dead!

PRISONER #3
Is baby scared? Don't cry baby!

They all laugh and scream at him until he reaches his cell. A guard opens the door. Steven enters 
his cell. He turns and inside is an angry looking prisoner. The door is locked behind him.

ANGRY PRISONER
Ooh, looks like I won the lottery.

63	OMITTED

64	INT. VISITORS ROOM - MORNING

A guard walks Steven in. His lawyer sits on the other side of the glass with his back to Steven. 
Steven sits down and picks up the phone, excited to hear any news.

STEVEN
What did you hear? What did you hear?

The man turns around. It is not Steven's lawyer, it is the
Cable Guy dressed in an expensive suit.

CABLE GUY
Hello Steven. I came as soon as I heard.

Steven's head sinks.

STEVEN
Who are you?! What's your real name?!

CABLE GUY
So many questions.

STEVEN
Why are you doing this to me?

CABLE GUY
I didn't do this to you, you did this to
you. You need to learn who your friends
are.

STEVEN
You set me up.

CABLE GUY
I taught you a lesson. I can be your best
friend, or your worst enemy. I hope
you'll choose the latter I mean, the
former. You know what I mean.

STEVEN
I'll never be your friend. You need help.

The Cable Guy absorbs the blow, then goes on the offensive.

CABLE GUY
Right now I think you're the one who
needs help. I'm here to give you comfort.

The Cable Guy huts his hand up to the glass.

CABLE GUY
Come on, touch it.

Steven just stares at him.

CABLE GUY
Come on. You need human contact. Touch
it.

STEVEN
I will not touch it.

The Cable Guy stands up, and begins unbuttoning his shirt.

STEVEN
What are you doing? Stop it.

Steven looks around frantically.

CABLE GUY
I know how you're feeling right now.

The Cable Guy pushes his naked breast against the glass. Other prisoners are beginning to stare.

STEVEN
(smacking the glass)
Stop it! Stop it!

CABLE GUY
I'm here for you.

STEVEN
(smacks the glass three times)
Get off there! Are you trying to get me
killed?

The Cable Guy begins to laugh.

CABLE GUY
(as he buttons his shirt)
I was just messing with your mind. That
was from 'Midnight Express.' Awesome
film. Oliver Stone won the Academy Award
for the screenplay.

STEVEN
Guard! Guard!

CABLE GUY
Don't you worry about Robin, I'll make
sure she's well taken care of.

STEVEN
You go near her, I'll kill you.

Steven lunges at the glass. Steven's guard pulls Steven out of the room toward the exit.

STEVEN
Hey, this is the guy who framed me!

The Cable Guy walks to his door. He turns to the guard at the door.

CABLE GUY
(warmly)
Louis, how'd you like that Tyson fight on
Pay Per View? I told you it's more fun
when it's Free Per View.

They both laugh. The door closes behind them.

65	EXT. OUTDOOR CAFÉ - DAY

The Cable Guy is sitting at a table wearing a Walkman. People look at him funny as he speaks out 
loud to his lisp tape.

(Revision 11/13/95 - Blue)

CABLE GUY
(over-pronouncing)
Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon.
Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious.
Suspicious. Sensational. Sensational.

Robin is brought over to the table by a hostess. The Cable Guy takes off his Walkman, and stands 
up to be polite. He sits down in perfect synch with her.

ROBIN
Hello.

CABLE GUY
Hello. I'm sorry we have to meet under
these circumstances.

ROBIN
Me too. Believe me.

CABLE GUY
I know we don't know each other very
well, but we do have one thing in common, 
our concern for Steven.

ROBIN
Well, you were right. Something's
happening with him and he won't even
acknowledge it.

CABLE GUY
If he refuses to admit he has a problem,
we may have to let him hit bottom. He's
gonna need some tough love.

ROBIN
(tentatively)
You know his lawyer said that nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for the Cable
Company.

CABLE GUY
(chuckles)
Did he do a name search? 'Cause I work
under a pseudonym so the customers won't
harass me at home. Kind of like a
stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry
Tate.

ROBIN
And he's saying he received all the
stereo equipment from you.

CABLE GUY
(I know, and I'm not mad. He's been
cornered, so he's telling some wives
tales. He doesn't mean to hurt me.

ROBIN
I just feel like I triggered this with
him. It's not that I don't want to get
married, it's just I felt like he wanted
to get married just to get married. I
don't deal well with pressure.

CABLE GUY
Hey, welcome to the human race. We're
not perfect. We all think we have to
look like a 'Baywatch' babe and be as
witty as 'Seinfeld.' Give yourself a
break.

ROBIN
God I could go for turkey and mashed
potatoes now.

CABLE GUY
Comfort food. Bring it on.

ROBIN
Exactly.

She laughs.

CABLE GUY
You've got a great laugh. Can I make a
small request? I'd like to hear it a little
more often.

She blushes.

66	INT. PRISON ADMINISTRATION - NEXT DAY

ON THE TV - Hard Copy's BARRY NOLAN, sits behind his desk giving a news update.

BARRY NOLAN
The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown into
chaos as a result of a videotape made a
month after the killing. In this "Hard
Copy" exclusive an apparently intoxicated
Sam Sweet puts on a macabre show for his
friends at a party. The judge has not
decided whether this tape is admissible
as evidence.

We see a videotape of Sam Sweet at a party. The date and time are seen in the corner. Sam stands 
next to the corner of a wall which is completely covered with a mirror. Sam gestures with a beer 
bottle as he looks at his reflection in the mirror.

SAM SWEET
(to camera)
Hey everyone. Look it's me and
(gestures to his reflection)
my brother Stan.
(waves at reflection)
Hi Stan. It's so nice to see you. How
are you feeling?
(to camera)
Look, he's alive.

Sam punches the mirror, shattering it.

SAM SWEET
(angry)
Now he's dead.

Realizing he's revealed too much, he forces a smile.

SAM SWEET
What? I'm just goofing around.

We pull back and reveal a group of police officers watching this on television.

We pan over to Steven's father EARL paying bail.

STEVEN
I'm sorry dad.

EARL
I don't want to hear it. Do you know the
pain you out your mother through? You're
lucky she didn't die of a heart attack.

STEVEN
I didn't do anything.

EARL
Just like you said you didn't steal that
'X-Men' comic book when you were eight.
Then I found it in your underwear drawer.

STEVEN
Will you ever stop mentioning that?

EARL
This cost me a lot of money. You jump
bail, and I swear I'll hire a bounty
hunter to hunt you down.

67	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Steven walks into his apartment, exhausted from his jail experience. He walks into the living room 
and sees several new frames on the wall. They are four foot blow ups of Polaroid photographs of 
Steven with his arm around the Cable Guy at the karaoke jam. The photos have been tinted in a 
stylish fashion.

Steven angrily runs to the wall and takes them down.

68	OMITTED

69	EXT. STEVEN'S PARENTS' HOME - NIGHT

Steven and Robin are walking up the stairs to the front door. They are dressed up for his parents' 
anniversary party.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

ROBIN
Are you sure you're okay?

STEVEN
I'm fine.

ROBIN
You're not fine. When you say you're
fine, I know you're not fine.

STEVEN
I just want to get this over with so I
can go home and get some rest.

ROBIN
I wanted you to know I invited your
friend. He was concerned about you.

STEVEN
Great. I feel. Bad. I've been kind of
blowing Rick off lately.

He rings the doorbell.

ROBIN
Not Rick.

The door opens. Standing there, dressed to kill, is the Cable Guy.

CABLE GUY
You can only come in if you came to rage.

Steven is shocked. Robin walks in. When Steven walks in, the Cable Guy stops him.

CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
Is this guy cool?
(to Steven)
I'm just joshing. Come on in.

They walk inside.

70	INT. STEVEN'S FATHER'S HOME

Steven turns to Robin.

STEVEN
(enraged)
What is he doing here?

ROBIN
I invited him.

STEVEN
When did you invite him?

ROBIN
At lunch the other day.

STEVEN
At lunch? You had lunch with him?

The Cable Guy walks over.

ROBIN
Hello. You look great.

She gives him a peck on the cheek. Steven winces.

CABLE GUY
And you are a vision. Hello Steven.
You're looking rested.

STEVEN
Come here.

He pulls the Cable Guy aside.

CABLE GUY
Steven, what's with you tonight? I'm
getting some really weird energy from
you.

STEVEN
Maybe it's because I just got out of
prison, where you sent me. I should just
drag you to the police right now.

CABLE GUY
You can if you like, but I'd hate to have
to show Robin this.

He takes out a Polaroid of Steven kissing the hooker.

STEVEN
You son of a bitch.

The Cable Gut quickly puts it away.

CABLE GUY
Come on Steven, let's just have a good
time tonight.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

Robin, Earl and Steven's mother walk over.

EARL
Steven, your mother and I had a long talk
with your friend Larry here when he came
over to screw in the cable.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
(to the Cable Guy)
Thank you again for that.

EARL
(beat)
We owe you an apology. I didn't realize
the seriousness of your problems. You're
obviously going through some kind of
personal hell and I need to be more
understanding. We didn't get involved
with things like that when I was your
age.

Steven cannot figure out what kind of lie the Cable Guy has told them.

EARL
I know we haven't been there for you
lately but we're going to see you through
this, 'cause we are a family. I love
you.

He gives him a big hug. Steven grimaces.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
You've got a good friend here.

They walk into the next room where the entire family is gathered for pre-dinner cocktails.

Steven's brother PETE walks over to Steven. He carries a baby in a pouch.

PETE
(winks)
Hey buddy, we're with you. Keep your
chin up.

71	INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

As the Cable Guy charms Steven's family we pan across all of the guests laughing, and enjoying 
dinner.

CABLE GUY
So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and
he's chasing me, swinging like a mad
man. I'm yelling at him,
'hey, it's just a show!'

(Revision Ends - Blue)

STEVEN'S SISTER
He always takes things too seriously.

CABLE GUY
Tell me something I don't know. This guy
almost took my head off.

Everybody laughs.

The camera moves to Steven. He stares at the Cable Guy, his eyes filled with rage.

STEVEN'S P.O.V.

The Cable Guy is talking and eating in SLOW-MOTION.

ON STEVEN - watching him. He is in normal motion.

ON THE CABLE GUY - eating in SLOW-MOTION

ON STEVEN - getting very irritated.

STEVEN
What are you doing?

ON THE CABLE GUY

As he talks we realize he has not been in slow motion, he's just been pretending he's in slow 
motion.

CABLE GUY
It's from "Goodfellas." Remember the
intro scene at the bar. I'm Johnny Two
Times.

He moves in slow motion some more. Everyone laughs.

TONY, Steven's six year old nephew, runs to the Cable Guy with a toy gun.

TONY/CABLE GUY
Pow, pow, pow. You're under arrest.

Everyone laughs. The Cable Guy starts running around the table. Tony makes chase, laughing all 
the way.

CABLE GUY
You'll never catch me copper.

The Cable Guy stops, grabs a piece of asparagus and puts it between his lip and nose, and pretends 
it's a moustache.

CABLE GUY
I'm gonna wear a disguise.

Steven looks at the Cable Guy and remembers something.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees the Cable Guy. The artist's rendering of the man who beat up Robin's 
date appears in front of the Cable Guy's face. Steven realizes that they are the same person.

Steven gets a frightened look on his face.

The kid points his gun at the Cable Guy and yells "pow." The Cable Guy drops to the floor like 
he's been shot.

CABLE GUY
Oh, you got me.

The Cable Guy plays dead. The kid walks over to him. When he gets close, the Cable Guy lunges 
to grab him.

CABLE GUY
(devil voice)
Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and lives!

The kid screams with laughter and runs away. The Cable Guy chases him around the table and out 
of the room. Steven instantly fears for Tony's safety. He follows them.

72-75	OMITTED

75A	INT. LIBRARY - A MOMENT LATER

Steven walks around looking for Tony. Suddenly from behind a couch Tony and the Cable Guy 
pop out.

TONY/CABLE GUY
Booo!

Steven flies back, scared out of his wits. Tony and the Cable Guy start laughing hysterically. They 
have a grand 'ol time enjoying their little prank.

CABLE GUY
Oh man, you should have seen your face.
It was classic.

STEVEN
Very funny. Tony, go to your mother!

Tony immediately starts crying. He leaves.

CABLE GUY
Look what you've done.

STEVEN
I know you beat up Robin's date.

The Cable Guy's laughter stops on a dime.

CABLE GUY
I guess I did what you didn't have the
guts to do.

STEVEN
You stay away from Robin.

CABLE GUY
(disturbed)
Don't mess with me. I'm feeling like a
part of the family, and I like it. You
should try it sometime.

Steven's mother enters.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
(looks at them)
My, you two look like brothers. Come on
back, we're all having coffee in the
living room.

Cable Guy quickly starts walking back to the dining room.

CABLE GUY
(happily)
Are you guys trying to fatten me up?
'Cause if you are, you're doing a damn
good job of it.

He laughs, and exits. Steven slowly follows.

76-78 OMITTED

79	INT. LIVING AREA - LATER

Everyone is sitting around having coffee. The Cable Guy is writing words on torn up pieces of 
paper.

CABLE GUY
You guys have never played "Porno
Password?"

EARL
No, but I like the sound of it.

CABLE GUY
It's the adult version of the popular
television game show. Robin you're on my
team. Steven, you're with mom.
(to everyone else)
You're the audience.

The Cable Guy sits next to Robin. Steven and his mother sit across from them.

The Cable Guy looks at the word, then shows it to the family so none of the contestants can see it. 
He whispers it in Steven's ear.

CABLE GUY
(whispers)
The password is vagina.

Steven winces.

STEVEN
I really don't want to play this game.
(looks to his mother)
Woman. Woman.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
Uh man?

STEVEN
No.

CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis.

Robin concentrates hard, but she can't figure it out.

CABLE GUY
Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis.

ROBIN
Vagina?

CABLE GUY
(pumps his fist)
Yes!

He high fives Robin. Everyone laughs.

EARL
(blurts out)
I thought it was going to be schlong!
(covers his mouth - embarrassed)
Whoops.

Everyone laughs. They are all having a great time, except Steven. The Cable Guy looks at the next 
word, shows it to the family privately, then whipsers to Steven.

CABLE GUY
The password is nipple.

STEVEN
Can I pass?

EARL
Come on Steven, don't be a stick in the
mud.

STEVEN
Breast. Breast.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
Tit?

Everyone laughs. Steven's face is red.

CABLE GUY
Hard
(gestures like there is another word after it)
Hard

ROBIN
Erection?

Everyone laughs. Steven looks like he might kill the Cable Guy.

STEVEN
Center. Center.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
Nipple?

Everyone cheers.

STEVEN'S MOTHER
I can't believe I got it. I was going to
say areola.

Everyone laughs except Steven, who is mortified.

CABLE GUY
I wish you did, 'cause we'd be ahead.

The Cable Guy shows the word to everyone, then whispers in Steven's ear.

CABLE GUY
The password is I'm not sure how to
pronounce this, it's either clitoris, or
clit-oris.

STEVEN
(snaps)
I can't say that to my mother!

EARL
Hey, she's a grown woman. She can handle
it.

ROBIN
Come on Steven. We're just having fun.

STEVEN
No, I've had enough. I can't do this.
This guy is ruining my life, I won't sit
here and play X-rated party games with
him.

EARL
Steven, I really think you're over-
reacting.

STEVEN
I am not over-reacting. You're all being
fooled by this guy! He's a felon for
Christ sake!
(to the Cable Guy)
I hate you! Get out of my life!

CABLE GUY
I'm sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance,
I will leave. I would never stay where I
am not wanted.

ROBIN
(to the Cable Guy)
You're not a nuisance. Please don't go.
(to Steven)
Steven, you're being an asshole.

EARL
Yeah, Steven it seems like you're the one
with the problem.

STEVEN
What? You have no idea what this guy is
really like.

CABLE GUY
I'll just go.

STEVEN
See what I mean!

CABLE GUY
Steven, what's with you tonight?
(gets close to Steven and whispers)
Robin showed me that birthmark on her
left shoulder. It's very sexy.

Steven punches the Cable Guy in the facem sending him to the floor. All of the women, including 
Robin run to help him.

ROBIN
(to Steven)
I can't believe you.

The Cable Guy gets up.

CABLE GUY
I'm fine. Thank you for a delightful
evening.
(to Steven)
I forgive you.

He exits. Everyone looks at Steven like he is the devil.

STEVEN
You don't understand.

Everyone walks away from Steven. The party is over.

80	EXT. DRIVEWAY - LATER

Robin is venting her anger at Steven as they walk to the car.

ROBIN
I just think you were completely out of
line. I don't know what's happening to
you these days.

Steven gets fed up.

STEVEN
Robin, this guy is a sociopath. He
leaves messages on my machine night and
day. He shows up wherever I go. He
won't leave me alone.

ROBIN
Sounds familiar.

STEVEN
You know he was the one who beat up your
date at that restaurant. That's right.
And he gave you the free cable. It wasn't
me.

ROBIN
But you took the credit for it?

STEVEN
That's what he wanted. He was
manipulating me. It feels so good to be
honest about this. We're finally
communicating. I've been wanting to tell
you for so long, but he's been
blackmailing me.

ROBIN
Blackmailing you? How?

STEVEN
With a photograph.

ROBIN
Of what?

STEVEN
Me with a... prostitute.

ROBIN
What?!

STEVEN
He set it up. He invited this woman to
my party and didn't tell me she was a
prostitute. I'm so glad we can talk
about this.

ROBIN
When did you have a party?

STEVEN
When we weren't communicating. I invited
you. You were out on a date.

ROBIN
And you were with a prostitute.

STEVEN
She seduced me. That's what they do.
They're professionals. And I didn't even
know she was a prostitute.

ROBIN
So that makes it better?

STEVEN
That's not the point. The point is this
guy has been setting me up. He's
responsible.

ROBIN
He didn't have sex with a whore. You
did.

STEVEN
Robin you don't --

ROBIN
I don't want to hear it. Breaking up was
the best thing we ever did. You have
some serious problems, and it's not my
responsibility to help you. I am only
responsible for my own happiness.

STEVEN
Where did that come from?

ROBIN
It was Jerry Springer's "final thought."

She exits.

80A	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

Rick is running to an editing bay. Steven follows him.

STEVEN
I'm sorry I've been blowing you off.

RICK
You bet your ass you've been blowing me
off.

STEVEN
It's just, this guy is really doing a
number on me.

RICK
I told you not to hang out with him.

STEVEN
You're the one who told me to offer him
money so I could get free cable.

RICK
You didn't tell me he was a psychopath.
(beat)
I'll see if I can get my friend in
research to track him down. What's his
name again?

STEVEN
Ernie Douglas.

RICK
Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does
that sound so familiar?

81	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY

Steven's secretary Joan is watching a news report about the Sam Sweet trial on a mini television.

On the TV - a Female Prosecutor gestures with a shotgun as she questions a policeman.

Joan changes channels. The image changes to LARRY KING interviewing ALAN 
DERSHOWITZ regarding "the abuse excuse."

BACK TO SCENE

Steven walks over to Joan.

STEVEN
(to his secretary)
Did anyone notice I'm late?

JOAN
What are you talking about, you've been
here for an hour.

STEVEN
Thank you.

Steven walks to his office.

81A	INT. STEVEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Steven walks behind his desk. He notices something which disturbs him. His computer is on. He 
clicks a button and a message comes on the screen.

ON THE SCREEN - "GOOD MORNING STEVEN. HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY. HERE'S 
AN EXTRA SPECIAL SURPRISE."

Then an image comes on the screen. It is black and white surveillance video, digitized to the 
computer format. The video is of Robin and Steven talking. It is the conversation they had before 
they watched "Sleepless in Seattle."

STEVEN
Work's good.

ROBIN
How's Hal?

STEVEN
Don't get me started. That guy has no
vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo.
He's just worthless.

ROBIN
It's just great that you're getting to do
it. It's a real step up.

STEVEN
I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I
could really get some stuff done.

The sccene starts again. It is on a loop. Steven is aghast. He looks up and sees the scene is playing 
on every computer in the office. He gets a panicked look on his face. Is Hal seeing this? He runs 
out of his office to prevent Hal from viewing this.

81B	OFFICE BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs to the edge of the stairs and looks down.

STEVEN'S P.O.V. - He sees Hal downstairs, walking into his office.

BACK TO STEVEN - He runs down the stairs towards Hal's office as fast as he can.

81C	INT. HAL'S OFFICE

Steven walks in. Hal is sitting behind his desk staring angrily at the computer. He looks up and 
sees Steven.

HAL
Don't worry. I didn't see it --- 'cause I
have no vision.

Steven knows what's coming.

82C	INT. PARKING GARAGE - LATER

Steven walks to his car carrying a box filled with his belongings. He has been fired. Suddenly a car 
alarm beeps. It's headlights flash. Then another, and another. Soon he is surrounded by screaming 
car alarms, and flashing headlights. He looks around in fear.

STEVEN
Chip! Chip, this isn't funny! Where are
you?!!!

Suddenly they all stop simultaneously, and then the only sound is a miniacle laugh echoing through 
the garage.

Steven runs to his car, and gets in. He drives up the ramp in a panic. From out of nowhere the 
Cable Guy steps into the beam of his headlights. He cannot stop in time. The Cable Guy is thrown 
into the air, then lands on the back of the roof of the car. Before he falls off he grabs on to the bar 
of the luggage rack.

Steven looks through his rear view window and sees the Cable Guy staring at him.

As Steven continues to drive the Cable Guy climbs on to the roof of the car, then jumps on the 
hood, and stares at Steven through the windshield. Steven swerves around, almost losing control 
of the car.

STEVEN
Leave me alone! I have no job, no
girlfriend, no family anymore! It's
over! You won!

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

CABLE GUY
(menacingly)
Oh no. It's not over. It's just gettin'
started.

He turns a corner very sharply throwing the Cable Guy off his car. The Cable Guy falls to the 
ground, rolling many times, then leaps to his feet using the momentum of the roll, and runs off, 
scampering like a supernatural bug.

So we're nowhere. Ernie Douglas? Ernie
Douglas?

She begins tapping her foot nervously.

RICK
Could you stop that?

RESEARCHER
Don't snap at me. I'm doing this as a
favor.

He continues staring at her two-tone wing tipped style shoe.

RICK
(has an epiphany)
Wait, could you start that again? Start
tapping your foot again.

She begins tapping. Rick begins humming the theme to "My Three Sons." She joins him. They sing 
louder and louder. They've broken the code.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

96	INT. STEVEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGS. Steven runs in the front door, and picks up the phone.

STEVEN
Hello.

RICK (VO)
Bingo. "My Three Sons."

STEVEN
Chip and Ernie Douglas.

97	INT. NEWSROOM - CONTINUOUS - INTERCUT

Rick sits at his desk. The researcher is at his side.

RICK
I've got a list of every cable installer
fired in the last four years. Every one
of these guys has the same physical
description as our friend.
(reads from the list)
Murray Slaughter, Brendan Walsh, Sam
Malone, Alex Reiger. There was even a
guy who liked to be called 'the big
Ragu.'

97AA	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven walks in and looks for the Cable Guy's hidden camera as he speaks on the phone.

STEVEN
Carmine from "Laverne and Shirley."

RICK
That's so sad that you know that.
Anyway, the cable company in town fired a
guy six months ago named Darren Stevens.
He stole the truck and disappeared.
That's our guy.

Steven finds a small camera in one of the television speakers. He rips it out.

STEVEN
So he doesn't even work for the Cable
Company?

97A	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Quick cuts of Steven bolting doors, and locking windows.

RICK (VO)
He was fired for beating up a customer
who yelled at him for being late. A
company in Denver thinks they might have
a lead on who he really is.
If I were you I'd lock down tonight.
I'll call you when I get some more info.

98	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Steven is watching television. He struggles to stay awake.

ON THE TV - Court TV. The prosecutor in the Sam Sweet trial is speaking.

PROSECUTOR (ON TV)
Don't let your memories of these cute
twins distract you from the fact that
this funny star of a situation comedy
killed his own brother in cold blood,
then called the police and said he was
killed by an Asian gang. There was no
laugh-track on that night.

The prosecutor's words turn into gibberish as Steven's eyes go heavy and he falls asleep.

99	ON STEVEN - HE IS ASLEEP	HE SLOWLY WAKES UP.

The gibberish turns into clearly spoken words, only this time the voice sounds more familiar.

ON THE TV - We see the Sam Sweet trial. A prosecutor makes a passionate final summation. We 
reveal that it is the Cable Guy.

CABLE GUY
This man killed his own brother. Some
people don't even have a brother...

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy's face. He looks to camera.

CABLE GUY
...do they Steven? Are you listening to
me? Don't shut it off. Don't shut it --

ON STEVEN - He shuts off the TV, and walks out of the room.

100	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The entire apartment appears much larger. Steven walks down the hallway. He looks into the 
living room and sees Rick.

RICK
Why do you keep icing me man?

100A	INT. ELONGATED BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

He opens up a door and sees an elongated version of his bathroom. The shower is steaming. The 
two eight year old Sweet twins stand in front of it looking very spooky. He quickly closes the 
door.

100B	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He continues down the hallway and opens the door to the dining room, but when he opens it he 
sees Robin's bedroom.

100C	INT. ROIN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robin is in bed. A man wearing a cable installer's uniform is smothering her with a pillow. The 
man turns -- it is Steven. He quickly closes the door.

100D	INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He hears someone pounding on the front door. He opens the door. Nobody is there. Then the 
Cable Guy pops into frame holding a cut cord.

CABLE GUY
You owe me!

Steven slams the door. Then looks through the peep hole.

101	P.O.V. THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE

The Cable Guy begins to run full speed at the door. As he does he gets bigger and bigger, and 
more distorted as he come closer to the peephole. BANG! He hits the door. Then disappears from 
frame. A moment later he stumbles back into frame, then walks to the far end of the hall, and runs 
again to the door even faster. BANG! He staggers back into position again. He runs toward the 
door.

102	INT. STEVEN'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs away from the front door. The door smashes open, and the Cable Guy runs after him.

Steven runs away down the hallway. The hallway appears to be a mile long. He tries to run fast 
but appears to move in almost slow motion. Every time he looks over his shoulder he sees the 
Cable Guy running at an alarmingly fast rate of speed toward him, grunting like a wolf. He looks 
back another time and the Cable Guy is gone.

He keeps running, and the hallway starts getting smaller and smaller, till he can barely fit through. 
He becomes trapped at the end of the hall. Arms come out of the window behind him and grab 
him. Fifty Cable Guy faces pop out of the wall on both sides.

CABLE GUY
I just want to hang out. No big deal.

Steven breaks free of the hands and runs into his living room.

103	OMITTED

104	INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs in. The television is on. He sits on the edge of the couch not sure what to do.

He puts his head down. When he looks up, he sees the Cable Guy's face on the television set. The 
Cable Guy's face stretches out from the television, getting larger and larger.

CABLE GUY
Steven, you're just like me. We're cut
from the same cloth. We're one and the
same!

Then it opens its mouth, and swallows Steven pulling him into the television.

105	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Steven wakes up in a cold sweat.

STEVEN
(panting)
Oh my god. She's right. I am a
smotherer. I'm just like him.

The phone rings.

STEVEN
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)
It didn't have to come to this Steven.
We could have been blood brothers.

STEVEN
Rick told me you were fired from The
Cable Company. You're not even a real
cable guy.

106	INT. SOMEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

Close up of the Cable Guy's face.

CABLE GUY
Do you feel good now that you've hurt me?
Well now I'm going to have to hurt you.
I'm going to take away what you hold
dearest in the world.

STEVEN (VO)
I swear to God, if you touch --

CABLE GUY
Could you hold on a second, I've got call
waiting. It'll just be a sec.

He clicks over. Steven just sits there, waiting. Waiting some more. Then the Cable Guy clicks 
back.

CABLE GUY
Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh yeah.
You're going to feel my wrath.

107	INT. STEVEN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

STEVEN
(pleading)
Don't do this. There must be some way
for us to work this out.

108	INT. SOMEWHERE - CONTINUOUS

CABLE GUY
I wish there was.
(losing it)
Oh Steven, I'm just so tired. So very
tired.

STEVEN
Let's talk in person. Where are you?

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

CABLE GUY
I'm close. So very close.

The camera rotates and reveals that the Cable Guy is actually lying down. Then the camera rises 
up and reveals that the Cable Guy is lying in the floorboards right underneath Steven. A single 
beam of light shines across his face. As he speaks a large daddy long legs spider crawls across his 
face. He never acknowledges it.

CABLE GUY
You know, I don't think you're right for
Robin. She needs someone who can be
sensitive to her needs. Someone who
understands her soul.

STEVEN
You stay away from her.

CABLE GUY
Aren't we the control freak. Looks like
you're starting to sweat.

STEVEN
I got the camera. You can't see me.

Steven begins to pick his face.

CABLE GUY
Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your
face?

Steven throws the phone. When it lands we see the speaker phone light is on. He begins looking 
for the camera. He smashes his TV.

JUMP CUTS - Steven tearing through everything in his apartment.

CABLE GUY
You're getting closer.

Steven overturns a CD rack.

CABLE GUY
Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know
sometimes the answer is right under your
nose.

Steven lloks at the floorboards, then runs out of the room, and returns a moment later with an ax. 
He starts chopping at the floorboards, tearing the out.

He looks down into the hole, he sees nothing. Then a hand grabs him by the shirt and pulls his face 
into the space in the floor. The Cable Guy's face appears in front of him, screaming like a mad 
man. He licks Steven's face quickly, then disappears back into the hole. Steven falls back. He hears 
the Cable Guy scuttle away.

Steven sticks his head back down into the hole only to see the dust in the floorboards swirl in the 
aftermath of the Cable Guy's exit. He hears the Cable Guy crawling through the walls above him, 
then through the side walls, and away into the distance. When it clears he discovers a small 
makeshift observation room has been set up in the crawlspace.

There are a few photos pasted to the floorboards. One shows the Cable Guy as a child standing 
next to his mother. Steven's picture has been pasted into those photos making him look like the 
Cable Guy's brother. The only other photo is of Jerry Springer. Steven sees a small television 
monitor and a set of headphones from which the Cable Guy has been watching him. He looks at a 
cellular phone. Every speed dial on the back of the phone says "Steven" next to it.

Steven gets up, and runs out of his front door.

108A	EXT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

It is raining lightly outside. Steven is in his car. He pulls away quickly.

109	INT. RICK'S NEWSROOM - NIGHT

Rick sits at his desk. The PHONE RINGS.

RICK
Hello.

109AA	INT. MOVING VEHICLE - NIGHT

Super Close Up - What the audience will think is Steven's mouth (actually the Cable Guy) 
speaking on a cellular phone.

STEVEN
Hey Rick. I need to meet with you right
away. I've got some information about
this crazy cable guy.

RICK
Me too. I've got the whole story.

STEVEN
That's great. Let's meet at the old
school at nine-thirty.

RICK
Why all the way out there?

STEVEN
I think he's been following me. Don't be
late, buddy.

109AB	EXT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Steven's car screeches to a stop. He runs up to Robin's door and starts knocking. Her FEMALE 
NEIGHBOOR opens her door.

STEVEN
Be home! Be home!

FEMALE NEIGHBOOR
Go away! I remember you. You're her
obsessive boyfriend. She said you might
come here. I'm calling the police.

She closers her door. He runs off.

109A	EXT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - NIGHT

Rick drives up, then walks into the building.

110	INT. HALF RENOVATED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

Rick walks through the school looking for Steven.

RICK
Steven? Steven?

In the distance he sees Steven standing in the shadows.

STEVEN
Hey Rick. I'm really excited to hear
what you found out about this nut.

RICK
I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply
troubled. Only child. His mother was
arrested for prostitution, and phone
solicitation. Apparently she was some
phone sex pioneer.

STEVEN
No way.

RICK
And get this, he was discharged from the
Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so
he sent a weapons silo to Defcon Two
using a Radio Shack computer. And that's
not the half of it.

As Rick gets closer Steven steps forward out of the shadows, and we reveal that it is not Steven, 
but the Cable Guy, dressed like Steven, doing a perfect impression (actually the real voice of 
Steven looped into the Cable Guy's mouth - with a very slight lisp).

CABLE GUY
Really? Tell me more.

Rick's face turns white. He stumbles backwards, trying to get away.

CABLE GUY
I'm very interested in learning
everything I can about that wacked out
cable installer.

He turns and runs. He is fifteen feet away from the Cable Guy.

The camera pushes in on the Cable Guy. He pulls out a staple gun, and fires. We hear but do not 
see Rick yelp, and fall.

CABLE GUY
It sounds like he might hurt somebody.

110A	INT. STEVEN'S CAR - NIGHT

Steven is driving in his car. His cellular phone rings. He picks it up.

STEVEN
(panicked)
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)
(talks like a game show host)
Nosey friends for two hundred. This
supposed pal of Steven's is currently
residing in the intensive care unit of
Good Samaritan Hospital.

STEVEN
Rick.

CABLE GUY (VO)
I'm sorry, you didn't answer in the form
of a question.

He hangs up.

111	OMITTED

111A	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Steven's car pulls up. He gets out, and runs toward the hospital.

112	INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Steven flies through the swinging doors, and runs through the hallway of the hospital. He walks up 
to a DOCTOR.

STEVEN
(rapid fire)
Rick Legatos. He's a friend of mine.
Where is he?

DOCTOR
Room 205.

STEVEN
Can I see him?

DOCTOR
Yes. But he can't speak. He's in shock.

113	INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Steven enters the room. The camera pulls back to reveal Rick laying in full traction, face down, his 
rear end heavily bandaged. He is unconscious.

Steven tentatively walks over to Rick's rear end. He pulls back a small portion of the bandage and 
sees that his butt is covered with staples. The staples form the shape of a television with an 
antenna. Inside the TV is the word "RING."

STEVE
(perplexed)
Ring?

The phone rings. Steven jumps, then picks up the phone.

STEVEN
Hello.

CABLE GUY (VO)
Poor Rick. Seems he had a little
accident with the business end of a
staple gun.

(Revision Ends - Blue)

STEVEN
You're not going to get away with this.

CABLE GUY
The question is, are you going to get
away with it? Apparently there was an
anonymous tip placed to the police
leading them to a staple gun at the crime
scene with your fingerprints all over it.

ROBIN
(VO)
All right, I'm ready.

114-6	OMITTED (NOW A PART OF SCENE 106)

116A	INT. ROBIN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - INTERCUT

We reveal that the Cable Guy is at Robin's apartment. They are getting ready to go out.

CABLE GUY
(non psychotic voice)
Be right there.

STEVEN
Was that Robin?

CABLE GUY
(psychotic again)
I've got to go. We're going to take a
romantic stroll on the information
superhighway.

Steven drops the phone, and runs out of the room.

116B	INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Steven runs down the hall to the elevator. Before he reaches it the doors open, and the two 
policemen who arrested him at work walk out. Steven quickly turns left, but the policemen see 
him, and make chase.

OFFICER
Hey, hold it!

116C	EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Steven runs out of the hospital. The two policemen run after him, about twenty feet behind. 
Steven jumps in his car, and takes off. The police follow in their car.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

116D	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Steven's car turns a corner, and flies down a busy boulevard. A second later the police cars follow 
with sirens blaring.

116E	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin are at the dish. He gives her the same tour he gave Steven earlier in the 
film.

CABLE GUY
...it all started in Lansford,
Pennsylvania where Panther Valley
Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable
television system.

116F	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The chase continues.

116G	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin are now standing on the edge of the dish.

CABLE GUY
The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television,
phone, and computer. You'll be able to
visit the Louvre on one channel, and
watch female mud wrestling on another.
You can do your shopping at home, or play
a game of Mortal Kombat with a friend in
Vietnam.

117	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

The chase continues.

Steven slams on the gas, until he is driving one-hundred miles-per-hour. He weaves in and out of 
traffic, running stop lights, and avoiding obstacles. The police cars disappear behind him. On a 
dime, Steven turns left onto a residential street and shuts off his lights. A moment later all of the 
police cars pass by. Steven pulls out and heads the other way.

117A	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - NIGHT

ROBIN
This is really fascinating, but I really
think we ought to go now.

CABLE GUY
I knew you'd appreciate it. I took
Steven here once, and he didn't give a
rats ass about my interests.

ROBIN
I'm worried about Steven.

CABLE GUY
Maybe Steven should be worried about you.
(beat)
So, where was I?

118	OMITTED (NOW PART OF SCENE 109AB)

119	OMITTED

120	OMITTED

121	OMITTED

122	EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Steven drives his car up the muddy dirt road. It gets stuck in the mud. He gets out of the car, and 
begins walking to the satellite dish which is surrounded by a chain link fence. He hears the sounds 
of horse hooves coming closer, and closer. The  he sees a headless man on a horse ride straight 
toward the fence. The horse has the coat of arms from Medieval Times. When he reaches it he 
smashes off the chain with a sword, then rides through. The horse rears back on its hind legs.

The horse runs full speed directly at Steven. At the last possible moment the horse jumps over 
Steven. When the horse stops, the Cable Guy pops his head through the top of his coat.

CABLE GUY
(chuckles)
Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed
it all last month.

The Cable Guy rides toward him again.

CABLE GUY
(like the Vegas announcer)
Let's get ready to ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!

(Revision Ends - Blue)

This time when he gets near Steven, he leaps off the horse, onto him. They both slam into a puddle 
of mud. The Cable Guy punches him in the stomach, and then the face.

STEVEN
Where's Robin?!

CABLE GUY
This isn't about Robin, this is about you
and me.

Steven charges directly at the Cable Guy.

STEVEN
Where's Robin?!!!

Steven tackles him to the ground, and begins hitting him. They are both covered in mud like 
warriors from the rain forest. Steven grabs a large rock and holds it over his head.

STEVEN
Tell me!

CABLE GUY
(nonchalantly)
I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question?

Steven brings down the rock. At the last moment the Cable Guy moves his head. The rock slams 
into the ground.

CABLE GUY
Steven you've changed.
(beat - then impressed)
I like it.

The Cable Guy convulses his body, pushing Steven off him.

They wrestle on the ground. The Cable Guy gets on top of Steven, then pulls a power drill out of 
his belt and turns it on.

CABLE GUY
I think it's time to make you cable ready.

He slowly brings the drill down to Steven. Steven blindly reaches behind him. He grasps a large 
branch and bats the Cable Guy off him.

The Cable Guy grabs a large tree brance and runs towards Steven. They begin fighting in a fashion 
which mirrors their Medieval Times swordfight.

CABLE GUY
Last time we fought I let you win! Best
two out of three!

MUSIC UP: Ominous version of the 'Star Trek' battle music.

CABLE GUY
(crazed)
You treat me like the TV! You use me, but
you can't live without me!

The Cable Guy smashes Steven in the knee with his branch.

CABLE GUY
You can't shut me off with your remote
control!!!! I'm not like Robin and Rick
and Mommy and Daddy and brother and
sister and cousin --

Steven smashes him in the head with the branch.

STEVEN
I got the point.

The Cable Guy goes down. He appears to be unconscious.

ROBIN
(in the distance)
Steven.

He looks to the dish, but cannot see her.

123	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - MOMENTS LATER

Steven climbs over the edge into the dish. Below him he sees that the bottom of the dish is filled 
with several feet of rain water.

Three wires go from the points on the edge of the dish, and meet at a point at the center of the 
satellite, thirty feet above the floor of the dish. ROBIN is hanging by her bound hands from the 
center of where those wires meet.

Steven climbs down towrd the bottom of the dish.

ROBIN
Help me Steven!

In the background we see the blurry image of the Cable Guy climbing through an entry hatch at 
the top of the dish. Robin's eyes fill with terror.

ROBIN
Steven! Look out!

CABLE GUY
(mimics her)
Yeah Steven. Look out!

The Cable Guy leaps out of the hatch like a jack-in-the-box. He slides down the dish, knocking 
Steven down. The two tumble down the slope of the dish, and tumble all the way down into the 
water.

CABLE GUY
(sweetly, like a girl)
I've missed you.

The Cable Guy immediately punches Steven, sending him back into the water. The Cable Guy 
dives on top of him. A moment later the Cable Guy pulls Steven up, then grabs his collar and 
speaks right into his face.

CABLE GUY
(dramatically)
"Dry land is not a myth, I've seen it."
Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don't
know what the fuss was about, the movie
ruled, I saw it six times.

He pulls Steven under the water, and tries to hold him there. He pulls him up after a few moments.

CABLE GUY
Isn't it weird that we'vve wound up in
this position?

He pushes him under the water again. After a moment he pulls him back up. Steven gasps for air.

CABLE GUY
Who would have thunk it?

Enraged, Steven punches him in the mouth with such tremendous force that it appears to have 
knocked his jaw out of alignment.

CABLE GUY
(without any lisp)
You're gonna have to do better than that
Steven.
(realizing his lisp is gone)
Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.

Steven hits him again, this time on the other side of the face.

CABLE GUY
(lisping again)
You stupid son of a bitch.

The Cable Guy falls unconscious.

ROBIN
Steven!

Steven runs to her.

124	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER

He runs to the side of the dish. He realizes he must climb up to release her. He climbs onto the 
WIRE and begins tightrope walking toward her. He walks very slowly, almost losing his balance 
several times.

STEVEN
Hang on.

CLOSE ON: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy's muddy hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.

CABLE GUY
(laughs maniacally)
I know what your saying. Who does this
guy think he is, Jason?

STEVEN
Stay away from her!

Suddenly, the Cable Guy does a front flip, and lands perfectly on the wire.

CABLE GUY
I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony
Curtis. He was just on "Life-styles of
the Rich and Famous." He still looks
terrific.

Steven is about ten feet from the dangling Robin, but the reverberation from the Cable Guy's 
landing makes Steven lose his balance. He falls over, but catches ont the wire. He is left hanging 
there.

The Cable Guy sees this, and begins to run incredibly fast toward Robin.

CABLE GUY
And the race is on.

He does a cartwheel on the strut, hops on one leg, then takes off toward her, running at full speed.

Steven, left with no other option, simply bounces up and down on the wire. Robin sees this and 
joins him.

The Cable Guy begins to lose his balance.

CABLE GUY
(knows he's about to fall)
This is such an anti-climactic way to end
this.

The Cable Guy loses his balance and falls to the water below. The Cable Guy has surely met his 
demise.

125	EXT. SATELLITTE DISH - LATER

Steven and Robin are sitting in the dish, a few feet from where the water begins. They are 
exhausted from their ordeal. They hold each other close.

ROBIN
I'm sorry I didn't believe you. I love
you.

STEVEN
I love you too. You're right. We
shouldn't get married. I've got a lot of
problems to work out which have
absolutely nothing to do with you.

ROBIN
We'll work them out together.

They kiss. Suddenly the Cable Guy pops up from underwater. He looks frightening. Then he starts 
coughing uncontrollably. He looks like a small boy who has swallowed too much water.

CABLE GUY
(between coughs)
What just happened? Where am I?
(remembers)
Oh yeah, I was trying to kill you.

He leaps at Steven, and puts him in a head-lock. He squeezes until Steven passes out. The he lays 
him on the ground.

CABLE GUY
(to Robin)
It's a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it
on Sly Stallone in "Rocky Three." He
should wake up in thirty seconds, so
let's get going.

He holds her around the neck, and puts a staple gun to her head, then walks her out of the dish.

Steven slowly wakes up. He looks and sees the Cable Guy and Robin beginning to climb up the 
rdio antenna. He quickly gets up to follow them.

126 EXT. ANTENNA - NIGHT

The Cable Guy and Robin climb the antenna. Steven follows them up from a distance.

The Cable Guy and Robin reach a platform at the top of the antenna. The Cable Guy holds Robin 
with one hand, and holds a staple gun to her temple with the other hand. Steven climbs onto the 
platform.

STEVEN
Easy.

He walks with Robin to the edge of the platform. There is a one-hundred foot drop to the dish 
below. A police helicopter hovers in the air around them.

CABLE GUY
It didn't have to be this way Steven. I'm
just trying to show you the kind of
things that can happen when you mistreat
people.

STEVEN
Don't do anything stupid.

CABLE GUY
You know this is just like that secen in
that Clint Eastwood movie "Dirty Harry" --

STEVEN
(snaps)
No! This is not like anything! This is
not a movie! We're real people! You're
hurting us! This is reality!

The Cable Guy's eyes turn sad. This hits the Cable Guy like a sucker punch. Dazed, he lets go of 
Robin. She runs to Steven's arms.

From below we hear the sound of sirens. A pack of police cars pull up and surround the antenna. 
The Cable Guy's expression changes. He begins to look like a scared little boy.

CABLE GUY
If this is reality...
(he climbs onto the guard railing)
...I am outta here.

The Cable Guy slowly falls backward off the antenna.

STEVEN
Nooo!

Steven lunges for the Cable Guy, grabbing his forearm, then grabbing the antenna with the other 
hand.

STEVEN
You're not going anywhere.

The Cable Guy hangs high above the satellite dish. Steven tries to pull the Cable Guy back onto 
the platform, but the Cable Guy does not want to be saved.

STEVEN
Don't do this. You just need help. We all
get lonely.

CABLE GUY
Yeah, but I get really lonely.
(beat)
I mean, look at me.

STEVEN
You're gonna be fine. Just come on up.

CABLE GUY
(a long beat)
Steven, I think I sat too close to the
television. Mommy was right.

Steven can't hold onto his forearm any longer. The Cable Guy's arm slips and Steven grabs onto 
his hand at the last possible second.

CABLE GUY
It's too late for me, but there's a lot
of little Cable Boys out there who still
have a chance. Say good-bye to the baby-
sitter.

(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue)

The Cable Guy stops holding onto Steven's hand. He begins falling toward the dish below.

We hear a loud thud. The screen turns to white noise.

(Revised 11/14/95 - Pink)

We hear a loud thud. The screen turns to white noise.

128A	EXT. TOP OF THE ANTENNA - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Robin gasp.

128B	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - CONTINUOUS

From below we see the Cable Guy's silhouette motionless on the struts of the satellite dish.

128C	EXT. THE CITY - CONTINUOUS

A wide panorama of the city. All of the color televisions which can be seen through the many 
windows of apartments and houses turn to white noise.

128D	INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - CONTINUOUS

The television shows white noise. Everyone screams at the TV.

129	OMITTED

130	OMITTED

131	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - CONTINUOUS

The Cable Guy appears dead. The needle of the antenna sticks through his mid-section. A red light 
blinks at the tip of the needle. Then, the Cable Guy's eyes open.

CABLE GUY
Damn, that hurt like a mother. What the
hell was I thinking?
(looks at the needle)
Oh man, that stings.

Steven and Robin look relieved.

CABLE GUY
A little help here!

132	OMITTED

133	OMITTED

134	INT. COUCH POTATO APARTMENT - NIGHT

A pasty white couch potato stares at the white noise, not sure what to do. He turns and picks up a 
book. As music crescendos he begins to read.

135	EXT. SATELLITE DISH - LATER

The Cable Guy is being taken away on a stretcher toward an emergency helicopter. Steven and 
Robin are covered in police blankets. Steven calls to a paramedic.

STEVEN
Is he going to be all right?

PARAMEDIC
I don't know. It's in God's hands.

The paramedics put the Cable Guy on the helicopter. The helicopter flies away.

P.O.V. SHOT - From the helicopter looking down on Steven and Robin holding each other, 
getting smaller and smaller until they disappear.

136	INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

The Cable Guy lies in a stretcher next to the paramedic. He is barely conscious, struggling for 
survival.

PARAMEDIC
Hang in there buddy. Stay with me. Just
stay with me.

The Cable Guy's eyes slowly open. He motions for the paramedic to come closer.

CABLE GUY
Am I really your buddy?

137	EXT. SKY - DAWN

The helicopter flies away.

               FADE IN (BEFORE TITLES)

               EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE -- DUSK

               Silence -- complete silence for the urbanite, though the 
               oncoming darkness is punctuated by the sounds of farm country -- 
               a few birds, a distant rumble of thunder from some heavy 
               clouds on the horizon, a dog's barking.

               CAMERA PANS the green, squared-off flatland, lit only by a 
               fine sunset in its final throes. Then, gradually, starting 
               from nothing, a rumble is heard, quickly growing louder and 
               louder until the sound of a train can be recognized.

               CAMERA PANS quickly, discovering the railroad line atop a 
               man-made rise of land, and the speeding passenger train is 
               upon us, flashing by with a roar.

               Then, as if from nowhere, the figure of a man hits the 
               embankment and rolls crazily down to the bottom into the 
               thick underbrush alongside the tracks.

               CLOSE SHOT -- BODY

               It lies in the bushes, still, unmoving -- dead. CAMERA PANS 
               AWAY to the quiet peaceful countryside as the sound of the 
               train fades off until there is silence once more.

               TITLE MUSIC begins with a crash.

                                      (MAIN TITLES)

               DELETED

               FADE IN:

               EXT. MEGEVE -- DAY

               A handsome and elegant hotel perched on the mountain-side 
               overlooking the French resort town. A large, open sun deck -- 
               tables, gaily colored parasols, sun bathers.

               One of the latter is REGINA LAMPERT, a lovely young girl.

               She is, besides taking in the sun, involved in her favorite 
               activity -- eating.

               Then -- a dark, ominous shape intrudes in the f.g. FOCUS 
               CHANGES to bring into sharp relief a revolver -- shining, 
               black and ugly in the sunlight.

               REGGIE, unaware of her danger, continues to eat.

               The finger tightens around the trigger and finally the gun 
               shoots -- a stream of water arcs, with unerring aim, straight 
               into REGGIE's face.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including JEAN-LOUIS, a French boy of six or so. REGGIE looks 
               at him sternly.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (in for trouble)
                         Oh, la.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't tell me you didn't know it was 
                         loaded.
                              (calling)
                         Sylvie!

               WIDER ANGLE

               SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early 
               thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join 
               REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

                                     REGGIE
                         Isn't there something constructive 
                         he can do -- like start an avalanche?

                                     SYLVIE
                              (to JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Va jouer, mon ange.

               JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so 
               lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of 
               cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee.

                                     SYLVIE
                         When you start to eat like this 
                         something is the matter.

               No answer from REGGIE. SYLVIE begins reading a magazine as 
               REGGIE continues eating.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Ça alors! From Charles?

                                     REGGIE
                         He's the only husband I've got. I 
                         tried to make it work, I really have -- 
                         but --

                                     SYLVIE
                         But what?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know how to explain it. I'm 
                         just too miserable.

               REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards 
               the devastated table before following.

                                     SYLVIE
                         It is infuriating that your 
                         unhappiness does not turn to fat!

               INT. SWIMMING POOL -- DAY

               A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-
               covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows 
               beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their 
               conversation continuing.

                                     SYLVIE
                         But why do you want a divorce?

                                     REGGIE
                         Because I don't love him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         But that is no reason to get a 
                         divorce!

               EXT. HOTEL TERRACE -- DAY

               An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-
               worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, 
               their conversation continuing.

                                     SYLVIE
                         With a rich husband and this year's 
                         clothes you will not find it difficult 
                         to make some new friends.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sitting)
                         I admit I moved to Paris because I 
                         was tired of American Provincial,

                                      
                         but that doesn't mean I'm ready for 
                         French Traditional. I loathe the 
                         idea of divorce, Sylvie, but -- if 
                         only Charles had been honest with me -- 
                         that's all I ask of anybody -- the 
                         simple truth. But with him, everything 
                         is secrecy and lies. He's hiding 
                         something -- something frightening -- 
                         something terrible -- and evil.

               She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over 
               her. She wheels, terrified.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PERUVIAN SNOW-MASK

               A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the 
               face except for eyes, nose and mouth. The eyes inside this 
               particular mask stare down at REGGIE.

                                     MAN
                         Does this belong to you?

               CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly 
               by the man in the mask.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE is too 
               terrified to answer. Realizing this, the man, PETER JOSHUA, 
               takes off the snow-mask to reveal a handsome, tanned face.

                                     PETER
                         Oh, forgive me.
                              (indicating JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Is this yours?

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating SYLVIE)
                         It's hers. Where'd you find him, 
                         robbing a bank?

                                     PETER
                         He was throwing snowballs at Baron 
                         Rothschild.
                              (a pause)
                         We don't know each other, do we?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why, do you think we're going to?

                                     PETER
                         I don't know -- how would I know?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid I already know a great 
                         many people. Until one of them dies 
                         I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.

                                     PETER
                              (smiling)
                         Yes, of course. But you will let me 
                         know if anyone goes on the critical 
                         list
                              (he starts off)

                                     REGGIE
                         Quitter.

                                     PETER
                              (turning)
                         How's that?

                                     REGGIE
                         You give up awfully easy, don't you?

               Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation 
               and rises.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Viens, Jean-Louis, let us take a 
                         walk. I have never seen a Rothschild 
                         before.

               SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy 
               squirts PETER with his pistol.

                                     PETER
                              (drying)
                         Clever fellow -- almost missed me.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid you're blocking my view.

                                     PETER
                              (moving)
                         Sorry. Which view would you like?

                                     REGGIE
                         The one you're blocking. This is the 
                         last chance I have -- I'm flying 
                         back to Paris this afternoon. What's 
                         your name?

                                     PETER
                         Peter Joshua.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm Regina Lampert.

                                     PETER
                         Is there a Mr. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes.

                                     PETER
                         Good for you.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.

                                     PETER
                         Please, not on my account.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, you see, I don't really love 
                         him.

                                     PETER
                         Well, you're honest, anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- 
                         dishonesty infuriates me. Like when 
                         you go into a drugstore.

                                     PETER
                         I'm not sure I --

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you go in and you ask for some 
                         toothpaste -- the small size -- and 
                         the man brings you the large size. 
                         You tell him you wanted the small 
                         size but he says the large size is 
                         the small size. I always thought the 
                         large size was the largest size, but 
                         he says that the family size, the 
                         economy size and the giant size are 
                         all larger than the large size -- 
                         that the large size is the smallest 
                         size there is.

                                     PETER
                         Oh. I guess.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Joshua?

                                     PETER
                         Yes, but we're divorced.

                                     REGGIE
                         That wasn't a proposal -- I was just 
                         curious.

                                     PETER
                         Is your husband with you?

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. 
                         First it was separate rooms -- now 
                         we're trying it with cities. What do 
                         people call you -- Pete?

                                     PETER
                         Mr. Joshua.
                              (turning to go)
                         Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Now you're angry.

                                     PETER
                         No, I'm not -- I've got some packing 
                         to do. I'm also going back to Paris 
                         today.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who 
                         said: "When strangers do meet they 
                         should erelong see one another again"?

                                     PETER
                         Shakespeare never said that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How do you know?

                                     PETER
                         It's terrible -- you just made it 
                         up.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are 
                         you going to call me?

                                     PETER
                         Are you in the book?

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles is.

                                     PETER
                         Is there only one Charles Lampert?

               PANS to pick up a TAXI as it pulls up before the handsome 
               building. Inside are REGGIE, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS.

               As REGGIE climbs out and the DRIVER begins unloading her 
               suitcases.

                                     REGGIE
                         Goodbye, Sylvie, and thanks.
                              (She turns toward the 
                              house)

               JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out of the taxi window.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         When you get your divorce will you 
                         be going back to America?

               MED. SHOT -- THE TAXI

               REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised.

                                     SYLVIE
                         He knows everything.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to JEAN-LOUIS)
                         Don't you want me to stay?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Yes, of course -- but if you went 
                         back and wrote me a letter --

                                     REGGIE
                         -- you could have the stamps. I'll 
                         get you some here, okay?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Okay.

               REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries 
               her cases.  She presses the button that electrically opens 
               the front door.

               INT. APARTMENT LANDING -- DAY

               As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver.  
               He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door.

                                     REGGIE
                              (handing him a tip)
                         Merci.

               The driver leaves. She goes to the door and presses the 
               minuterie, the button that turns on the time-light, and the 
               lights come on. Then she rings the doorbell. There is no 
               answer. She rings again. Still nothing. Sighing, she digs 
               out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. At this 
               moment the minuterie expires, plunging the scene into 
               darkness.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE
                         Wonderful.

               She finds the button and the light goes on again. She inserts 
               the key and turns it.

               From REGGIE's p.o.v. as CAMERA PANS the entrance hall. It is 
               bare -- no furniture, no rug, no pictures, no nothing.

               She stares for a moment, then goes back out into the landing.

               It reads "MR. AND MRS. CHARLES LAMPERT."

               REGGIE looks at the plate in disbelief, then turns and hurries

                         Honorine -- !

               No answer.

               Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also 
               empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's 
               original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still 
               in the wall.

               She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING 
               crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, 
               too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and 
               throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain.

               She pulls open the drawers -- nothing!

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles -- !

               She turns, and running now, goes through another door to the 
               library, CAMERA FOLLOWING. The rows of shelves are as empty 
               as the rest of the apartment. She begins to turn in a circle, 
               looking for something, anything. In a panic she turns and 
               runs out, colliding suddenly with a MAN whom she (and we) 
               have not noticed until the moment of impact.

               REGGIE screams.

               INT. MORGUE -- DAY

               We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too- 
               familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin.

               Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's 
               and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer.

               GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and 
               reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.

               He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then 
               moves to the other end to uncover the head.  As the sheet 
               starts to lift:

               REGGIE as she looks down into the CAMERA. She closes her

                         Well, Madame -- ?

               She nods.

                         You are positive?

               She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         You loved him?

               GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT.

               CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the

               Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE, 
               sitting across from him. The office is as bare as most 
               policemen's offices. GRANDPIERRE studies the photo.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         We discovered your husband's body 
                         lying next to the tracks of the Paris-
                         Bourdeaux railroad line. He was 
                         dressed only in his pajamas. Do you 
                         know of any reason why he might have 
                         wished to leave France?

                                     REGGIE
                         Leave?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Your husband possessed a ticket of 
                         passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed 
                         from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this 
                         morning at seven.

                              (a pause)
                         I'm very confused.

               She starts to rummage through her bag. GRANDPIERRE shoves a 
               package of French cigarettes across the desk to her. But she 
               pulls a package of nuts out of her bag. She begins separating 
               the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing 
               the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an 
               instant.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         He was American?

                         Swiss.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Oh. Swiss. His profession?

                                     REGGIE
                         He didn't have one.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         He was a wealthy man?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know. I suppose so.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         About how wealthy would you say?

                         I don't know.

                         I don't know.

                         Besides yourself, who is his nearest 
                         relation?

                              (exploding)
                         C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment 
                         absurde!

                         I know.

                         I'm sorry.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         It is all right.

               GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button 
               on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it 
               into his mouth.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Is it all right?

                                     REGGIE
                         I wish you wouldn't.

               He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into 
               the drawer, closing it fiercely. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN sticks 
               his head in the door.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Les effets de Lampert.

               The POLICEMAN leaves and closes the door.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         On Wednesday last your husband sold 
                         the entire contents of the apartment 
                         at public auction. Furniture, 
                         clothing, kitchenware -- everything. 
                         The gallery, in complying with his 
                         wishes, paid him in cash. One million 
                         two hundred and fifty thousand New 
                         Francs. In dollars, a quarter of a 
                         million. The authorities in Bordeaux 
                         have searched his compartment on the 
                         train. They have searched it 
                         thoroughly. They did not find 
                         $250,000, Madame.

               He opens the desk drawer, puts the cigar back in his mouth 
               and lights a match by scratching it against the glass desk-
               top before he remembers REGGIE's request. He puts it back in 
               the drawer again. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters 
               again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits 
               on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into 
               the basket.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         These few things are all that was 
                         found in the train compartment. There 
                         was no other baggage. Your husband 
                         must have been in a great hurry.

               He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, 
               identifying each item as he does.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         One wallet containing four thousand 
                         francs -- one agenda --
                              (pausing, he opens 
                              the notebook)
                         -- his last notation was made 
                         yesterday -- Thursday --
                              (reading)
                         "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs-
                         Elysées"
                              (looking up)
                         Why there?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (dryly)
                         Obviously.
                              (returning to the 
                              items in the basket)
                         One ticket of passage to South America -- 
                         one letter, stamped but unsealed, 
                         addressed to you --

                                     REGGIE
                              (lighting up)
                         A letter? May I see it?

               GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as 
               she reads it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (reading)
                         "My dear Regina: I hope you are 
                         enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be 
                         so lovely this time of year. The 
                         days pass very slowly and I hope to 
                         see you soon. As always, Charles. 
                         P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. 
                         Your appointment has been changed."
                              (she looks up, puzzled)
                         Not very much, is it?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         We took the liberty of calling your 
                         dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we 
                         would learn something.

                                     REGGIE
                         Did you?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Yes. Your appointment has been 
                         changed.
                              (he smiles at his 
                              little joke, then 
                              returns to the basket)
                         One key to your apartment -- one 
                         comb -- one fountain pen --  one 
                         toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder
                              (he looks up)
                         -- that is all.

               He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts 
               to put the things back into the basket while he speaks:

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         If you will sign this list you may 
                         take the things with you.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sighing)
                         Is that all? Can I go now?

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         One more question. Is this your 
                         husband's passport?

               He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport 
               which he hands to her.

               INSERT -- PASSPORT

               The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it 
               to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's 
               photo. Under it is the name: "CHARLES LAMPERT."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     REGGIE
                         Of course it is.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And this?

               He hands her another passport.

               INSERT -- SECOND PASSPORT

               The cover is American. When it is opened, we see the identical 
               picture, but the name under it reads: "CHARLES VOSS."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't understand.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And this? And this?

               He hands her, one at a time, two more passports.

               INSERT -- THIRD AND FOURTH PASSPORTS

               One is Italian which, when opened, shows the same photo with 
               the name "CARLO FABRI." The other is Venezuelan, the same 
               photo, and the name "CARLOS MORENO."

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND GRANDPIERRE

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Have you nothing to say, Madame?

               REGGIE looks down at the four passports, then back to 
               GRANDPIERRE.

                                     REGGIE
                              (hopefully)
                         It's all right if you want to smoke 
                         your cigar now.

               INT. LAMPERT APARTMENT -- DUSK

               The house is empty as before. Now it is silent, the late 
               afternoon light coming from outside. REGGIE stands by a 
               window. A canvas airline bag rests on the floor nearby.

               Suddenly there is the noise of a DOOR OPENING.

               CLOSER SHOT -- REGGIE

               As her head turns, in alarm, toward the noise. There is a 
               moment of silence, then FOOTSTEPS are heard, coming closer.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As PETER enters.

                                     REGGIE
                              (surprised)
                         What are you doing here?

                                     PETER
                         I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted 
                         to tell you how sorry I am -- and to 
                         find out if there was anything I 
                         could do.

                                     REGGIE
                         How did you find out?

                                     PETER
                         It's in all the afternoon papers. 
                         I'm very sorry.

                                     REGGIE
                         Thank you.

               A silence.

                                     PETER
                         I rang the bell but I don't think 
                         it's working.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.

               He looks around for the light switch, then goes to it and 
               flicks it on -- nothing happens. He flicks it a few more 
               times.

                                     REGGIE
                         They must have turned off the 
                         electricity.

               She shakes her head. PETER looks around.

                                     PETER
                         Where did everything go?

                                     REGGIE
                         Charles sold it all -- at auction.

                                     PETER
                         Do you know what you're going to do?

                                     REGGIE
                         Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, 
                         I suppose.

                                     PETER
                         Doing what?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm a simultaneous translator -- 
                         like Sylvie, only she's English to 
                         French -- I'm French to English. 
                         That's what I did before I married 
                         Charles. The police probably think I 
                         killed him.

                                     PETER
                         Instant divorce you mean?

                                     REGGIE
                         Something like that. But I'm sorry 
                         it ended like this -- tossed off a 
                         train like a sack of third-class 
                         mail.

                                     PETER
                              (Taking her hand)
                         Come on. You can't stay here.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know where to go.

                                     PETER
                         We'll find you a hotel.

                                     REGGIE
                         Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady 
                         of leisure anymore.

                                     PETER
                         Something modest but clean -- and 
                         near enough to UNESCO so you can 
                         take a cab when it rains -- okay?

               She nods. He picks up the airlines bag and they start out.

               REGGIE stops at the door and looks back.

                                     REGGIE
                         I loved this room -- but Charles 
                         never saw it -- only what was in it. 
                         All those exquisite things --
                              (looking around)
                         I think I prefer it like this.

               INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of a phonograph. A hand appears, starts the record 
               on it spinning, then places the arm at the beginning.

               An instant later ORGAN MUSIC starts with a roar.

               INT. FUNERAL CHAPEL -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT of the coffin. It rests on a low platform, with a 
               bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open.

               Inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie 
               the remnants of Charles Lampert.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               The INSPECTOR sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his 
               hands in a prayer-like attitude. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing 
               row after row of empty wooden bench-like seats in the large, 
               dimly-lit, high-ceilinged room. Finally, in the first row, 
               REGGIE and SYLVIE are discovered. Besides GRANDPIERRE, they 
               are the only ones present. REGGIE turns around to look at 
               the empty room. They speak in whispers.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's not exactly what I'd call a 
                         large turn-out.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Didn't Charles have any friends?

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow.
                              (indicating GRANDPIERRE)
                         If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't 
                         even have him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         At least he knows how to behave at 
                         funerals.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- 
               he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper.

               TWO SHOT -- SYLVIE AND REGGIE

                                     SYLVIE
                         Have you no idea who could have done 
                         it?

                                     REGGIE
                         Until two days ago all I really knew 
                         about Charles was his name -- now it 
                         turns out I didn't even know that.

               The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of 
               daylight streams in. The WOMEN turn.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the 
               bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes 
               the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in 
               his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard 
               bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               As he watches GIDEON.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she watches him.

               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

               GIDEON arrives at the coffin. He stops, looks down at 
               LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid 
               succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle 
               from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry.

               He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to 
               sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to 
               sit somewhere else.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

                                     SYLVIE
                         Do you know him?

                                     REGGIE
                         I've never seen him before.

                                     SYLVIE
                         He must have known Charles pretty 
                         well.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can you tell?

                                     SYLVIE
                         He's allergic to him.

               SYLVIE turns and glances at GIDEON. Again, the sound of the 
               DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against 
               the outside brightness. When he closes the door we can see 
               "TEX" PENTHOLLOW, a slim, rangy man with sandy-colored hair, 
               a weatherbeaten face, washed-out blue-eyes -- also in his 
               forties. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a 
               bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs 
               from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string.

               He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING 
               him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at 
               the others present.

               TRAVELING SHOT -- TEX'S P.O.V.

               MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's, 
               then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA.

               MED. SHOT -- THE BIER

               As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying 
               on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the 
               coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his 
               lapel and throws it into the open box.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

                                     TEX
                              (heavy Texas accent)
                         Ariva durchy, Charlie.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As TEX turns away from the coffin and approaches REGGIE and 
               SYLVIE, addressing the latter -- after having first reached 
               for his hat which he discovers he isn't wearing.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...

               SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over. 
               addressing REGGIE this time.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, ma'am...

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes?

                                     TEX
                         Charlie had no call to handling it 
                         this-a-way. He sure didn't. No siree.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't understa--

               But TEX has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat.

               When he spots GIDEON, the two men stare at each other.

               Finally, TEX chooses a seat away from him and sits.

               MED. SHOT -- CHAPEL DOOR

               It flies open, this time with a bang, and the large MAN who 
               appears almost fills the frame.

               CLOSER SHOT -- TEX

               As the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid-snore.

               MED. SHOT -- THE DOOR

               Closing the door, we see HERMAN SCOBIE, a heavy-weight -- 
               tall and wide, but not fat -- with black hair combed straight 
               back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which 
               meet over his nose and join up. About the same age as the 
               first two men, SCOBIE is dressed in a battered raincoat, his 
               hands thrust deep in the pockets. He marches down the aisle. 
               Looking straight ahead, CAMERA PANNING with him. He stops 
               before the coffin and stares into it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to 
               dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. He stares hard 
               at the body, squinting his eyes. Then he removes one hand 
               from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, 
               picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, 
               into the coffin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

               The pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly 
               but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's 
               hands. There is no reaction.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE

               He watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. Then 
               finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks 
               back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after 
               him.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Having watched SCOBIE exit. Suddenly a hand falls on her 
               shoulder. She jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of 
               fright.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring a funeral ATTENDANT, a cadaverous type (aren't 
               they all) with a black cut-away coat and an over-solicitous, 
               unctuous manner. He is eternally bent at the waist, in a 
               sort of half bow. He offers REGGIE a letter which she takes.

                                     REGGIE
                         Merci, Monsieur.

                                     ATTENDANT
                         Pas du tout, madame, pardon -- pardon -- 
                         pardon.

               He backs off and is gone. REGGIE looks at the letter, back 
               and front, then starts to open it.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Who is it from?

                                     REGGIE
                         The American Embassy.

               She pulls out the letter and starts to read it.

               INSERT -- THE LETTER

               It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message 
               reads:

               "Dear Mrs. Lampert: Please drop by my office tomorrow at 
               noon-thirty. I am anxious to discuss the matter of your late 
               husband's death. Sincerely, (signed) H. Bartholomew."

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND SYLVIE

               SYLVIE has been reading over REGGIE's shoulder.

                                     SYLVIE
                         What is it about?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.  But if this is a sample 
                         of American diplomacy I'm buying a 
                         fallout shelter.

               EXT. THE AMERICAN EMBASSY -- ESTABLISHING -- DAY

               The fine old building in the Rue Gabriel.

               DELETED

               INT. EMBASSY CORRIDOR -- DAY

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator two young DIPLOMATIC TYPES 
               step in, immersed in conversation.

                                     1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         I bluffed the Old Man out of the 
                         last pot -- with a pair of deuces.

                                     2ND DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         What's so depressing about that?

                                     1ST DIPLOMATIC TYPE
                         If I can do it, what are the Russians 
                         doing to him?

               The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and 
               starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door.

               MED. SHOT -- DOOR

               It is marked "307-A  H. BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE checks the 
               letter, then opens the door.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY

               The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk 
               is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for 
               somebody, notices that the door to the private office is 
               slightly ajar.

                                     REGGIE
                              (tentatively)
                         Hello -- ?
                              (there is no answer)
                         Hello?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                              (from the private 
                              office)
                         Is there anything wrong, Miss 
                         Tompkins?

                                     REGGIE
                         Uh -- Miss Tompkins isn't here.

               BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale 
               grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than 
               his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes 
               him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy 
               tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause 
               him to push them back in place every so often with a quick 
               automatic motion.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I'm sorry -- my secretary must have 
                         gone to lunch. You are -- ?

                                     REGGIE
                         Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking at his watch)
                         Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite 
                         late.

               He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do 
               so.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S PRIVATE OFFICE -- DAY

               A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three 
               kids on the desk. BARTHOLOMEW indicates a chair, then goes 
               behind his desk and sits. A can of lighter fluid stands open 
               on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Excuse me for a moment, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         it's a stubborn little devil.

               He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and 
               hankie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Dry-cleaningwise, things are all 
                         fouled up. I had a good man -- an 
                         excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, 
                         but H.Q. asked us to use the plant 
                         here in the building -- to ease the 
                         gold outflow.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you 
                         know who I am?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking up)
                         Charles Lampert's widow -- yes?
                              (going back to the 
                              tie)
                         Last time I sent out a tie only the 
                         spot came back.

               He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his 
               tie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Voilà! As they say.

               He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the 
               hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.

               He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches 
               wrapped in waxpaper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of 
               mustard, a bottle of red wine and two Dixie cups.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Have some, please. I've got...
                              (checking)
                         ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken 
                         and -- liverwurst.

                                     REGGIE
                         No thanks.

               He uncorks the wine, fills a cup and begins eating.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. 
                         Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't suppose it's an airline, is 
                         it?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean spies and things like that?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Only we call them agents.

                                     REGGIE
                         We? You mean you're --?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't 
                         think that you people were supposed 
                         to admit --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- 
                         trying to run a bureau of overworked 
                         men with under-allocated funds. 
                         Congress seems to think that all a 
                         spy needs --

                                     REGGIE
                         Agent.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes -- That all he needs is a code 
                         book and a cyanide pill and he's in 
                         business.

                                     REGGIE
                         What's all this got to do with me, 
                         Mr. Bartholomew?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (his mouth full)
                         Your husband was wanted by the U. S. 
                         government.

                                     REGGIE
                         May I have a sandwich, please?

               He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         To be more specific, he was wanted 
                         by this agency.

                                     REGGIE
                              (eating)
                         So that was it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes. We knew him, of course, by his 
                         real name.

                                     REGGIE
                              (almost choking)
                         His -- real -- ?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, 
                         Mrs. Voss --
                              (taking a photo from 
                              his desk)
                         -- I'd like you to look at this 
                         photograph, please -- by the way, 
                         you saw this one, didn't you?
                              (indicating the kids 
                              on the desk)
                         Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.

                                     REGGIE
                         Very sweet.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Aren't they?  Now look at this one, 
                         Mrs. Voss, and --

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop calling me that! Lampert's the 
                         name on the marriage license.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes -- and tell me if you recognize 
                         anyone. Just a moment. Have a good 
                         look.

               He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which 
               he gives her.

               FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sitting behind a table. The 
               glass is held over the first, magnifying the face.

               CLOSER SHOT -- PHOTO

               It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's Charles!

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Very good.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         He looks so young -- when was this 
                         taken?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         1944. The next face, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the next man -- a young TEX.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's the man who came to the funeral 
                         yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a 
                         tall man in a corduroy suit and string 
                         tie.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Does the name Tex Penthollow mean 
                         anything to you?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Next, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the third face -- a young GIDEON.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes -- and he was there, too -- a 
                         little fatter now -- and less hair -- 
                         but it's the same one.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. 
                         Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         The last one, please.

               The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young 
               SCOBIE.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's a face you don't forget -- he 
                         was there too --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Herman Scobie. And you've never seen 
                         him before, either?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         No, thank heaven.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (a pause, regarding 
                              her)
                         Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a 
                         great deal of danger.

                                     REGGIE
                         Danger? Why should I be in any danger?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         You're Charles Voss's wife -- now 
                         that he's dead you're their only 
                         lead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying 
                         to frighten me you're doing a really 
                         first-rate job!
                              (she takes another 
                              sandwich)

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         it's your only chance.

                                     REGGIE
                         Gladly, only I don't know what you 
                         want! You haven't told me.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. 
                         Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 
                         Charles Voss received from the 
                         auction. Those three men want it, 
                         too -- they want it very badly.

                                     REGGIE
                         But it's Charles's money, not theirs.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (laughing)
                         Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see 
                         you try and convince them of that!
                              (drying his eyes)
                         Oh, dear.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then whose is it? His or theirs?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Ours.

                                     REGGIE
                              (she looks at him for 
                              a moment)
                         Oh, I see.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         And I'm afraid we want it back.

                                     REGGIE
                         But I don't have it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's impossible. You're the only 
                         one who could have it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the 
                         truth.

               BARTHOLOMEW is silent for a moment, thinking.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I believe you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Thanks very much.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Oh, you've got the money all right -- 
                         you just don't know you've got it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter 
                         of a million dollars, believe me, 
                         I'd know it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've 
                         got it.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean it's just lying around 
                         someplace -- all that cash?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Or a safe deposit key, a certified 
                         check, a baggage claim -- you look 
                         for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite 
                         sure you'll find it.

                                     REGGIE
                         But --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look 
                         just as hard and as fast as you can. 
                         You may not have a great deal of 
                         time. Those men know you have it 
                         just as surely as we do. You won't 
                         be safe until the money's in our 
                         hands. Is that clear?

               REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears 
               it off, handing it to her.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Here's where you're to call me -- 
                         day or night. It's a direct line to 
                         both my office and my apartment. 
                         Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and 
                         please don't tell anyone about coming 
                         to see me. It could prove fatal for 
                         them as well as yourself.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wait a minute -- you think those 
                         three men killed Charles, don't you?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We've no proof, of course, but we 
                         rather think so, yes.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, there you are! Charles had the 
                         money with him -- so whoever killed 
                         him has it -- they have it!

               BARTHOLOMEW shakes his head.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why not?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (grimly)
                         Because they're still here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid 
                         you're in a great deal of danger. 
                         Remember what happened to Charles.

               REGGIE takes the last sandwich and begins eating furiously.

               DELETED

               EXT. ESPLANADE DES CHAMPS-ELYÉES -- DAY

               MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL.

               One of the French Punch and Judy shows set up on certain 
               days in the small park alongside the broad avenue between 
               the Rond Point and the Place de la Concorde. At the moment, 
               Judy, as always, is beating Punch with a bat. The sound of 
               CHILDREN laughing and screaming can be heard.

               VARIOUS CLOSE SHOTS -- THE CHILDREN

               Sitting on small benches lined up to face the stage. Their 
               attention is fixed on the show, their belief totally suspended 
               by the play as only children's can be -- laughing at the 
               slapstick, booing the villain, frightened by the perils.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Sitting on the last bench, next to some CHILDREN. They are 
               laughing but she isn't -- she just watches, her attention 
               caught up but her face void of emotion. The bench is too low 
               for her, forcing her knees up almost under her chin.

               After a moment, PETER comes up behind her and, stepping over 
               the benches, sits beside her. She doesn't seem to notice.

               [Throughout the following scene the CHILDREN and the ACTORS 
               can be heard in the b.g.]

                                     PETER
                         Reggie -- ?

               She turns and looks at him for a moment.

                                     REGGIE
                              (vaguely)
                         Hallo, Peter.

                                     PETER
                         You telephoned me to meet you. I've 
                         been standing on the corner back 
                         there -- waiting for you.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry -- I heard the children 
                         laughing.

               A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the 
               stage.

               MED. SHOT -- GUIGNOL

               PUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         What's going on?

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't you understand French?

                                     PETER
                         I'm still having trouble with English.

                                     REGGIE
                         The man and the woman are married --

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes, I can see that -- they're batting 
                         each other over the head with clubs.

               Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing 
               a three-cornered hat appears.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who's that with the hat?

               MED SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE

               Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's the policeman -- he wants to 
                         arrest Judy for killing Punch.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What's she saying now?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That she's innocent -- she didn't do 
                         it.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         She did it, all right -- take it 
                         from me.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I believe her.

               PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says 
               something, then ducks out.

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Who was that?

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Punch, of course.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         Of course? I thought he was dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         He's only pretending, to teach her a 
                         lesson -- only --
                              (her face clouding)
                         only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- 
                         he's not pretending. Somebody threw 
                         him off a train. What am I going to 
                         do?

               Charles was mixed up in something terrible.

                                     PETER
                         I wish you'd let me help you. Whatever 
                         it is, it doesn't sound like the 
                         sort of thing that a woman can handle 
                         all by herself.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GUIGNOL STAGE

               JUDY has gotten the upper hand is now batting the POLICEMAN's 
               brains out.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

                                     PETER
                         Have you got a mirror?
                              (she nods)
                         Give it to me.

               She hands it to him and he holds it in front of her face.

                                     PETER
                         Right there, between your eyes -- 
                         see? Worry lines. You're much too 
                         young and too pretty to have anything 
                         like that. How about making me vice-
                         president in charge of cheering you 
                         up?

                                     REGGIE
                              (jumping at the 
                              suggesting)
                         Starting tonight?

               INT. NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- EMCEE.

               He stands on the dance floor in front of a five piece Latin 
               dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional 
               smile as he speaks into a mike.

                                     EMCEE
                         Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs, good 
                         evening ladies and gentlemen, guten 
                         Abend, meine Damen und Herren -- ce 
                         soir, comme tous les soirs, 
                         l'attraction ici, au Black Sheep 
                         Club, c'est vous! Venez, mesdames et 
                         messieurs, step right up, ladies and 
                         gentlemen, kommen Sie her, meine 
                         Damen en Herren, avanti, signore e 
                         signori -- avanti!

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND PETER

               At their table. REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress.

                                     PETER
                         What was all that?

                                     REGGIE
                         Fun and games. Evidently we're the 
                         floorshow.

                                     PETER
                         You mean you and me?

                                     REGGIE
                         No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, 
                         avanti!

               She rises and pulls him along.

               WIDE ANGLE

               Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, 
               laughing self-consciously and looking around.

                                     EMCEE
                         Écoutez bien -- les règles sont tres 
                         simples -- the rules are very easy -- 
                         deux équipes -- two teams -- each 
                         with one orange -- une orange -- 
                         eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- 
                         held under the chin, like so --
                              (does it)
                         comme ça -- and passed to the player 
                         behind you -- sans vous servir de 
                         vos mains -- using nothing but the 
                         chin -- no hands -- and keeping the 
                         orange at all costs from touching 
                         the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et 
                         Messieurs -- begin, ladies and 
                         gentlemen -- signore e signori, 
                         comminciate!

               The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons 
               to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. 
               REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line.

               Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one 
               under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man 
               at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the 
               game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women 
               behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under 
               their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using 
               their hands.

               (This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's 
               partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against 
               the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly 
               enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next 
               in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest 
               miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of 
               human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co-
               ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the 
               orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can 
               only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide 
               from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on 
               the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve 
               it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity 
               which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even 
               new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be 
               a torment for total strangers and/or the English).

               VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME

               Some of the couples in various states of confusion, 
               entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, 
               hilarious.

               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

               It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but 
               quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an 
               abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the 
               twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber 
               the game but increase his worldly experience.

               The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to 
               move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success 
               difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange 
               starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after 
               it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               She is enjoying it thoroughly.

               TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL

               Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, 
               PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange 
               under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations 
               from members of his TEAM.

               Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment.

                                     PETER
                         En garde.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lay on, MacDuff.

               They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all 
               possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers 
               seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they 
               are too good despite themselves and the transfer is 
               accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM.

               REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, 
               turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an 
               embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, 
               the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in 
               BARTHOLOMEW's photo.

               REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly.

               Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly 
               in REGGIE's ear.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON

               Her eyes show her fright as he whispers:

                                     GIDEON
                         Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE
                         What do you want?

                                     GIDEON
                         Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Tell me what?

                                     GIDEON
                         It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         you do know that, don't you?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know anything.

                                     GIDEON
                         Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you 
                         could wake up dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Leave me alone -- !

                                     GIDEON
                         Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's 
                         news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert --

                                     REGGIE (SHOUTING)
                         Stop it!

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET

               As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

               He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he 
               merely closes his eyes.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well 
               as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward.

                                     PETER
                         Reggie -- what's the trouble?

               REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance.

               She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, 
               under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him 
               for a moment.

                                     REGGIE
                         He -- he was stepping on my foot.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON

               Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling 
               down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange.

                                     GIDEON
                         Forgive me -- it was quite 
                         unintentional, I'm sure.

               WIDER ANGLE

               GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (starting off)
                         Wait for me -- I won't be long.

               She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a 
               flight of stairs.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER

               Watching her go, a concerned look on his face.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

               A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's-
               women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door.

               The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes 
               down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light 
               and closing the door after her.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops 
               it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one 
               given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on 
               it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into 'phone)
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, Reggie 
                         Lampert -- listen Mr. Bartholomew: 
                         I've seen one of the
                              (she stops)
                         Mr. Bartholomew? Can you hear me?

               She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her 
               coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice.

                                     REGGIE
                         Hello -- Mr. Bartholomew -- it's me, 
                         Regina Lam...

               Suddenly the door of the booth opens and REGGIE wheels to 
               look, slamming the receiver down as she does.

               REVERSE SHOT -- 'PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               TEX PENTHOLLOW, the second man from the funeral (and photo), 
               the man in the corduroy suit and string tie, stands in the 
               doorway, his face calm, a hand-rolled but unlit cigarette in 
               his mouth. He has put one foot up against the side of the 
               door so she can't leave. REGGIE stares at him, terrified.

                                     TEX
                         Howdy, Miz Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wha -- what do you want?

               TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket.

                                     TEX
                         You know what I want, Miz Lampert...

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- no, I'm don't.

                                     TEX
                         Come on now -- sure you do. An' you'd 
                         better give it to me, Miz Lampert -- 
                         cuz I ain't foolin'. No sireebob!

               He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the 
               burning match in his hand afterward.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know what --

               TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the 
               booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically.

                                     REGGIE
                         What are you doing?

               TEX lights another match and throws it into her lap. She 
               beats this one out too.

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop that!

                                     TEX
                         Don't make too much noise, Miz Lampert --

               He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with 
               it. She shrinks back.

                                     TEX
                         It could get a whole lot worse.

               Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he 
               punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE 
               is too busy beating them out to do anything else.

                                     TEX
                         It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' 
                         if you don't give it to me your life 
                         ain't gonna be worth the paper it's 
                         printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', 
                         Miz Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         Please stop -- please!

                                     TEX
                         You think on it real careful-like, 
                         Miz Lampert -- y'hear?

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her 
               work.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're insane, absolutely insane!

               She looks up, then blinks her eyes.

               INT. 'PHONE BOOTH OVER REGGIE'S SHOULDER

               There is no one there. REGGIE rises and steps out of the 
               booth.

               INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE looks around. There is no one there.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH

               As REGGIE returns, sits and starts to put another jeton into 
               the slot. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back 
               into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her 
               mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her 
               eyes.

               Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time 
               it is PETER.

                                     PETER
                         What are you doing in here?

                                     REGGIE
                              (a sigh of relief)
                         Having a nervous breakdown.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby.

                                     PETER
                         You haven't said a word since we 
                         left the club -- what happened back 
                         there?

                                     REGGIE
                         I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to 
                         tell you or not.

                                     PETER
                         I don't think I follow you.

                                     REGGIE
                         He said if I told anybody it could 
                         prove fatal for them as well as me.

                                     PETER
                         Who said?

                                     REGGIE
                         That's what I'm not supposed to say.

                                     PETER
                         Stop this nonsense! If you're in 
                         some sort of trouble I want to know 
                         about it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying 
                         me.

                                     PETER
                         I wasn't --

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, you were -- you called it 
                         nonsense. Being murdered in cold 
                         blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it 
                         happens to you sometime.

               She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT 
               CLERK greets them sleepily.

                                     NIGHT CLERK
                         Bonsoir.

                                     REGGIE
                         Bonsoir. Quarante-deux, s'il vous 
                         plait.

               The NIGHT CLERK gets the key off a hook and hands it to 
               REGGIE.

                                     NIGHT CLERK
                         Bonne nuit.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to PETER)
                         Would you mind seeing me to the door?

                                     PETER
                         Of course not.

               They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat 
               cramped, forcing them to stand close together.

                                     REGGIE
                         This is quite a place for making 
                         friends, isn't it?

               He presses the button and the elevator starts to rise.

                                     PETER
                         You said this afternoon that your 
                         husband was mixed up in something.

                                     REGGIE
                              (busy examining the 
                              cleft in his chin)
                         How do you shave in there?

                                     PETER
                         What was it?

                                     REGGIE
                         What was what?

                                     PETER
                         What your husband was mixed up in.

                                     REGGIE
                         Look, I know it's asking you to 
                         stretch your imagination, but can't 
                         you pretend for a moment that I'm a 
                         woman and that you're a --

                                     PETER
                         Don't you know I could already be 
                         arrested for transporting a minor 
                         above the first floor?

               The elevator stops.

                                     PETER
                         We're here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Where?

                                     PETER
                         On the street where you live.

                                     REGGIE
                         How about once more around the park?

               He reaches across her and opens the door.

                                     PETER
                         Out.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE leaves the elevator, followed by PETER. They walk 
               to her door. There is a moment of silence as she looks at 
               him.

                                     REGGIE
                              (imitating PETER)
                         Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a 
                         nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it 
                         is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, 
                         all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll 
                         behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, 
                         I never make promises I can't keep.'

                                     PETER
                         How would you like a spanking?

                                     REGGIE
                         How would you like a punch in the 
                         nose? Stop treating me like a child.

                                     PETER
                         Then stop acting like one. If you're 
                         really in some kind of trouble, I'd 
                         like to hear about it. Otherwise, 
                         it's late, I'm tired and I'm going 
                         home to bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you know what's wrong with you?

                                     PETER
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         Nothing. Good night.

                                     PETER
                         Good night.

               He turns and leaves. She smiles slightly, then turns and 
               puts the key into the door and opens it.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Featuring the door. REGGIE enters, then stops abruptly, the 
               doorknob still in her hand.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               The room has been torn apart. And standing in the center is 
               HERMAN SCOBIE, the large man in the battered raincoat.

               He starts slowly advancing toward REGGIE.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Where is it, lady -- where've you 
                         got it?

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

                                     REGGIE
                              (terrified)
                         I don't know -- I don't know! I don't --

               She stops as she sees something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S HAND

               Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one.

               WIDER ANGLE

               SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, 
               then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike.

                                     SCOBIE
                         I want it -- give it to me -- it's 
                         mine!

               The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, 
               turns and flies out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (screaming)
                         Peter -- ! Peter -- !

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal 
               hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and 
               splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified 
               with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding 
               claw.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand.

                                     REGGIE
                         A man -- he tried to kill me!

               Pulling her aside, PETER takes hold of the key (still in the 
               outside lock) and turns it slowly and quietly. Then, using 
               all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, 
               making sure to hold it that way as he steps in.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled 
               SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but 
               he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, 
               sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, 
               head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he 
               disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door 
               and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free.

               He then rushes to the open window and climbs out.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly 
               looks into the room.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (entering cautiously)
                         Peter -- ?
                              (alarmed)
                         Peter! Where are you?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Showing the disarranged room, empty of people. Then, slowly 
               PETER's hand appears from behind the bed, shaking groggily.

               REGGIE rushes to him and helps him sit on the bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Peter -- are you all right?

                                     PETER
                         I think I sprained my pride.
                              (He looks around)
                         Where'd he go?

                                     REGGIE
                         Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't 
                         see him.

               PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks 
               out. He then turns back.

                                     PETER
                         Lock the door and the window -- and 
                         don't let anyone in except me. I'll 
                         be back in a minute.

                                     REGGIE
                         Be careful, Peter.

                                     PETER
                              (one leg over the 
                              sill)
                         You took the words right out of my 
                         mouth.

               He climbs out.

               EXT. HOTEL WINDOW THIRD FLOOR -- NIGHT

               Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, 
               consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between 
               it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears 
               and looks down over the railing.

               EXT. HOTEL SIDEWALK (FROM ABOVE) -- NIGHT

               SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it 
               is too far to jump.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER -- BALCONY

               He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on 
               one side, but there are two or three on the other.

               PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one 
               hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PETER'S HAND

               As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short 
               of touching it.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he straightens up and prepares to jump.

               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

               From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees 
               a light coming through the window and looks in.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Oh!

               PETER leaves the window quickly, climbing over the railing 
               on his way to the next balcony. As he does, the following 
               exchange is heard (in British English).

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         What is it now, Pamela?

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It happened again, Henry -- another 
                         strange man peered in the window at 
                         me and then went away.

                                     MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Bad luck, Pamela.

               EXT. HOTEL FACADE -- NIGHT

               From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony.

               MED. SHOT -- PETER

               As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a 
               light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in.

               MED. SHOT -- WINDOW -- OVER PETER'S SHOULDER

               Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of 
               a heated discussion.

                                     GIDEON
                         That was a dumb move, Herman -- a 
                         dumb move.

                                     TEX
                         And then some. If you'd only told us 
                         you was goin' to her room we could've 
                         kept 'em busy --

               INT. GIDEON'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                         -- but sneakin' in there on your own 
                         that-a-way, why, man, you was bound 
                         to get yore tokus kicked. I mean, 
                         what'd you think he'd do -- walk up 
                         'n' shake you by that hand o' yores?

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         That's right, Herman -- you didn't 
                         leave me much choice.

               They all turn toward the window.

               WIDER ANGLE

               As PETER climbs in through the window and joins them.

                                     PETER
                              (to SCOBIE)
                         I didn't hurt you, did I?

               SCOBIE shakes his head and turns away.

                                     GIDEON
                              (eagerly)
                         Never mind that -- did you get the 
                         money?

                                     PETER
                         How could I with the three Marx 
                         Brothers breathing down my neck? You 
                         said you'd let me handle it alone --
                         ! The girl trusts me. If she's got 
                         it, I'll find out about it. But you've 
                         got to leave me alone.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (to GIDEON and TEX)
                         We took all the chances. The money 
                         belongs to us, not him!

                                     TEX
                         Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- 
                         don't forget he done us a little ol' 
                         favor.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Yeah? What's that?

                                     TEX
                         He took care of Charlie for us.

                                     GIDEON
                              (to PETER)
                         We appreciate it, really we do.

                                     SCOBIE
                         But who asked him? Three shares are 
                         enough -- I'd say he's out!

                                     PETER
                         A third of nothing is nothing, Herman. 
                         Make up your minds -- she's waiting 
                         for me.

                                     GIDEON
                              (thoughtfully)
                         I don't see how another twenty-four 
                         hours could hurt.

                                     TEX
                         Shoot no, not after all these years.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Then he gets it out of your share, 
                         not mine! Not mine!

               SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it.

               GIDEON begins sneezing, takes a bottle of pills from his

                         I suggest you get about your business -- 
                         nothing soothes Herman like success.

                         That's right -- it's like ticklin' a 
                         alligator's belly.

                                     PETER
                         Who's got the room next to hers?

                         Me. How come?

                                     PETER
                         Get another one, will you? I'm going 
                         to need it.

               PETER starts for the door.

                         If you do find the money -- you won't 
                         forget t' tell us about it, will 
                         you, fella?

                                     PETER
                              (turning at the door)
                         Don't worry.

                         Oh, I ain't worryin' -- but see this 
                         pudgy little fella here?
                              (indicating GIDEON)
                         He worries -- an' he's even meaner'n 
                         I am.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As she waits anxiously, smoking a cigarette. There is a KNOCK 
               at the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         Who is it?

                                     PETER'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's me. Peter.

               REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she 
               closes the door again --

                                     PETER
                         There was no trace of him. All right, 
                         Reggie -- suppose you tell me what 
                         this is all about.

                                     REGGIE
                         There are three men -- he's one of 
                         them -- they think I have something 
                         that belongs to them.

                                     PETER
                         What?

                                     REGGIE
                         A quarter of a million dollars.

               PETER is silent for a moment.

                                     PETER
                         Go on.

                                     REGGIE
                         That's all.

                                     PETER
                         No, it isn't -- where's the money?

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know.  Those men killed 
                         Charles to get it. But he must not 
                         have had it with him on the train.

                                     PETER
                         So they think he left it with you.

                                     REGGIE
                         But he didn't! I've looked everywhere --
                              (tears welling)
                         And if I don't find it --
                              (wailing)
                         Those men going to kill me.

               She falls in his arms to be comforted.

                                     PETER
                         No, they won't -- I won't let them.

                                     REGGIE
                              (sobbing)
                         Please help me, Peter -- you're the 
                         only one I can trust.

                                     PETER
                         Of course I'll help -- I told you I 
                         would, didn't I? Come on now --

               He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm so hungry I could faint.
                              (trying to smile)
                         I've -- I've gotten your suit all 
                         wet.

                                     PETER
                         That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.

                                     REGGIE
                         Peter, you've got to promise me 
                         something. Promise you'll never lie 
                         the way Charles did. Why do people 
                         have to tell lies?

                                     PETER
                         Usually it's because they want 
                         something -- and they're afraid the 
                         truth won't get it for them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you tell lies?

               A pause. The phone rings. REGGIE answers it.

                                     REGGIE

                         he still there?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face.

               He watches her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes -- that's right.

                                     PETER
                         What is it, Reggie -- what's he 
                         saying?

               She shakes her head.

                         Don't trust him -- don't tell him 
                         anything. He's after the money.

               He hangs up.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Slowly, REGGIE lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it 
               up.  She hesitates a moment.

                                     PETER
                         What'd he say?

                                     REGGIE
                         He -- he said if I didn't give the 
                         money, he'll kill me.

                                     PETER
                         I wouldn't take that too seriously.

                                     REGGIE
                         I believe what he said.

                                     PETER
                         They're only trying to scare you, 
                         that's all.

                                     REGGIE
                         How do you know what they're doing?

                                     PETER
                         I don't -- but as long as they think 
                         you have the money, or know where it 
                         is, or have it without knowing where 
                         it is, or don't even know you have 
                         it --

                                     REGGIE
                         What are you talking about?

                                     PETER
                         You mustn't let what he said bother 
                         you. It was only words.

                                     REGGIE
                              (softly)
                         Words can hurt very much.

                                     PETER
                              (a pause)
                         Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the 
                         morning.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't put yourself out.

                                     PETER
                         Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember 
                         that.

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, I'll remember. Good night.

                                     PETER
                         Good night.

               He starts out, pausing by the door and examining the hole 
               SCOBIE made in it.

                                     PETER
                         But if you'll take my advice --
                              (smiling)
                         You'll undress in the closet. Oh, 
                         and if you need me, just bang on the 
                         wall. I'll be next door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes 
               the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, 
               then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one 
               of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- 
               and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock 
               has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down 
               near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of 
               the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the 
               thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it 
               underneath.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As DYLE enters, the thread in his hand. He goes to a nearby 
               table where he attaches the thread to the heavy room key, 
               which he then balances on the extreme edge of the table.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE is on the phone.

                         -- But I am calm, Mr. Bartholomew -- 
                         what I called to tell you was there's 
                         someone else -- someone who wasn't 
                         in that photograph you showed me. He 
                         says his name is Peter Joshua -- but 
                         it isn't -- it's Dyle.
                              (a pause)

                         Bartholomew, I'm catching the next 
                         plane out of here -- I'm not going 
                         to sit here and wait for someone to 
                         make chopped liver out of me!

                         Where are you now -- can you meet 
                         me? Do you know Les Halles?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, where?
                              (a pause)
                         -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.

               DELETED

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE hangs up the phone, picks up her bag, checks her hair 
               in the mirror, then starts for the door. She stops as she 
               notices the connecting door leading to the room next door, 
               DYLE's room. She goes to it, silently slips out the key and 
               bends to peer through the keyhole.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT (THROUGH KEYHOLE)

               DYLE is removing his coat. Before he lays it over a chair, 
               he takes a gun from the inside pocket, checks it, and tucks 
               it into his belt.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE reacts in surprise and fright, jumps quickly away 
               from the door. She hurries to the door leading to the hall 
               and reaches for the knob.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOM KEY. The thread attached to it is pulled 
               (by the action of REGGIE's door opening) and the key falls 
               to the floor with a clatter.

               WIDE ANGLE

               Including DYLE as he reacts, his head wheeling to look at 
               the key. Snatching his coat, he runs for the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE sneaks past DYLE's door. When she has passed, the 
               door opens and DYLE appears. REGGIE takes off on the run, 
               turning the corner and starting down the stairs.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- !

               He starts after her.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               It is deserted, except for the sleeping NIGHT PORTER, as 
               REGGIE comes running down the stairs.

                                     DYLE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Reggie... !

               She turns, looking back towards the sound of his voice, but 
               does not slacken her speed. She runs out the front door.

               EXT. HOTEL ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE runs out. She looks up the street, sees a TAXI and 
               hails it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Taxi -- !

               It pulls over to the curb. Looking once more over her shoulder 
               she takes a bill out of her pocket, opens the cab door, slams 
               it loudly without getting in and hands the bill to the driver.

                                     REGGIE
                         N'importe où -- vite! Allez-y!

               She jumps back into the shadows of a nearby doorway as the 
               TAXI pulls away. At the same time DYLE runs out of the hotel.  
               Another TAXI is coming down the street. DYLE hails it 
               frantically.

                                     DYLE
                         Taxi -- ! Taxi -- !

               It pulls up and DYLE opens the door.

                                     DYLE
                              (pointing)
                         Follow that taxi.

                                     DRIVER
                         Comment?

                                     DYLE
                         Taxi! Follow!

                                     DRIVER
                         Je ne comprends rien.

               Desperately, DYLE reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out 
               a small dictionary and begins flipping through the pages.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               In the shadows. She lifts her eyes in annoyance.

               MED. SHOT -- TAXI

                                     DYLE
                              (finding the word)
                         Suivre -- el taxi!

                                     DRIVER
                         Ah! Oui, Monsieur.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               REGGIE comes out of the shadows, looks after DYLE's taxi, 
               then hails another one which pulls up.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to DRIVER)
                         Aux Halles -- vite!

               DELETED

               EXT. LES HALLES -- NIGHT

               REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW walking. The Central Market is teeming 
               with activity -- trucks creeping around other trucks, cases 
               of fruit and vegetables stacked on every inch of sidewalk, 
               WORKERS of all types milling around, unloading trucks and 
               stacking crates, little electric carts scooting in and out -- 
               and nearby, one of the huge, high-roofed sheds where the 
               butchers work.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW

               CAMERA LEADING them as they walk.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (looking around)
                         Incredible, isn't it? Zola called it 
                         'le ventre de Paris' -- the womb of 
                         Paris, the belly.

               She takes a banana from a nearby stall.

                                     REGGIE
                              (peeling it)
                         What did you want to see me about, 
                         Mr. Bartholomew?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (leaves a coin on the 
                              crate)
                         Were you followed?

                                     REGGIE
                         Yes, but I lost him. I really did it 
                         quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to 
                         think women make the best spies.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Agents.

                                     REGGIE
                         He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I 
                         saw it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Who?

                                     REGGIE
                         Dyle, or whatever his name is.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         What does your Mr. Dyle look like, 
                         Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Describe him.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- 
                         rather thin -- in good physical shape, 
                         I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite 
                         handsome, really.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (shaking his head)
                         No.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, what?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's not Carson Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                              (stopping)
                         Carson?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         There's only one Dyle connected with 
                         this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's 
                         Carson.

                                     REGGIE
                         You mean you've known about him all 
                         along? Why didn't you tell me?

               BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; 
               his attention is drawn inside the doorway.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         It's enough to make you a vegetarian, 
                         isn't it?

               INT. LES HALLES BUTCHERS' SHED -- NIGHT

               Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, 
               hung on hooks.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND BARTHOLOMEW (TRAVELING)

               As REGGIE looks at the hanging beef.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's just lucky that I'm not hanging 
                         next to one of those things right 
                         now.

               She shudders, throws away her banana and turns back to 
               BARTHOLOMEW.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you 
                         tell me you knew about Dyle?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.

                                     REGGIE
                         Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd 
                         better tell me what this thing's all 
                         about.

               INT. LES HALLES BISTRO -- NIGHT

               Lined up at a zinc bar are several BUTCHERS, their white 
               smocks stained with blood. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the 
               table.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I suppose you're old enough to have 
                         heard of World War Two?

                                     REGGIE
                         Barely, yes.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- 
                         the military espionage unit -- were 
                         ordered behind the German lines for 
                         the purpose of delivering $250,000 
                         in gold to the French Underground. 
                         The five men --

               A WAITER arrives.

                                     WAITER
                         Vous désirez?

                              (smiling)
                         They always do that.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (to the WAITER)
                         Café.

                         Gratinée, choucroute garnie, salade 
                         de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned 
                         on spending the entire night here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Can I at least keep the onion soup?

               BARTHOLOMEW shrugs.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to the WAITER)
                         La soupe tout simplement.

               The WAITER nods and goes.

                                     REGGIE
                              (anxiously)
                         Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- 
                         the French Underground --

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Yes. The five men. They were, of 
                         course, your husband, Charles, the 
                         three men who showed up at his funeral 
                         yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But 
                         something went wrong and they were 
                         unable to locate their contact. It 
                         must have been at that point that 
                         they decided to steal the money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Steal it how?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         By burying it, and then reporting 
                         that the Germans had captured it.  
                         All they had to do was come back 
                         after the war, dig it up and split 
                         it five ways -- a quarter of a million 
                         dollars with no questions asked.

                                     REGGIE
                              (fascinated)
                         May I have a cigarette, please?

               BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at 
               it and rips off the filter tip. He winces.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hate these things -- it's like 
                         drinking coffee through a veil.

               She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches 
               and lights it.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Everything went smoothly enough until 
                         after the gold was buried -- then, 
                         before they could get out, they were 
                         ambushed by a German patrol. A machine 
                         gun separated Scobie from his right 
                         hand -- and caught Carson Dyle full 
                         in the stomach.

               REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the 
               filter (he winces again) and puts it into her mouth.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         What's wrong with that one?

               He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically 
               brand-new in the ashtray.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Nothing, I guess. What happened 
                         then?

               She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly 
               examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first 
               cigarette.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Have you any idea what these things 
                         cost over here?

                                     REGGIE
                         Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- 
                         what happened then?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Scobie was able to travel, but Carson 
                         Dyle was clearly dying, so they --

               The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup.

                                     WAITER
                         La soupe, c'est pour qui?

                                     REGGIE
                         Pour moi. Go on, Mr. Bartholomew.

               The WAITER puts down the cup and bowl and leaves.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Carson was dying so they were forced 
                         to leave him. They finally got back 
                         to the base, made their report, and 
                         waited for the war to end. Only 
                         Charles couldn't wait quite as long 
                         as the others. He beat them back to 
                         the gold, took everything for himself 
                         and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, 
                         Tex and Scobie all this time to catch 
                         up with him again.

                                     REGGIE
                         But if they stole all that money -- 
                         why can't you arrest them?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We know what happened from the bits 
                         and pieces we were able to paste 
                         together -- but we still have no 
                         proof.

                                     REGGIE
                         But what has all this got to do with 
                         the C.I.O.?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an 
                         extension of the wartime O.S.S. It 
                         was our money and we want it back.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but 
                         nothing you've told me has changed 
                         my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- 
                         tonight.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert.  
                         You'd better consider what happened 
                         to your husband when he tried to 
                         leave. Those men won't be very far 
                         away -- no matter where you go. In 
                         fact, I don't even see any point in 
                         your changing hotels. Please help 
                         us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is 
                         counting on you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, if I'm going to die, I might 
                         as well do it for my country.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         That's the spirit.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh, stop it. What do you want me to 
                         do?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         We're anxious to know who this man 
                         is -- the one calling himself Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                         Maybe he really is Dyle. He could 
                         still be alive.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         No, Mrs. Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         But no one actually saw him die.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is 
                         registered with the War Department 
                         in Washington.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Then who's this one?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         I don't know -- but I think you'd 
                         better find out, don't you?

                                     REGGIE
                         Me? Why me?

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         You're in an ideal position -- he 
                         trusts you.
                              (grinning)
                         Besides, you said yourself, women 
                         make the best spies.

                                     REGGIE
                              (resigned)
                         Agents.

               EXT. HOTEL (PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS) -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment 
               later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. As she watches 
               DYLE, a SANDWICH-MAN advertising a driving school passes the 
               hotel. REGGIE falls in behind him, his tall placard hiding 
               her from view.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, 
               then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. The SANDWICH-MAN turns 
               off, leaving REGGIE out in the open. A moment later, DYLE 
               passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the 
               middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and 
               turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, 
               and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her 
               way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, 
               her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged 
               TOURIST.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

               The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, 
               looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and 
               she stares back. Finally, not knowing what else to do, she 
               smiles, then takes a portion of his brioche and eats it.

               He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her.

               REGGIE turns to look at DYLE.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND TOURIST

               The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he 
               opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, 
               rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused 
               TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some 
               money on the table and starts after her.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               REGGIE following DYLE. As she passes the GIRL painting, she 
               cannot resist turning to see the work.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PAINTING

               An abstract jumble, nothing recognizable.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she looks from the painting to reality.

               EXT. PLACE ST. ANDRÉ DES ARTS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As the scene really looks.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               She shrugs, continues after DYLE. Now we see that the TOURIST, 
               in turn, is following her.

                                     TOURIST
                              (calling)
                         Fraulein --

               REGGIE doesn't stop.

                                     TOURIST
                         Fraulein --

                                     REGGIE
                              (turning but continuing)
                         What are you doing, following me? 
                         Stop it -- we're going to look like 
                         a parade.

               She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then 
               continues after her.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to 
               cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He 
               turns back in REGGIE's direction.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she 
               turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with 
               him back toward the cafe.

                                     REGGIE
                              (smiling and rattling 
                              on)
                         How are you? When did you arrive in 
                         town? Are you enjoying Paris? It's 
                         lovely, isn't it? So many wonderful 
                         things to see and do, it makes one's 
                         head spin to think of it.

               She looks back over her shoulder and sees that DYLE is now 
               crossing the Rue Danton, heading for the platform of a bus 
               now stopped at the curb.

                                     TOURIST
                              (smiling)
                         Fraulein --

               REGGIE pulls away from him.

                                     REGGIE
                         If you don't stop following me I'll 
                         call the police.

               She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as 
               she starts after DYLE again.

               DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away.

               REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi.

                                     REGGIE
                         Taxi -- !

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE enters. CAMERA PANNING with him to the head of a stairway 
               leading downstairs, a sign indicating that it leads to the 
               "MAIL ROOM & TELEPHONES." CAMERA PANS back to the door as 
               REGGIE enters.

               DELETED

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS MAIL ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               DYLE walks to one of several windows. A sign over it reading:

                                         "A - D."

               MED. SHOT -- STAIRS

               REGGIE comes down the stairs. Suddenly she stops.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               CAMERA ZOOMS in to sign on "D."

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               A confused look on her face.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               As his turn comes, he addresses the CLERK

                                     DYLE
                         Dyle, please... D - Y - L - E.

                                     CLERK
                         Yes, Mr. Dyle. I remember.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Watching.

               MED. SHOT -- MAIL WINDOW

               The CLERK takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts 
               through it.

                                     CLERK
                         I'm sorry, Mr. Dyle -- nothing today.

                                     DYLE
                         Thanks -- see you soon.

               He turns and heads out, starting up the stairs where REGGIE 
               was but is no longer. As he reaches the fourth or fifth step, 
               a VOICE is heard over the loudspeaker.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Dyle, please -- you're wanted on 
                         the telephone -- Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4.

               DYLE stops in his tracks, pondering what to do.

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         Mr. Dyle. Cabin 4, please.

               He stops and comes down the stairs, going to the back of the 
               room and into the cabin marked "4."

                                     DYLE
                              (picking up the phone)
                         Yes?

               CAMERA DOLLIES across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in 
               the third one, on the phone.

               INT. REGGIE'S CABIN

               REGGIE on the phone. 

               INT. DYLE'S CABIN

               DYLE on the phone.

                                     REGGIE
                         Good morning, Mr. Dyle.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie?

                                     REGGIE
                         It's the only name I've got. How 
                         about you?

                                     DYLE
                         No cat and mouse -- you've got me. 
                         What do you want to know?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why you lied to me.

                                     DYLE
                         I had to -- for all I knew you could 
                         have been in on the whole thing.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you know now, so please tell 
                         me who you are.

                                     DYLE
                         But you know my name -- it's Dyle.

                                     REGGIE
                         Carson Dyle is dead.

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, he is. He was my brother.

                                     REGGIE
                         Your --

                                     DYLE
                         The army thinks he was killed in 
                         action by the Germans, but I think 
                         they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- 
                         and your husband -- because he 
                         wouldn't go along with their scheme 
                         to steal the gold. I think he 
                         threatened to turn them in and they 
                         killed him. I'm trying to prove it. 
                         They think I'm working with them. 
                         But I'm not, and that's the truth. 
                         I'm on your side, Reggie -- please 
                         believe that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can I? You lied to me -- the way 
                         Charles did -- and after promising 
                         you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe 
                         you, Peter... oh, but I can't call 
                         you that anymore, can I? It will 
                         take me a while to get used to your 
                         new name -- which I don't even know 
                         yet. What is it?
                              (pause)
                         Aren't you going to tell me?
                              (pause)
                         Hello -- ?

               She opens the door of the cabin and starts out.

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE CABINS

               As REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the 
               others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside 
               it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EMPTY CABIN

               The receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she looks at it, confused.

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- DAY

               DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, 
               SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (quietly)
                         If you do anything funny, or try to 
                         talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- 
                         here and now. Okay?

                                     DYLE
                         You'll wreck your raincoat.

               The self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS 
               come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in 
               after them.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Next car, please.

               He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal 
               hand. The doors close.

               DELETED

               INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks 
               around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. 
               He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, 
               which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, 
               leading up to a second floor.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Okay -- turn around.

               DYLE turns to find SCOBIE's gun out of the pocket and pointing 
               at him. SCOBIE now transfers it to his metal hand and goes 
               to DYLE, where he proceeds to frisk him.

               Finding the gun DYLE carries in his inside coat pocket, SCOBIE 
               removes it. During the following conversation he will shake 
               open the revolving magazine and let the bullets fall out 
               onto the floor before handing back the emptied gun to DYLE.  
               Then he will transfer his own gun back to his good hand.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Sit down.

               Shrugging, DYLE sits on the third step.

                                     DYLE
                         What now?

                                     SCOBIE
                         We wait -- with our mouths shut.

               INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- NIGHT

               The last EMPLOYEES leave the building as the WATCHMAN locks 
               the front door after them.

               INT. TOP FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               In the semi-darkness, DYLE is still sitting on the third 
               step, SCOBIE still facing him with a gun.

                                     DYLE
                         How long do you intend -- ?

                                     SCOBIE
                         I said with the mouth shut.

               DYLE yawns wide.

                                     DYLE
                         Sorry about that.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Okay -- up there.

               DYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by 
               SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door.

                                     DYLE
                         Do I knock or something?

                                     SCOBIE
                         Open it.

               DYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Keep going.

                                     DYLE
                         The view had better be worth it.

               EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS -- ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

               A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights 
               beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of 
               roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into 
               a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely 
               separated oval-shaped dormer windows.

               Below these is a rain gutter, then nothing -- for seven 
               stories.

                                     DYLE
                         Very pretty. Now what?

                                     SCOBIE
                         I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which 
                         is more than you'd give me. Where's 
                         the money?

                                     DYLE
                         Is that why you dragged me all the 
                         way up here -- to ask me that? She 
                         has it -- you know that.

                                     SCOBIE
                         And I say maybe you both have it! 
                         One more time, Dyle -- where is it?

                                     DYLE
                         Supposing I did have it -- which I 
                         don't -- do you really think I'd 
                         hand it over?

                                     SCOBIE
                         You're out, Dyle -- right now!

               SCOBIE aims the gun and starts advancing toward DYLE.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Step back.

               DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a 
               sheer drop to the street.

                                     DYLE
                         Back where?

                                     SCOBIE
                         That's the idea.

               Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand 
               with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof.

               Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the 
               jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around 
               DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears.

               Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, 
               unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of 
               the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE 
               suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold 
               is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his 
               back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound 
               extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder.

               Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and 
               leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple 
               with one another, each trying to break free and reach for 
               the gun.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THEIR HANDS

               Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE AND SCOBIE

               The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are 
               beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to 
               stop SCOBIE from crawling over him. He has the large man by 
               both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold 
               him. But SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, 
               continues to inch forward toward the gun.

               Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold. With nothing restraining 
               him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his 
               momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, 
               where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the the 
               slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip.

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE'S CLAW

               As it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching 
               sound and causing sparks to fly.

               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he slides over the edge and disappears.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DYLE

               As he watches, hypnotized.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROOF EDGE

               There appears to be no sign of SCOBIE. Then CAMERA ZOOMS IN 
               FOR A TIGHT CLOSE SHOT OF SCOBIE'S metal hand, gripping the 
               rain gutter at the very edge.

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               Having seen the claw, he rises and walks to the very edge of 
               the level part of the roof.

                                     DYLE
                         Herman?

               MED. SHOT -- SCOBIE

               As he hangs, seven stories over the street, by his metal 
               hand.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Yeah?

               MED. SHOT -- DYLE

               He finds it hard to believe.

                                     DYLE
                         How are you doing?

                                     SCOBIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         How do you think?

                                     DYLE
                         If you get bored, try writing 'Love 
                         thy neighbor' a hundred times on the 
                         side of the building.

               DYLE turns and leaves going down the stairs.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               The HOTEL MANAGER is busy taping a piece of cardboard over 
               the hole ripped in REGGIE's door by SCOBIE's metal hand the 
               night before. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own 
               door. The MANAGER eyes him coldly. DYLE "takes" the look.

                                     DYLE
                         I didn't do it.

                                     MANAGER
                         The next time madame forgets her 
                         key, there is another one at the 
                         desk.

               DYLE smiles, then enters his room.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               He closes the door and starts to remove his torn coat, 
               wincing.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE, smoking on the bed, sits up when she hears DYLE moving 
               about in his room. She goes to the connecting door, unlocks 
               her side, tries the knob, finds it still bolted from his 
               side and knocks.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is that you?

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE goes to the door, throws back the bolt and opens the 
               door. REGGIE enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Didn't anyone ever tell you it's 
                         impolite to --
                              (seeing his injured 
                              back)
                         What happened?

                                     DYLE
                         I met a man with sharp nails.

                                     REGGIE
                         Scobie?

                                     DYLE
                         I left him hanging around the American 
                         Express.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come on -- I've got something that 
                         stings like crazy.

               She leads him into her room.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room. She leads him to the 
               bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Take off your shirt and lie down.

               As REGGIE goes to the bathroom, DYLE takes off his torn shirt, 
               revealing a torn and bloody T-shirt. He lies face downwards 
               on the bed. REGGIE returns, carrying cotton, gauze, tape, 
               scissors, and disinfectant. She sits next to him and lifts 
               up his T-shirt to examine the wound.

                                     DYLE
                              (wincing)
                         Listen -- all I really want is an 
                         estimate.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's not so bad. You may not be able 
                         to lie on your back for a few days -- 
                         but, then, you can lie from any 
                         position, can't you?

               She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning 
               the wound. He winces.

                                     REGGIE
                         Does it hurt?

                                     DYLE
                         Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?

               She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging 
               it while they talk.

                                     REGGIE
                         Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?

                                     DYLE
                         Would you like to see my passport?

                                     REGGIE
                         Your passport! What kind of a proof 
                         is that?

                                     DYLE
                         Would you like to see where I was 
                         tattooed?

                                     REGGIE
                         Sure.

                                     DYLE
                         Okay, I'll drive you around there 
                         some day.
                              (his back stinging)
                         Ouch!

                                     REGGIE
                         Ha ha. You could at least tell me 
                         what your first name is these days.

                                     DYLE
                         Alexander.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Dyle?

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, but we're divorced.

                                     REGGIE
                         I thought that was Peter Joshua.

                                     DYLE
                              (smiling)
                         I'm no easier to live with than he 
                         was.

                                     REGGIE
                              (finishing the bandage)
                         There -- you're a new man.

               As they continue talking, he rises from the bed and goes 
               into his own room. REGGIE remains on the bed, watching him 
               through the open door as he puts on a fresh T-shirt and shirt.

                                     DYLE
                         I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the 
                         truth, but I had to find out your 
                         part in all this.

                                     REGGIE
                         Alex -- how can you tell if someone 
                         is lying or not?

                                     DYLE
                         You can't.

                                     REGGIE
                         There must be some way.

                                     DYLE
                         There's an old riddle about two tribes 
                         of Indians -- the Whitefeet always 
                         tell the truth and the Blackfeet 
                         always lie. So one day you meet an 
                         Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful 
                         Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He 
                         tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, 
                         but which one is he?

                                     REGGIE
                         Why couldn't you just look at his 
                         feet?

                                     DYLE
                         Because he's wearing moccasins.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. Well, then he's a truthful 
                         Whitefoot, of course.

                                     DYLE
                         Why not a lying Blackfoot?

                                     REGGIE
                              (confused)
                         Which one are you?

                                     DYLE
                              (entering, smiling)
                         Whitefoot, of course.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come here.

               He goes to the bed.

                                     REGGIE
                         Sit down.

               He sits.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope it turns out you're a 
                         Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very 
                         happy hanging around the tepee.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- listen to me --

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly 
                         talk. You forget I'm already a widow.

                                     DYLE
                         So was Juliet -- at fifteen.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm not fifteen.

                                     DYLE
                         Well, there's your trouble right 
                         there -- you're too old for me.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why can't you be serious?

                                     DYLE
                         There, you said it.

                                     REGGIE
                         Said what?

                                     DYLE
                         Serious. When a man gets to be my 
                         age that's the last word he ever 
                         wants to hear. I don't want to be 
                         serious -- and I especially don't 
                         want you to be.

                                     REGGIE
                         Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll 
                         just sit around all day long being 
                         frivolous -- how about that?

               She starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek.

                                     DYLE
                         Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pulling back)
                         Okay.

                                     DYLE
                         What are you doing?

                                     REGGIE
                         Cutting it out.

                                     DYLE
                         Who told you to do that?

                                     REGGIE
                         You did.

                                     DYLE
                         But I'm not through complaining yet.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh.
                              (She starts kissing 
                              him again)
                          

                                     DYLE
                         Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.

                                     REGGIE
                         I think I love you, Alex --

               She kisses him on the mouth. The phone rings. He tries to 
               talk as she continues kissing him.

                                     DYLE
                              (mumbling)
                         The phone's ringing --

                                     REGGIE
                         Whoever it is won't give up -- and 
                         neither will I.

               The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him.

               Finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the 
               phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths 
               and mumbles into it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on phone)
                         Sorry -- I was just -- uh -- nibbling 
                         on something.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               TEX speaks into the phone.

                                     TEX
                         Miz Lampert, my buddies 'n me, we'd 
                         oblige it mighty highly if you could 
                         mosey on across the hall 'n chew the 
                         fat with us for a spell.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE is watching her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Can you give me one good reason why 
                         I should?

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout 
                         seven or eight years old. Th' little 
                         tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- 
                         ain't that cute?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm.

                                     REGGIE
                         They've got Jean-Louis!

                                     DYLE
                         That sounds like their problem.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into the phone)
                         I'll be right there.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                         We'll be waitin' in room forty-seven, 
                         Miz Lampert -- so you just wiggle on 
                         over.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE hangs up.

                                     REGGIE
                         What day is it?

                                     DYLE
                         Tuesday.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie 
                         works late Tuesday nights -- she 
                         always leaves him with me. They 
                         wouldn't do anything to a little 
                         boy, would they?

                                     DYLE
                         I don't know -- it depends on whether 
                         or not they've already eaten.

               INT. TEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- JEAN-LOUIS. He looks around, uncertainly, first 
               one way, then the other. CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him sitting 
               on SCOBIE's knee, the large man holding him with his good 
               hand, the metal one in his pocket. TEX sits next to them 
               while GIDEON nervously paces the floor. When GIDEON begins 
               sneezing he takes the small bottle of pills from his pocket 
               and downs one or two, swallowing some water.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Hey, Tex -- move the kid to the other 
                         knee or something, will you? My leg's 
                         going to sleep.

               TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other 
               knee.

                                     TEX
                         Upsy-daisy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Are you a real cowboy?

                                     TEX
                         Sure am.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Then where is your gun?

                                     TEX
                              (taking out his gun)
                         Right here -- see?

                                     GIDEON
                         Will you put that thing away!

               A KNOCK at the door. GIDEON goes to open it. REGGIE and DYLE 
               enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               She snatches him off SCOBIE's lap.

                                     TEX
                         Howdy, Miz Lampert.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (glaring at DYLE)
                         Who invited you?

                                     DYLE
                         Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, 
                         I see.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'd better call Sylvie -- she must 
                         be frantic.

               She starts for the door with JEAN-LOUIS. GIDEON blocks her 
               way.

                                     GIDEON
                         I'm afraid that will have to wait, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                                     REGGIE
                         But his mother --

                                     GIDEON
                         She isn't going to be anybody's mother 
                         unless you answer some questions.

                         TEX
                 This ain't no game, 
                 Miz Lampert.

                                                       SCOBIE
                                               We want that money -- now!

                                     DYLE
                              (forcefully)
                         Be quiet, all of you!

               The THREE MEN look at him, surprised by his tone.

                                     DYLE
                         And stop threatening that boy. He 
                         doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert 
                         doesn't either.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Then who does?

                                     DYLE
                         I don't know, Herman -- maybe you 
                         do.

                                     SCOBIE
                         Me?

                                     DYLE
                              (to TEX)
                         Or you --
                              (to GIDEON)
                         Or you --

                                     GIDEON, TEX & SCOBIE
                              (together)
                         That's the most ridiculous -- !
                         You gone loco?
                         Listen to the man!

                                     DYLE
                         Slowly. Suppose one of you found 
                         Charles here in Paris, followed him, 
                         cornered him on the train, threw him 
                         out the window and took the money.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (after a pause)
                         That's a crock! If one of us did 
                         that he wouldn't hang around here 
                         waiting for the other two to wise 
                         up.

                                     DYLE
                         But he'd have to. If he left he'd be 
                         admitting his guilt -- and the others 
                         would know what happened. Whoever it 
                         is has to wait here, pretending to 
                         look for the money, waiting for the 
                         rest of us to give up and go home. 
                         That's when he'll be safe and not a 
                         minute before.

               A pause as the THREE MEN look at one another.

                                     GIDEON
                         Up till now we always figured she 
                         had the money -- but you know so 
                         much about it, maybe you've got it.

                                     DYLE
                         Then what am I doing here? You didn't 
                         know anything about me -- I'm the 
                         only one who could have taken it and 
                         kept right on going.

                                     SCOBIE
                         He's just tryin' to throw us off! 
                         They've got it, I tell you! Why don't 
                         we search their rooms?

                                     DYLE
                              (exchanging looks 
                              with REGGIE)
                         It's all right with us --

                                     TEX
                              (rising)
                         What are we wastin' time for? Let's 
                         go.

                                     DYLE
                         And while we're waiting, we might as 
                         well go through yours.

                                     SCOBIE
                              (stopping)
                         Not my room!

                                     DYLE
                         What's wrong, Herman -- have you got 
                         something to hide?
                              (a pause, then smiling)
                         Then I take it there are no 
                         objections.

               The THREE MEN look at one another unhappily.

                                     DYLE
                         We'd better exchange keys. Here's 
                         mine.

                                     SCOBIE
                         I'll take that.

               He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his. GIDEON goes to REGGIE, 
               takes her key and gives her his own.

                                     TEX
                         Mine's in the door. Ariva durchy, 
                         y'all.

               The THREE MEN file out. DYLE and REGGIE exchange looks.

                                     DYLE
                         Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets 
                         your vote?

                                     REGGIE
                         Scobie -- he's the one that objected.

                                     DYLE
                              (handing her the boy)
                         He's all yours. I'll do Tex and 
                         Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- 
                         and make sure you bolt the door from 
                         inside.

                                     REGGIE
                         Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to 
                         have a treasure hunt.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (joining them)
                         Oh, la! If I find the treasure, will 
                         I win a prize?

                                     REGGIE
                              (to DYLE)
                         What should we give him?

                                     DYLE
                         How about $25,000? Or do you think 
                         it would spoil him?

               She smiles, takes JEAN-LOUIS' hand and leaves. DYLE turns to 
               survey TEX's room.

               He goes first to the drawer in the night table -- empty; and 
               the bed, looking in it and under it. Then he goes to the 
               desk and opens the drawers -- also empty. The bureau is next -- 
               he opens all three double drawers and they, too, are 
               completely empty. Frowning, he goes to the armoire and opens 
               it -- shelves and hanging bar are likewise bare.

               Then, CAMERA PANNING DOWN, he sees the only thing he's found 
               so far in the room -- a pair of fine cowboy boots.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- AIRLINES BAG. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include 
               GIDEON, staring down at it as it lies on the table in the 
               center of the room.

                                     GIDEON
                              (eyes on the bag)
                         Tex?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including TEX, busy going through the bureau. He looks up, 
               then joins GIDEON.

                                     TEX
                         What's that?

               GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then 
               starts examining the various items. He opens the wallet.

               INSERT - WALLET

               Inside, the initials "C.L." are printed in gold.

                                     TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Charlie's stuff?

                                     GIDEON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Looks like it.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX & GIDEON

                         Mebbe we'd better call Herman.

               GIDEON has put the wallet aside and now picks up the letter, 
               removing it from the envelope and reading it.

                                     GIDEON
                         What for? If it's not here, why bother 
                         him?

                         Why bother him?

               A broad grin from TEX. They continue going through the items 
               from the bag.

                         No. The police have kindly provided 
                         us with a list.

               TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it 
               in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag.

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE on the phone, JEAN-LOUIS standing by.

                                     REGGIE
                         -- He's all right, Sylvie, honestly. 
                         Just hurry up and get here.

               She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS.

                                     REGGIE
                         Come on, now -- if you wanted to 
                         hide something, where would you put 
                         it?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         I know. I would bury it in the garden.

                                     REGGIE
                         Swell -- only this man doesn't have 
                         a garden.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Oh.
                              (Afterthought)
                         Neither do I.
                              (Seeing something)
                         Voilà!

                                     REGGIE
                         Voilà what?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (pointing)
                         Up there! I would put it up there!

               REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top 
               of the high armoire.

                                     REGGIE
                         You know something, cookie? Why not?

               Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands 
               on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, 
               by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand 
               over the top and grope around blindly.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope I don't find any little hairy 
                         things living up here -- wait! There 
                         is something! If I can just -- yes, 
                         I'm getting it -- a case of some 
                         sort -- it's heavy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (jumping up and down)
                         I found it! I found it!

                                     REGGIE
                         If you think you're getting credit 
                         for this, you're crazy.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (ecstatic)
                         We won! We won!

               REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a 
               rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone 
               case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs 
               to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING 
               with him.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - THIRD LANDING - NIGHT

               As JEAN-LOUIS runs out into the hall, shouting.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         We found it! We found it!

               DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room.

               TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         We found it!

               The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously 
               into SCOBIE's room.

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As DYLE, TEX and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little 
               straight black chair to its original position. There is no 
               sign of the black case.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- ? Did you find it?

                                     REGGIE
                         No.

                                     GIDEON
                         What do you mean, no?

                                     TEX
                         The kid said --

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                              (pointing atop the 
                              armoire)
                         Up there! It is up there!

                                     REGGIE
                         No, Jean-Louis.

               TEX grabs the chair and moves it to the armoire, climbing up 
               on it and grabbing the bag.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's nothing, I tell you!

               He brings it to the table as DYLE and GIDEON crowd around 
               him, anxious to see.

               CLOSE SHOTS (PANNING)

               The ring of faces, one at a time. TEX, his jaw muscles working 
               feverishly; DYLE, his eyes unblinking, a slight smile on his 
               lips; GIDEON, his mouth open greedily.

               GROUP SHOT

               As TEX finally springs the latches and opens the lid.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CASE

               Inside, neatly packed in velvet fittings, like the parts of 
               a musical instrument, are various portions of and attachments 
               for a metal artificial hand.

                                     TEX'S VOICE (O.S.)

               GROUP SHOT -- THE THREE MEN

               As they stare at the case, surprised and just a little 
               embarrassed. Slowly TEX lowers the lid. The MEN avoid looking 
               at one another.

               WIDER ANGLE

               Including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door.

                         Where is he?

               The MEN look at one another.

                                     TEX
                         Hey, that's right!

                                     DYLE
                              (already running)
                         He's in my room.

               The THREE MEN hurry past REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS and out of 
               the door.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         What is the matter?

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, followed by REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS 
               cross the hall to DYLE's room. DYLE turns the key which is 
               still in the door. He enters, followed by the others.

               INT. DYLE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               DYLE, TEX and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking 
               around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The 
               room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no 
               sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming 
               from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the 
               first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under 
               the door.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- you and the boy better 
                         wait here.

               INT. BATH -- NIGHT

               SCOBIE, still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his 
               head submerged in the filled tub, the water now pouring over 
               the edge. His face is distorted. DYLE's hand appears and 
               turns off the water.

                         The police aren't going to like this 
                         one bit.

                         down the hall to his own room.
                              (looking at the body)
                         He really doesn't look so bad.

                         always was strangers. Maybe now he'll 
                         meet up with his other hand someplace -- 
                         but I sure hope it ain't waitin' for

               INT. SCOBIE'S ROOM -- DAY

               CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE. The dead man's eyes are open, his jaw 
               hanging, his head lying crazily on the pillow.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to show him lying in bed, dressed in his 
               pajamas. CAMERA WHIRLS for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of a MAID, her 
               eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes 
               her. Then she screams.

               INT. GRANDPIERRE'S OFFICE -- LATE AFTERNOON

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. The policeman is apoplectic.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         No! No! No! No!

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include, REGGIE, DYLE, TEX and GIDEON, 
               all sitting silently in the INSPECTOR's office.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         A man drowned in his bed --

                         Dyle.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And yet you registered in Megeve as 
                         Mr. Joshua. Do you know it is against 
                         the law to register under an assumed 
                         name?

                                     DYLE
                         No, I didn't.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's done in America all the time.

               GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, 
               he looks into each face in turn.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         None of you will be permitted to 
                         leave Paris -- until this matter is 
                         cleared up. Only I warn you -- I 
                         will be watching. We use the 
                         guillotine in this country -- I have 
                         always suspected that the blade coming 
                         down causes no more than a slight 
                         tickling sensation on the back of 
                         the neck. It is only a guess, of 
                         course -- I hope none of you ever 
                         finds out for certain.

               EXT. QUAI MONTEBELLO -- LATE AFTERNOON (TRAVELING)

               REGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine, 
               CAMERA LEADING.

                                     REGGIE
                         Who do you think did it -- Gideon?

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe.

                                     REGGIE
                         Or Tex?

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're a big help. Can I have one of 
                         those?

               They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the 
               Pont au Double. DYLE shrugs.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to the VENDOR)
                         Vanille-chocolat.

               During the following, the VENDOR makes a double-decker cone 
               and hands it to REGGIE. DYLE pays and they resume their walk -- 
               all with no break in the dialogue.

                                     REGGIE
                         I think Tex did it.

                                     DYLE
                         Why?

                                     REGGIE
                         Because I really suspect Gideon -- 
                         and it is always the person you don't 
                         suspect.

                                     DYLE
                         Do women think it's feminine to be 
                         so illogical -- or can't they help 
                         it?

                                     REGGIE
                         What's so illogical about that?

                                     DYLE
                         A) It's always the person you don't 
                         suspect; B) that means you think 
                         it's Tex because you really suspect 
                         Gideon; therefore C) if you think 
                         it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- 
                         Gideon.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh. I guess they just can't help it.

                                     DYLE
                         Who?

                                     REGGIE
                         Women. You know, I can't help feeling 
                         rather sorry for Scobie.
                              (a pause)
                         Wouldn't it be nice if we were like 
                         that?

                                     DYLE
                         What -- like Scobie?

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way 
                         he danced down there next to the 
                         river in 'American in Paris' -- 
                         without a care in the world? This is 
                         good, want some?

               She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough 
               force to dislodge the ice-cream. It lands right next to his 
               lapel, over his outside breast pocket.

                                     DYLE
                              (frowning)
                         I'd love some, thanks.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry.

               He pulls open the pocket with two sticky fingers and looks 
               inside, then shakes his head sadly at what he sees. REGGIE 
               still holds the empty cone, not knowing what to do with it.

               Seeing this, he takes it and sticks it into his pocket.

                                     DYLE
                         No sense messing up the streets.

                                     REGGIE
                         Alex --

                                     DYLE
                         Hm?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm scared.

                                     DYLE
                         Don't worry, I'm not going to hit 
                         you.

                                     REGGIE
                         No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't 
                         think of any reason why he was killed.

               They resume walking.

                                     DYLE
                         Maybe somebody felt that four shares 
                         were too many --

                                     REGGIE
                         What makes you think that this 
                         somebody will be satisfied with three? 
                         He wants it all, Alex -- that means 
                         we're in his way, too.

                                     DYLE
                         Yes, I know.

                                     REGGIE
                         First your brother, then Charles, 
                         now Scobie -- we've got to do 
                         something! Any minute now we could 
                         be assassinated! Would you do anything 
                         like that?

                                     DYLE
                              (surprised)
                         What? Assassinate somebody?

                                     REGGIE
                         No --

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including the Cathedral of NOTRE DAME in the background.

                         -- swing down from there on a rope 
                         to save the woman you love -- like 
                         Charles Laughton in 'The Hunchback 
                         of Notre Dame'?

                         Let me know what you want -- I'll 
                         pick a suit that matches.

               He goes into his room and she goes into hers.

               She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the 
               door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries 
               to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks.

                         I wouldn't want to use that tub. 
                         Besides, I don't want to be alone.

                         happens, holler.

               He sits down to take off his shoes, but is interrupted by 
               the sound of REGGIE screaming. He races for the connecting 
               door, pulls back the bolt and rushes in.

                         Did you ever hear the story of the 
                         boy who cried wolf?

                         The shower's in there.

               He goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked 
               as well. She smiles at him.

                                     DYLE

                         Reggie -- open the door.

                                     REGGIE
                         This is a ludicrous situation. There 
                         must be dozens of men dying to use 
                         my shower.

                                     DYLE
                         Then I suggest you call one of them.

                                     REGGIE
                         I dare you.

               DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his 
               shoes.

                                     REGGIE

                              far?)
                         What are you doing?

                                     DYLE
                         Have you ever heard of anyone taking 
                         a shower with his shoes on?
                              (to himself)
                         What a nut.

               Shoes off, DYLE starts for the bathroom, humming.

                         I usually sing a medley of old 
                         favorites when I bathe -- any 
                         requests?

                         I don't think I know that one.

               Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully 
               dressed. REGGIE can't believe her eyes. She goes to the open 
               door for a closer look.

                                     DYLE
                              (explaining pleasantly)
                         Drip-dry!

               He takes the soap and begins washing as if he were washing 
               himself without the suit.

                                     DYLE
                         The suit needs it more than I do, 
                         anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         How often do you go through this 
                         little ritual?

               As he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it.

                                     DYLE
                         Every day. The manufacturer recommends 
                         it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't believe it.

               He opens his coat and reads a label inside.

                                     DYLE
                         "Wearing this suit during washing 
                         will help protect its shape."

               He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-
               brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his 
               wrist so she can see the watch.

                                     DYLE
                         Waterproof.

               He begins unbuttoning his suit. She turns and leaves, slamming 
               the door after her.

               DELETED

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               As REGGIE goes to the armoire to select a dress. The PHONE 
               rings and she answers it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (into phone)
                         Yes -- ?

               CLOSE SHOT -- BARTHOLOMEW

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (on the phone)
                         Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've 
                         spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm 
                         listening.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (on the phone)
                         I told them what you said -- about 
                         this man being Carson Dyle's brother. 
                         I asked them what they knew about it 
                         and they told me -- you're not gonna 
                         like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told 
                         me Carson Dyle has no brother.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has 
               been pulled out from under her.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pause, quietly)
                         Are you sure there's no mistake?

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- LATE AFTERNOON

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                              (on the phone)
                         None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         be careful.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               REGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried 
               expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and 
               DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. Her back is to 
               him.

                                     DYLE
                         I left all my drip-dry dripping -- 
                         is it all right?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- is something wrong?

               She shakes her head.

                                     DYLE
                         You're probably weak from hunger. 
                         You've only had five meals today. 
                         Hurry up and we'll go out.

               She turns and looks at him.

                                     REGGIE
                         Do you mind if we go someplace 
                         crowded? I -- I feel like lots of 
                         people tonight.

               EXT. SEINE - BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- DUSK

               The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze 
               with lights.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND DYLE (PROCESS)

               At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in 
               the b.g.

                                     DYLE
                         Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word 
                         in twenty minutes.

                                     REGGIE
                         I keep thinking about Charles and 
                         Scobie -- and the one who's going to 
                         be next -- me?

                                     DYLE
                         Nothing's going to happen to you 
                         while I'm around -- I want you to 
                         believe that.

                                     REGGIE
                         How can I believe it when you don't 
                         even know who the killer is? I've 
                         got that right, haven't I? You don't 
                         know who did it.

                                     DYLE
                         No -- not yet.

                                     REGGIE
                         But then if we sit back and wait, 
                         the field should start narrowing 
                         down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left 
                         alive at the end will pretty well 
                         have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't 
                         you say so?

                                     DYLE
                         Are you trying to say that I might 
                         have killed Charles and Scobie?

               She doesn't answer.

                                     DYLE
                         What do I have to do to satisfy you -- 
                         become the next victim?

                                     REGGIE
                         It's a start, anyway.

                                     DYLE
                         I don't understand you at all -- one 
                         minute you're chasing me around the 
                         shower room and the next you're 
                         accusing me of murder.

                                     REGGIE
                         Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.

               WIDER ANGLE

               She rises from the table and walks away. DYLE hesitates a 
               moment, then follows.

                                     DYLE
                         I can explain if you'll just listen. 
                         Will you listen?

                                     REGGIE
                              (looking at the river)
                         I can't very well leave without a 
                         pair of water wings.

                                     DYLE
                         Okay. Then get set for the story of 
                         my life -- not that it would ever 
                         make the best-seller list.

                                     REGGIE
                         Fiction or non-fiction?

                                     DYLE
                         Why don't you shut up!

                                     REGGIE
                         Well!

                                     DYLE
                         Are you going to listen?

                                     REGGIE
                         Go on.

                                     DYLE
                         After I graduated college I was all 
                         set to go into my father business. 
                         Umbrella frames -- that's what he 
                         made. It was a sensible business, I 
                         suppose, but I didn't have the sense 
                         to be interested in anything sensible.

                                     REGGIE
                         I suppose all this is leading 
                         somewhere?

                                     DYLE
                         It led me away from umbrella frames, 
                         for one thing. But that left me 
                         without any honest means of support.

                                     REGGIE
                         What do you mean?

                                     DYLE
                         When a man has no profession except 
                         the one he loathes, what's left? I 
                         began looking for people with more 
                         money than they'd ever need -- 
                         including some they'd barely miss.

                                     REGGIE
                              (astonished)
                         You mean, you're a thief?

                                     DYLE
                         Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd 
                         have chosen, but I suppose it captures 
                         the spirit of the thing.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't believe it.

                                     DYLE
                         Well, I can't really blame you -- 
                         not now.

                                     REGGIE
                         But I do believe it -- that's what I 
                         don't believe. So it's goodbye 
                         Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter 
                         Joshua.

                                     DYLE
                         Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you 
                         realize you've had three names in 
                         the past two days? I don't even know 
                         who I'm talking to any more.

                                     DYLE
                              (now called ADAM)
                         The man's the same, even if the name 
                         isn't.

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- he's not the same. Alexander 
                         Dyle was interested in clearing up 
                         his brother's death. Adam Canfield 
                         is a crook. And with all the 
                         advantages you've got -- brains, 
                         charm, education, a handsome face --

                                     ADAM
                         Oh, come on!

                                     REGGIE
                         -- there has to be a darn good reason 
                         for living the way you do. I want to 
                         know what it is.

                                     ADAM
                         It's simple. I like what I do -- I 
                         enjoy doing it. There aren't many 
                         men who love their work as much as I 
                         do. Look around some time.

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Canfield?

                                     ADAM
                         Yes, but --

                                     ADAM AND REGGIE
                              (together)
                         -- we're divorced.

                                     ADAM
                         Right. Now go eat your dinner.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting 
               food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side.

                                     REGGIE
                              (miserably)
                         I could eat a horse.

                                     ADAM
                              (looking at all the 
                              food)
                         I think that's what you ordered.

                                     REGGIE
                         Don't you dare to be civil with me!  
                         All this time you were leading me on --

                                     ADAM
                         How was I leading you on?

                                     REGGIE
                         All that marvelous rejection -- you 
                         knew I couldn't resist it. Now it 
                         turns out you were only interested 
                         in the money.

                                     ADAM
                         That's right.

                                     REGGIE (HURT)
                         Oh!

                                     ADAM
                         What would you like me to say -- 
                         that a pretty girl with an outrageous 
                         manner means more to an old pro like 
                         me than a quarter of a million 
                         dollars?

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- I guess not.

                                     ADAM
                         It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.

                                     REGGIE
                         What?

                                     ADAM
                         Don't you know I'm having a tough 
                         time keeping my eyes off of you?

               REGGIE reacts in surprise.

                                     ADAM
                         Oh, you should see your face.

                                     REGGIE
                         What about it?

                                     ADAM
                              (taking her hand, 
                              nicely)
                         It's lovely.

               She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate 
               away.

                                     ADAM
                         What's the matter?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?

               The lights go out.

                                     REGGIE
                              (alarmed)
                         Adam!

                                     ADAM
                         It's all right -- look.

               EXT. SEINE BÂTEAU MOUCHE -- NIGHT

               A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now 
               begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's 
               edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly 
               and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of 
               mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and 
               some (the most intimate) damn annoyed. One even shakes his 
               fist at the light.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together 
               at the rail watching.

                                     REGGIE
                         You don't look so bad in this light.

                                     ADAM
                         Why do you think I brought you here?

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating the lovers)
                         I thought maybe you wanted me to see 
                         the kind of work the competition was 
                         turning out.

                                     ADAM
                         Pretty good, huh? I taught them 
                         everything they do.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh? Did they do that sort of thing 
                         way back in your day?

                                     ADAM
                         How do you think I got here?

               She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction 
               is to look at her.

                                     REGGIE
                         Aren't you allowed to kiss back?

                                     ADAM
                         No. The doctor said it would be bad 
                         for my -- thermostat.

               She kisses him again. He responds a little better.

                                     ADAM
                         When you come on, you really come 
                         on.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- come on.

               She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her.

                                     REGGIE
                         I know why you're not taken -- no 
                         one can catch up with you.

                                     ADAM
                         Relax -- you're gaining.

               DELETED

               INT. GIDEON'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- GIDEON. As he sits bolt upright in bed, startled.

               The room is dark and the phone is ringing. He switches on 
               the lamp, looks at the clock (it reads 3:30) and shakes his 
               head before picking up the receiver.

                                     GIDEON
                         Huh? You must be crazy -- it's three-
                         thirty in the morning -- you mean 
                         now?  -- all right -- I'll be down 
                         in a minute.

               He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his 
               slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he 
               shuffles sleepily to the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               As GIDEON comes out of his room and goes to the elevator.

               The cage is there. He opens the door and enters.

               INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT

               GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The 
               cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the 
               elevator stops between floors and the lights go out.

                                     GIDEON
                         Hey! Turn on the lights!

               Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts 
               moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back, 
               whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past 
               it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator, 
               GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level 
               and keeps right on going, toward the basement.

                                     GIDEON
                         Hey! How do you stop this thing?

               The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is 
               a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes 
               that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely 
               awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking 
               horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He 
               presses the call button and the motor starts.

               An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER 
               opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES 
               PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor 
               of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a 
               puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no 
               strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Three of them -- all in their pajamas! 
                         C'est ridicule! What is it, some new 
                         American fad?

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their 
               bathrobes.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And now your friend -- the one from 
                         Texas -- he has disappeared -- checked 
                         out -- pouf! into thin air! Where is 
                         he?

                                     ADAM
                         I don't know.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Madame?

               REGGIE shrugs.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Tell me, Mr. Dyle -- where were you 
                         at three-thirty?

                                     ADAM
                         In my room, asleep.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And you, Mrs. Lampert?

                                     REGGIE
                         I was, too.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         In Mr. Dyle's room?

                                     REGGIE
                              (bitterly)
                         No -- in my room.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                              (pause, lighting cigar)
                         It stands to reason you are telling 
                         the truth -- for why would you invent 
                         such a ridiculous story?

               REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         And if I were you, I would not stay 
                         in my pajamas. Good night.

               GRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the 
               hall toward their own rooms.

                                     ADAM
                         That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. 
                         Go back to bed -- I'll let you know 
                         when I've found him.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're going to look for him -- now?

                                     ADAM
                         If the police find him first they're 
                         not very likely to turn over a quarter 
                         of a million dollars to us, are they?

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam --

                                     ADAM
                         There's no time -- I'll call you in 
                         the morning.

               ADAM disappears into his own room.

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters, going to the closet to remove his suit.

               The phone rings. He answers it.

                                     ADAM
                         Yes?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX. As he speaks on the phone.

                                     TEX
                         Now Dyle, you listen to me -- my 
                         mama didn't raise no stupid children. 
                         I know who's got the money 'n I ain't 
                         disappearing till I got my share -- 
                         'n' my share's growin' a whole lot 
                         bigger ev'ry day.

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     ADAM
                              (on the phone)
                         Where are you, ol' buddy?

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     TEX
                              (on the phone)
                              (laughs)
                         I'll tell you what, fella -- you 
                         want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round --
                         from now on I'll be right behind 
                         you.
                              (hangs up)

               INT. ADAM'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks 
               behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts 
               for REGGIE's door.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting 
               door.

                                     REGGIE
                         What is it?

                                     ADAM
                         Open up.

               She undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters.

                                     ADAM
                         I think we were wrong about Tex having 
                         the money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Why?

                                     ADAM
                         I just heard from him -- he's still 
                         hungry. That means killing Gideon 
                         didn't get it for him -- so he's 
                         narrowed it down to us. You've got 
                         it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --

                                     ADAM
                         Where's that airlines bag?

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, you're stubborn.

                                     ADAM
                         I sure am. Get it.

               She goes to the closet and gets the bag.

                                     ADAM
                         Charles must have had the money with 
                         him on the train, and Tex missed it.

               He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents.

                                     REGGIE
                         But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's 
                         been through that bag. Somebody would 
                         have seen it.

                                     ADAM
                         Let's look anyway.

                                     REGGIE
                         Lord, you're stubborn.

                                     ADAM
                         I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only 
                         we could see it. We're looking at it 
                         right now.

                         Something on that bed is worth a 
                         quarter of a million dollars.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Yes, but what?

                                     ADAM'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I don't know -- I just don't know.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

               As ADAM begins to examine the items one by one.

                                     ADAM
                         Electric razor -- comb -- steamship 
                         ticket -- fountain pen -- four 
                         passports -- toothbrush -- wallet --
                              (He goes through the 
                              wallet, finds nothing)
                         key -- what about that?

                                     REGGIE
                         To the apartment -- it matches mine 
                         perfectly.

                                     ADAM
                         The letter --

               He takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses 
               before reading it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'll bet you don't really need those.

               He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.

                                     REGGIE
                         You need them.
                              (She hands them back)
                          

                                     ADAM
                              (reading the letter)
                         It still doesn't make sense, but it 
                         isn't worth any quarter of a million 
                         either. Have we forgotten anything?

                                     REGGIE
                         The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- 
                         could you recognize heroin just by 
                         tasting it?

               He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it. REGGIE 
               watches expectantly.

                                     ADAM
                         Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.

                                     ADAM
                         Go to bed. You've got to be at work 
                         in the morning. There's nothing more 
                         we can do tonight.

                                     REGGIE
                              (pause)
                         I love you, Adam.

                                     ADAM
                         Yes, you told me.

                                     REGGIE
                         No -- last time I said "I love you, 
                         Alex."

               The ultra-modern glass and concrete structure behind the 
               Ecole Militaire.

               INT. UNESCO CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               SEVERAL DELEGATES identified by little plaques in front of 
               them listing their respective nations, and their AIDES, sit 
               around the large table. They are all wearing earphones.

               The ITALIAN DELEGATE is speaking.

                                     ITALIAN DELEGATE
                         -- di conseguenza, il Governo Italiano 
                         è decisamente a favore per 
                         l'incoraggiamento, in accordo con le 
                         tradizioni etniche rispettive delle 
                         culture basilari dei passi in via di 
                         sviluppo. Per esempio, pregare i 
                         Vietnamiti di aggiungere alle loro 
                         risaie ed ai loro campi di soja 
                         tradizionali una raccolta di semola, 
                         non solo sconvolgerebbe le loro 
                         secolari tradizioni ma, oltre tutto, 
                         e questo è molto importante per il 
                         Governo che io ho l'onore di 
                         rappresentare disturberebbe 
                         l'esportazione delle derrate farinose 
                         italiane in questa parte del mondo. 
                         Signori Delegati vi ringrazio della 
                         vostra attenzione.

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               REGGIE, wearing her headset, is talking with SYLVIE.

                                     REGGIE
                         I hope Jean-Louis understands about 
                         last night -- it's just not safe for 
                         him to be around me right now.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Don't be silly -- he would not do 
                         anything. He is not yet old enough 
                         to be interested in girls. He says 
                         collecting stamps is much more 
                         satisfying to a man of his age.

                                     REGGIE
                         Hold it -- Italy just finished. 
                         They're recognizing Great Britain.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Oh la vache!

               SYLVIE jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting 
               the door after her.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               The BRITISH DELEGATE rises to speak, continuing through the 
               next scene.

                                     BRITISH DELEGATE
                         Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my 
                         distinguished colleague from Italy. 
                         Her Majesty's delegation has listened 
                         with great patience to the Southern 
                         European position on this problem, 
                         and while we find it charmingly 
                         stated, we cannot possibly agree 
                         with its content. In 1937, in the 
                         British colonies of Kenya, Uganda 
                         and Tanganyika -- and, if I'm not 
                         mistaken, more or less in Somaliland -- 
                         a programme of crop rotation was 
                         instituted vis-à-vis arable land 
                         which had never before known the 
                         plough, beginning before the soil 
                         was able to know the sort of fatigue 
                         now plaguing most of Western Europe. 
                         In 1937, therefore, Her Majesty's 
                         Government -- at that time His 
                         Majesty's Government -- was able to 
                         properly assay the situation. We 
                         therefore oppose the resolution.

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               The door from the hall opens and ADAM enters.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- I think I've found --
                              (stopping)
                         are you on?

                                     REGGIE
                         No, it's all right. What's wrong, 
                         Adam?

                                     ADAM
                         Nothing's wrong. I think I found 
                         something. I was snooping around 
                         Tex's room and I found this in the 
                         waste basket. I've stuck it back 
                         together.

               He hands her a paper.

               INSERT -- POLICE RECEIPT

               The one GRANDPIERRE gave REGGIE. It has been torn in half 
               and scotch-taped back together.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         It's the receipt Inspector Grandpierre 
                         gave me -- for Charles's things. I 
                         don't see how that's going to --

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

                                     ADAM
                         You didn't look. Last night, when we 
                         went through the airlines bag, 
                         something was missing. See -- ?
                              (showing her the list)
                         "One agenda." It wasn't there.

                                     REGGIE
                         You're right. I remember Grandpierre 
                         looking through it. But there was 
                         nothing in it -- at least, nothing 
                         that the police thought was very 
                         important.

                                     ADAM
                         Can you remember anything at all?

                                     REGGIE
                         Grandpierre asked me about an 
                         appointment Charles had -- on the 
                         day he was killed.

                                     ADAM
                         With whom? Where?

                                     REGGIE
                         I think it only said where -- but I 
                         can't --

                                     ADAM
                         Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- 
                         it may be what we're looking for.

                                     REGGIE
                         That money's not ours, Adam -- if we 
                         keep it, we'll be breaking the law.

                                     ADAM
                         Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's 
                         no law against stealing stolen money.

                                     REGGIE
                         Of course there is!

                                     ADAM
                         There is? Well, I can't say I think 
                         very much of a silly law like that. 
                         Think, Reggie -- please think -- 
                         what was written in Charles' notebook?

                                     REGGIE
                         Well -- it was a place -- a street 
                         corner, I think. But I don't --
                              (hearing something 
                              through her earpiece)
                         Hold it. I'm on.

               She turns back to the conference, flips a switch and starts 
               speaking into her headset.

                         Mr. Chairman, fellow delegates -- my

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               The FRENCH DELEGATE is speaking.

                                     FRENCH DELEGATE
                         Monsieur le Président, Messieurs les 
                         délégués -- mon distingué collègue 
                         de la Grande Bretagne -- le problème 
                         vu par mon Gouvernement n'est pas 
                         aussi simple que nos amis les Anglais 
                         voudraient nous le faire croire. 
                         Mais leur pays n'est pas, après tout, 
                         un pays agricole, n'est-ce pas? La 
                         position française, ainsi que nous 
                         l'avons soulignée dans le rapport 
                         numéro trente-neuf bar oblique

                         lieu le 22 mars --

               INT. REGGIE'S BOOTH -- DAY

               REGGIE is busy translating.

                                     REGGIE
                         as outlined in report number three-
                         nine-stroke-five-two of the Western 
                         Hemisphere Conference held on March

                              (she stops)
                         no wait! It was last Thursday, five 
                         o'clock at the Jardin des Champs-
                         Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The 
                         garden!

                                     ADAM
                         It's Thursday today -- and it's almost 
                         five -- come on!

               By the locked gate.

                                     REGGIE
                         Now what?

                                     ADAM
                         Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- 
                         it's got to be something around here.

                                     REGGIE
                         But Charles' appointment was last 
                         week, not --

                                     ADAM
                         I know, but this is all we've got 
                         left.

                                     REGGIE
                         Well, you're right there. Ten minutes 
                         ago I had a job.

                                     ADAM
                         Stop grousing. If we find the money 
                         I'll buy you an international 
                         conference all your own. Now start 
                         looking. You take this side and I'll 
                         poke around over there.

               VARIOUS SHOTS -- WHAT THEY SEE

               A quick succession of shots showing:

               1. Children's Merry-go-round 2. Rond Point de Champs-Elysées 
               with fountains playing 3. Children's swings 4. Restaurant 
               Laurent 5. Balloon salesman

               EXT. FOUNTAIN -- LATE AFTERNOON

               ADAM stands by the large fountain, staring off at something 
               as REGGIE joins him.

                                     REGGIE
                         It's hopeless -- I don't even know 
                         what we're looking for.

                                     ADAM
                         It's all right -- I don't think Tex 
                         does, either.

                                     REGGIE
                         Tex? You mean he's here, too?

                                     ADAM
                         Look.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               He stands near the merry-go-round, looking at something in 
               his hand: Charles' agenda. Now he closes it and moves off, 
               disappearing behind a hedge.

               TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND ADAM

                                     ADAM
                         I'd better see what he's up to.  
                         Stay here -- I won't be long.

               ADAM starts off.

                                     REGGIE
                              (concerned)
                         Be careful, Adam -- please. He's 
                         already killed three men.

               DELETED

               EXT. RUE GABRIEL -- LATE AFTERNOON

               Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden 
               booths have been set up. They have collected quite a CROWD. 
               Into this area comes TEX, followed at a safe distance by 
               ADAM. Suddenly TEX stops.

               DELETED

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

               As he stares wide-eyed at something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- STAMPS

               Neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

               As he wheels to look at another booth.

               CLOSE SHOT -- MORE STAMPS

               In another arrangement.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TEX

               He turns crazily to look at another booth, then another.

               CLOSE SHOT -- EVEN MORE STAMPS

               Various FLASH SHOTS of stamps of all sizes, shapes and colors.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               As he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into 
               ADAM. TEX is startled.

                                     TEX
                         Sorry, fella --

               He rushes off past ADAM, who watches him for a moment, 
               confused, then turns toward the booth, not yet having seen 
               the stamps.

               MED. SHOT -- BOOTH

               From ADAM's angle. There are one or two persons standing at 
               the booth. CAMERA ZOOMS in on the display of stamps.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ADAM

                                     ADAM
                              (amazed)
                         The letter.

               He quickly turns to find TEX.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               As he hops into the back of a TAXI and it pulls away from 
               the curb. ADAM runs toward another TAXI.

                                     ADAM
                         Taxi! -- Taxi!

               As ADAM comes up the stairs and goes to REGGIE's door.

               Whipping out his gun, he flings open the door.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON

               From ADAM's angle. TEX sits in the armchair, staring at 
               CAMERA. Next to him is the airlines bag, its contents dumped 
               on the floor.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including ADAM as he enters, his gun trained on TEX. Without 
               speaking he goes to the airlines bag, then stoops down to go 
               through the spilled contents, keeping one eye all the time 
               on TEX. But he can't find what he's looking for.

                                     ADAM
                              (quietly)
                         All right -- where's the letter?

                                     TEX
                         The letter? The letter ain't worth 
                         nuthin'.

                                     ADAM
                         You know what I mean -- the envelope 
                         with the stamps. I want it.

                                     TEX
                              (a pause, then 
                              beginning to laugh)
                         You greenhorn -- you half-witted, 
                         thick-skulled, hare-brained, 
                         greenhorn! They wuz both too smart

                         What are you talking about?

                         First her husband, now her -- she 
                         hoodwinked you! She batted all them 
                         big eyes and you went 'n fell for it - 
                         like a egg from a tall chicken!

                         You want? Here -- it's yours!

               ADAM takes it and looks at it.

               INSERT -- ENVELOPE

               The corner containing the stamps is missing, torn off.

                         Look at you! Horn-swoggled by a purty 
                         face 'n all them sweet words! You

               REGGIE is looking around for ADAM. She sees something across 
               the street. CAMERA SPINS AROUND to discover SYLVIE, sitting 
               alone on a bench near the stamp market, reading a newspaper.

                         Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for 
                         Jean-Louis.

                                     SYLVIE
                         He was so excited -- when he got the 
                         stamps you gave him this morning. He 
                         said he had never seen any like them.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm glad. But what's all this?

                         Sylvie -- we've got to find him!

                         What's the matter, chérie?

                         Those stamps -- they're worth a 
                         fortune!

                         We will separate -- you look over 
                         there.

               They go off in opposite directions.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               But it isn't.

               MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

               Looking everywhere. Suddenly she sees something.

               CLOSE SHOT -- GROUP OF MEN -- THEIR LEGS

               Only a small boy's elbow and part of his arm show, the rest 
               hidden by all the legs.

               MED. SHOT -- SYLVIE

               She recognizes him from these fragments.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Jean-Louis!

               She rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands 
               looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Jean-Louis -- les timbrés -- où sont-
                         ils?

               Smiling, JEAN-LOUIS holds up an enormous sack of assorted 
               stamps -- hundreds of them.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Oh, zut!
                              (calling)
                         Reggie -- Reggie -- !

               REGGIE runs up and joins them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you 
                         have -- !
                              (spotting the sack of 
                              stamps)
                         What's that?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         A man traded with me -- all those 
                         for only four.

                                     REGGIE
                         Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where?

               JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying 
               to remember.

                                     SYLVIE
                         Vite, mon ange -- vite!

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Là bas -- Monsieur Félix.

               They all run off down the line of booths. JEAN-LOUIS stops 
               and points off.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Il est là!

               MED. SHOT -- STAMP BOOTH

               Closed, deserted, empty.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         But he is gone.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do 
                         you know where this Monsieur Félix 
                         lives?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         No -- but I will ask.

               He goes to the closest booth and shakes the coat sleeve of 
               the proprietor.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Monsieur Théophile --

                                     THÉOPHILE
                         Oui, jeune homme?

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Monsieur Félix, où habite-il?

                                     THÉOPHILE
                         A Montmartre -- demande à Monsieur 
                         August au Bar des Artistes -- Place 
                         Blanche.

                                     JEAN-LOUIS
                         Merci, Monsieur Théophile.
                              (returning to REGGIE 
                              and SYLVIE)
                         He says to ask Monsieur August at 
                         the --

               Before he can finish, SYLVIE, who has heard THÉOPHILE, has 
               JEAN-LOUIS by the hand, dragging him off at full speed, REGGIE 
               right alongside.

               DELETED

               INT. FÉLIX'S ROOM -- DUSK

               A bare, unkempt little room. FÉLIX, a man in his sixties, 
               sits at a table, smoking a pipe. There are stamps and albums 
               everywhere. He holds a magnifying glass in his hand, busy 
               studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks 
               up. Another KNOCK.

                                     FÉLIX
                         Entrez.

               The door opens and REGGIE, followed by SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, 
               enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Monsieur Félix -- ?

                                     FÉLIX
                              (without looking up)
                         I was expecting you. You are American 
                         too, of course.

                                     REGGIE
                              (looking at SYLVIE)
                         Yes.

                                     FÉLIX
                         The man who bought them last week 
                         was American. I did not see him but 
                         I heard. I knew you would come.

               He gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE 
               and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps.

                                     FÉLIX
                         Look at them, Madame.

               INSERT -- STAMPS

               Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still 
               attached to the portion of the torn envelope.

                                     FÉLIX (O.S.)
                         Have you ever, in your entire life, 
                         seen anything so beautiful?

                MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, FÉLIX, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know 
                         anything about stamps.

                                     FÉLIX
                         I know them as one knows his own 
                         face, even though I have never seen 
                         them. This yellow one -- a Swedish 
                         four shilling -- called 'De Gula 
                         Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.

                         How much is it worth?

                                     FÉLIX
                         The money is unimportant.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm afraid it is important.

                         Do you mind if I sit down?
                              (she sits)
                         What about the blue one?

                         It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and 
                         there are only seven left. In 1894 
                         the owner of one was murdered by a 
                         rival collector who was obsessed to 
                         own it.

                         d'oeuvre de la collection. The 
                         masterpiece. It is the most valuable 
                         stamp in the world. It is called 
                         'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed 
                         by hand on colored paper in 1852 and 
                         marked with the initials of the 
                         printer.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD FLOOR LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes hurrying up the stairs. She goes first to 
               ADAM's room and knocks.

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam? Adam? It's me, Reggie -- !

               There is no answer. She goes to her own door and, to her 
               surprise, finds it an inch or two ajar.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE enters. She freezes, having seen something on the 
               floor.

               MED. SHOT -- TEX

               His dead body lies on the floor, the wrists of his extended 
               arms tied to the leg of the bed, his ankles to the steam 
               radiator. And tied around his head is a plastic, transparent 
               bag, inside of which the suffocated man's face, the eyes 
               bulging against the plastic clinging tight to his features, 
               can be seen all too clearly. REGGIE enters the shot, bending 
               down to see if he's alive. Then she sees something beside 
               his hands near the leg of the bed.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARPET

               With his dying effort, TEX has traced a name against the 
               grain of the maroon carpet -- 'DYLE.'

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

               Astonished and horrified.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               BARTHOLOMEW, his face lathered for a shaving, is on the phone.

                                     BARTHOLOMEW
                         Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd 
                         better give that to me slowly. Who's 
                         Adam?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- 
                         of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the 
                         word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the 
                         murderer I tell you -- he's the only 
                         one left! You've got to do something!

                         Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. 
                         Does he have the money?

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         No, I do -- it was the stamps on 
                         that letter Charles had with him on 
                         the train. They were in plain sight 
                         all the time, but no one ever bothered 
                         looking at the envelope.

                              (on the phone)
                         The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. 
                         Lampert, listen to me -- you're not 
                         safe as long as you've got these 
                         stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- 
                         wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- 
                         it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do 
                         you know the center garden at the 
                         Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- 
                         as soon as you can get there. Hurry, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

               INT. REGGIE'S ROOM -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.

               She hangs up, looks briefly at TEX's body, shudders, then 
               hurries to the door.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- THIRD LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE leaves her room and goes to the elevator. She 
               presses the button, then notices it is in use. She goes to 
               the stairs and starts down.

               INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE -- NIGHT

               Between the landings. The stairs curve around the open 
               elevator shaft. As REGGIE comes down the stairs, the cage 
               rises into view. Inside is ADAM. For a moment, she stops and 
               their eyes meet.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- the stamps -- what've you 
                         done with --?

               REGGIE starts running downstairs.

                                     ADAM
                         Where are you going? Wait!

               ADAM pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the 
               cage down.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie!

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- SECOND LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate and 
               starts down toward the lobby, the cage a few feet behind 
               her.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie!

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- FIRST LANDING -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE continues to run.

               INT. HOTEL STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

               Between the first landing and the lobby. REGGIE running, the 
               elevator following.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- stop!

                                     REGGIE
                         Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is 
                         dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle 
                         did it!

                                     ADAM
                         I'm not Dyle -- you know that!

                                     REGGIE
                         But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- 
                         !

                                     ADAM
                         Don't be an idiot!

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE reaches the lobby first and, without hesitation, races 
               toward the front door and out. The confused hotel MANAGER 
               behind the desk can only stare in surprise. The elevator, 
               ADAM inside, has not yet reached the bottom.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- ! I want those stamps!

               EXT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

               A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs 
               to it.

                                     REGGIE
                              (indicating the 
                              direction)
                         Palais Royal -- vite!

               Calmly, the DRIVER points to the little printed sign on his 
               windshield reading "ITALIE."

                                     DRIVER
                              (pointing the other 
                              way)
                         Porte d'Italie, moi.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mais c'est très vite! On veut me 
                         teur!

                                     DRIVER
                              (shaking his head)
                         Italie.

               She looks around and sees ADAM come out of the hotel and 
               straight toward her. She turns and runs off toward the Place 
               St. Michel.

               EXT. PLACE ST. MICHEL -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes to the corner. She stops, sees the Métro 
               station ("St. Michel") and rushes to it, scampering down the 
               stairs. ADAM is behind her.

               INT. ST. MICHEL MÉTRO STATION -- NIGHT

               REGGIE comes flying down the stairs and runs past the ticket 
               booth, fishing in her bag for her carnet (booklet of tickets), 
               casting a quick look behind her. CAMERA PANS QUICKLY TO ADAM 
               just coming off the stairs, who runs after her.

               DELETED

               INT. MÉTRO TICKET GATE -- NIGHT

               REGGIE gets to the gate ahead of ADAM and manages to crowd 
               in front of some OTHERS about to pass through. Barely 
               stopping, she holds out her ticket to the GUARD to be punched, 
               then heads down the platform, still running. ADAM gets to 
               the gate but the GUARD stops him as he tries to pass through.

                                     GUARD
                         Billet, Monsieur.

                                     ADAM
                              (breathless)
                         I don't want to go anywhere -- I'm 
                         only trying --

                                     GUARD
                              (pointing off)
                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up 
               and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly 
               empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PASSAGEWAY WALL (TRAVELING)

               The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, 
               forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating 
               two different directions, an arrow for each.

               "DIRECTION: Pte D'ORLÉANS Pte DE CLIGNANCOURT-------"

               Choosing "Clignancourt," she runs off. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 
               180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot 
               pursuit.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every 
               few steps.  Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across 
               the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM.  He has evidently 
               made the wrong turn back in the passageway.

               They stare at each other for a moment.  Then the bell rings, 
               announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back 
               through the exit behind him. Not knowing what to do, REGGIE 
               looks into the darkness of the tunnel. The approaching train 
               can be heard.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to herself)
                         Come on -- please --

               She turns to look at the gate -- slowly, the pneumatic door 
               starts to close. As it does, the train roars into the station.

               INT. MÉTRO PASSAGEWAY -- NIGHT

               The gate can be seen slowly closing. ADAM runs to it, tries 
               to force it back but cannot. Finally, he jumps up and, 
               commando style, vaults over it.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               REGGIE is just entering the red center car (the two on either 
               side are dark green). ADAM runs for the red car and just 
               manages to make it as the doors shut in unison, the latches 
               falling with a concerted click and the little whistle blowing 
               to inform the motor-man to depart. The train starts to move.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               The entire length of the car separates ADAM and REGGIE.

               For a moment, their eyes meet, then ADAM starts to weave his 
               way past the other PASSENGERS, on his way to her.

               Suddenly, he is stopped. ADAM turns to see a TRAIN GUARD.

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                         Billet, Monsieur.

               ADAM shows him his yellow ticket and starts past him, but 
               again the TRAIN GUARD stops him.

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                         Vous êtes dans le premier classe, 
                         Monsieur.

                                     ADAM
                         What?

                                     TRAIN GUARD
                              (heavy accent)
                         This car is for first class only -- 
                         you have a second-class ticket.

                                     ADAM
                         But that's what they gave me.

               He tries to pull away from the TRAIN GUARD and finds himself 
               staring into the serious face of a GENDARME.

                                     GENDARME
                         Monsieur -- ?

               ADAM looks at the GENDARME, then at REGGIE.

               INT. "PALAIS-ROYAL" MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out.

               ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. She remains 
               in the car.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               The GENDARME gestures for ADAM to enter the green, second- 
               class car behind the red, first-class one. Reluctantly, ADAM 
               does.

               INT. MÉTRO CAR -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters and goes to the door through which he can see 
               REGGIE in the car ahead. She is gone. Moving quickly, he 
               returns to the exit door and looks at the platform.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               From ADAM'S P.O.V. She is hurrying toward an exit marked 
               "SORTIE."

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way 
               blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats.

               It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around 
               them.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               REGGIE has entered an area leading to the exit. But as she 
               reaches the stairway leading up to the street level, she is 
               confronted with an iron grill barring her way. She tries to 
               open it, but it is firmly padlocked. A sign hung on it reads 
               "FERMÉ LES WEEKENDS." She turns, desperately looking for 
               some way out.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is off the train. He stands on the platform as the train 
               doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and 
               the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, 
               looking for some sign of REGGIE. He spots the exit marked 
               "SORTIE" (the same one used by REGGIE) and starts toward it.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               As ADAM enters the deserted area. There is, miraculously, no 
               sign of REGGIE. He goes to the locked grill and tries it, 
               testing the padlock. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid 
               door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's 
               hand reaching up to dial a number.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE sits on the floor of the booth, dialing.

                         Balzac 3 - 0 - 0 - 4.

               She holds the receiver to her ear. The number can be heard 
               ringing but no one answers. She hangs up and reaches for the 
               phone book, leafing through its pages.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               ADAM stands for a minute, looking around, not knowing what 
               to do.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

               REGGIE has finished dialing her number and now pushes the 
               button. It clicks loudly.

                                     REGGIE
                         Shh.
                              (into the phone, 
                              whispering)
                         American Embassy? Mr. Bartholomew's 
                         office, please -- Mr. Bartholomew's 
                         office --

               INT. EMBASSY SWITCHBOARD -- NIGHT

               An OPERATOR speaking into a headset.

                                     OPERATOR
                         Could you speak out, please? I can't 
                         quite hear you.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         No, I can't speak any louder -- 
                         Hamilton Bartholomew -- B as in -- 
                         uh -- Bartholomew -- that's right, 
                         and the rest as in Bartholomew!

               INT. EMBASSY SWITCHBOARD -- NIGHT

                                     OPERATOR
                              (on the phone)
                         I'm sorry, but Mr. Bartholomew has 
                         left for the day.

               INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

                                     REGGIE
                              (on the phone)
                         But someone's trying to kill me -- 
                         you've got to send word to him -- in 
                         the center garden of the Palais Royal, 
                         by the colonnade -- tell him I'm 
                         trapped in a phone booth, below him 
                         in the Métro station. And my name's 
                         Lampert.

               INT. EMBASSY SWITCHBOARD -- NIGHT

                                     OPERATOR
                              (on the phone)
                         All right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'll see 
                         what I can do. Goodbye.

               She unplugs the call, plugs in another one and dials quickly.

                                     OPERATOR
                         Hello, Mr. Bartholomew? -- there was 
                         a call for you just now, Mr. 
                         Bartholomew -- it sounded quite urgent -- 
                         a Mrs. Lampert.

               INT. BARTHOLOMEW'S STUDY -- NIGHT

               It is a man we've never seen before, the physical opposite 
               of the old BARTHOLOMEW.

                                     REAL BARTHOLOMEW
                         Lampert? I don't know any Mrs. Lampert -- 
                         trapped in a Métro station? Who does 
                         she think I am, the C.I.A.? All right, 
                         you'd better call the French police.

               INT. MÉTRO SORTIE -- NIGHT

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE BOOTH. As REGGIE's head appears, peeking 
               cautiously over the bottom of the window.

               REVERSE SHOT

               From inside the phone booth. Through the glass ADAM can be 
               seen, leaving the Sortie area.

               MED. SHOT -- PHONE BOOTH

               Carefully, REGGIE opens the door and comes out. She goes to 
               the corner and looks around it.

               INT. MÉTRO PLATFORM -- NIGHT

               From REGGIE'S P.O.V. as ADAM walks away from CAMERA, down

               the platform. CAMERA PANS TO REGGIE, peeking around the 
               corner. She looks the opposite way, sees another exit at the 
               other end of the platform (also marked "SORTIE"). She looks 
               back once more at ADAM, then makes up her mind and starts 
               running towards the exit.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As the bell rings announcing the next train. He turns to 
               look and sees REGGIE.

                                     ADAM
                              (calling)
                         Reggie -- !

               He takes off, running after her.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she runs, ADAM several yards behind her.

                                     ADAM
                              (in b.g., calling)
                         Reggie -- wait!

               She turns into the exit.

               INT. MÉTRO STAIRWAY -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE starts up the long, steep flight of stone steps 
               leading to the street level. ADAM appears behind her, climbing 
               two at a time and gaining.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- why won't you listen?

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm through listening to you!

               He is rapidly closing the gap between them. It is clear that 
               REGGIE is tiring.

                                     ADAM
                         But I didn't kill anybody.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then who did? You're the only one 
                         left.

               PASSERSBY, descending the stairs, stand aside to let the two 
               strange Americans pass, watching in wonderment. ADAM is only 
               a few steps behind now.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- please believe me!

                                     REGGIE
                         No!

               As REGGIE wearily gains the top, ADAM lunges for her. He 
               manages to grab her foot as he falls forward, but all he 
               winds up with is a shoe which has come loose in his hand.

               REGGIE shrieks, then regaining her balance, continues running, 
               limping in her one shoe. ADAM scrambles to his feet and starts 
               after her again.

               INT. MÉTRO TICKET BOOTH AREA -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE, still hobbling, runs through and toward the stairs, 
               leading to the street. CAMERA PANS TO ADAM, as he, too, runs 
               through. He is again several yards behind her.

               EXT. PLACE PALAIS ROYAL -- NIGHT

               As REGGIE comes up the stairs from the Métro. She stops long 
               enough to kick off her other shoe, then runs across the 
               street, ignoring the traffic, toward the Rue de Valois (which 
               forms one side of the Palais Royal). ADAM is gaining on her 
               again.

               EXT. PALAIS ROYAL COURTYARD -- COLONNADE -- NIGHT

               The smaller court at the Comédie-Française end of the Palais 
               gardens, separated from the larger garden by a double 
               peristyle consisting of two twin rows (these separated from 
               each other by a small marble court) of twenty columns each -- 
               in all, eighty columns. The only person in sight is the man 
               we have known as BARTHOLOMEW, waiting at the far end of the 
               columns, looking at his watch impatiently.

               Then, from the Rue de Valois side of the Palais, REGGIE runs 
               into the court. She spots "BARTHOLOMEW" and fishes in her 
               bag for the stamps as she runs, taking them out and waving 
               them.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Bartholomew -- he's chasing me!

               ADAM has run into the court and now skids to a stop at the 
               near end of the colonnade as he spots "BARTHOLOMEW." REGGIE, 
               still running, is halfway between the two men. "BARTHOLOMEW" 
               draws his gun but can't get a shot at ADAM, who has ducked 
               in among the columns.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- stop! That's Carson Dyle!

               This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops, in alarm.

                                     REGGIE
                              (breathless)
                         Carson -- ?

               She looks at "BARTHOLOMEW," then back at ADAM, who has drawn 
               his own gun.

               (NOTE: Both "BARTHOLOMEW" and ADAM are in among the stone 
               columns at opposite ends of the colonnade, keeping out of 
               each other's sight. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps 
               in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to).

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                              (calmly)
                         We all know Carson Dyle is dead, 
                         Mrs. Lampert.

                                     ADAM
                         It's Carson Dyle, I tell you!

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         You're not going to believe him, 
                         Mrs. Lampert -- it's too fantastic. 
                         He's trying to trick you again.

               REGGIE looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do.

                                     ADAM
                         Tex recognized him -- that's why he 
                         said Dyle. If you give him those 
                         stamps, he'll kill you too!

               REGGIE takes a step toward ADAM.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         Mrs. Lampert -- if I'm who he said, 
                         what's preventing me from killing 
                         you right now?

               REGGIE stops, turns back to "BARTHOLOMEW."

                                     ADAM
                         Because he'd have to come out to get 
                         the stamps -- he knows he'd never 
                         make it.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         What's the matter with you, Mrs. 
                         Lampert? Are you going to believe 
                         every lie he tells you? He wants the 
                         money for himself -- that's all he's 
                         ever wanted.

                                     REGGIE
                              (to ADAM, explaining)
                         He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen 
                         him at the Embassy.

                                     ADAM
                         Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         That's right, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm a 
                         dead man -- look at me.

                                     REGGIE
                         I don't know who anybody is any more!

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- listen to me!

                                     REGGIE
                         You lied to me so many times --

                                     ADAM
                              (gently)
                         Reggie -- trust me once more -- 
                         please.

                                     REGGIE
                         Can I really believe you this time, 
                         Adam?

                                     ADAM
                              (a pause)
                         There's not a reason on earth why 
                         you should.

               She looks toward ADAM for a moment, then back to 
               "BARTHOLOMEW", then slowly starts toward ADAM.

                                     REGGIE
                         All right, Adam.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                         Stop right now, Mrs. Lampert, or 
                         I'll kill you.

               REGGIE stops in alarm.

                                     ADAM
                         It won't get you the stamps, Dyle -- 
                         You'll have to come out to get them, 
                         and I'm not likely to miss at this 
                         range.

                                     "BARTHOLOMEW"
                              (now called CARSON)
                         Maybe not -- but it takes a lot of 
                         bullets to kill me. They left me 
                         there with five of them in my legs 
                         and my stomach -- they knew I was 
                         still alive but they left me. I spent 
                         ten months in a German camp -- with 
                         nothing to stop the pain and no food -- 
                         they were willing to take all these 
                         chances for the money, but not for 
                         me. They deserved to die!

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               During the following, he looks around, looking for some way 
               out.

                                     REGGIE'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         But I didn't have anything to do 
                         with --

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         You've got the money. It belongs to 
                         me now! Please believe me, Mrs. 
                         Lampert -- I'll kill you -- a little 
                         more blood won't matter.

               During this ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, 
               creeping cautiously across the open space between the two 
               colonnades and finally, behind the second.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE AND CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         I'll give you five to make up your 
                         mind, Mrs. Lampert.

               She has seen ADAM's move from her angle, but doesn't know 
               quite what to do.

                                     REGGIE
                         Wait, please! I need some time to 
                         think!

                                     CARSON
                         One --

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he slowly moves along behind the second colonnade, his 
               gun ready, trying to get an angle on CARSON.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         -- two --

               Suddenly ADAM stops -- he has caught sight of CARSON through 
               the columns. But he will have a difficult shot.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         -- three --

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         -- four --

               CAMERA PANS DOWN to his gun. As his finger tightens on the 
               trigger and the hammer moves slowly back.

               CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE

                                     REGGIE
                         Adam -- please!

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he aims carefully and fires.

               CLOSE SHOT -- COLUMN

               As the bullet creases it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

               As the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving 
               him unharmed. He wheels.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               With CARSON in the b.g., who fires at him. ADAM ducks behind 
               the column as the bullet hits it and screams off.

               Quickly, he peers back out and throws another shot.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, she turns and runs toward 
               the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her.

               (Beside the door is a poster announcing the forthcoming 
               schedule of presentations.)

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, 
               turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely 
               inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes 
               off after REGGIE.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               Over his shoulder we see a broken picture of CARSON running 
               toward the theatre door, flashing by the near and far columns.  
               ADAM tries to get a shot at him, but can't.

               Finally he runs after him.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON enters and slams the door behind him, locking it.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE DOOR -- NIGHT

               ADAM arriving at the door, bangs on it, then looks around, 
               frustrated. Several yards away he sees a short stairway 
               leading down to a door below the street level. He runs to 
               it, tries the door and enters.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- ORCHESTRA -- NIGHT

               As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around.

               CARSON'S P.O.V.

               As the CAMERA SWEEPS the magnificent old theatre -- boxes, 
               seats, stage, but there is no sign of REGGIE.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As CARSON walks up the aisle checking between the rows of 
               seats.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               A large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage.

               ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along 
               next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic 
               pieces which fill the room.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the 
               footlights, looking for REGGIE. At mid-stage, CAMERA PANS 
               DOWN to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box.  
               Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her 
               breath as she watches him.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board 
               and throws on all the switches. The stage is bathed in light.

               He returns to the stage.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is looking up, having heard the footsteps on the stage 
               over his head -- and hearing them now. He looks around and 
               sees a narrow, curving staircase leading up. He goes to it, 
               and, starting up, finds a door. He tries the knob -- the 
               door is locked.

               INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

               REGGIE, cringing back from the bright light, notices the 
               doorknob turning. It makes a slight clicking sound.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON, upstage, looking behind a piece of classic scenery, 
               hears the doorknob and turns suddenly.

               CARSON'S P.O.V.

               We catch a quick glimpse of REGGIE as she ducks down out of 
               sight.  Too late.

               CLOSE SHOT -- CARSON

                                     CARSON
                         All right, Mrs. Lampert. The game's 
                         over. Come out of there.

               WIDER ANGLE

               REGGIE does not appear.

                                     CARSON
                         I don't want to kill you, Mrs. Lampert --
                         but I will --

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM comes down the stairs from the prompter's box and looks 
               up at the ceiling.

               MED. SHOT -- CEILING

               It is divided into thirty-six square sections, each numbered 
               and lettered -- from 1A to 6F. They are trapdoors.

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               He looks from the ceiling to a row of levers on one wall.

               CLOSE SHOT -- LEVERS

               Thirty-six of them, numbered and lettered to correspond to 
               the traps.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               As CARSON takes a few steps towards the prompter's box, his 
               gun ready.

                                     CARSON
                         Did you hear me, Mrs. Lampert -- ?

               INT. PROMPTER'S BOX -- NIGHT

               REGGIE huddled inside.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM is listening carefully, trying to figure out where CARSON 
               is standing, watching the ceiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP

               It is marked C-4.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I won't wait much longer, Mrs. Lampert

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               As he turns to the levers and reaches for the one marked C-
               4. He is about to pull it.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON takes a few more steps forward.

               INT. TRAPROOM -- NIGHT

               ADAM stops himself from pulling the lever just in time. He 
               lets his held breath escape. He looks back at the ceiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- TRAP

               The one marked C-4. As CARSON's voice is heard, CAMERA MOVES 
               to the next trap, marked D-4.

                                     CARSON'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         I know you're in there, Mrs. Lampert --

               MED. SHOT -- ADAM

               He looks at the lever marked D-4. He is perspiring heavily.

               Now he slowly reaches for the lever.

               INT. COMÉDIE FRANÇAISE -- STAGE -- NIGHT

               CARSON is about to move closer to the prompter's box when 
               suddenly the stage under him opens and he plummets through 
               out of sight. At the same time we hear a shot.

               CLOSE SHOT -- PROMPTER'S BOX

               As REGGIE slowly peers out.

               REGGIE'S P.O.V.

               The empty stage, without being able to see the open trap 
               from this low angle.

               MED. SHOT -- REGGIE

               As she climbs out of the booth and, seeing the open trap 
               now, runs to it, looking down through it.

               MED. SHOT -- OPEN TRAP

               FROM ABOVE, over REGGIE's head. She can see CARSON sprawled 
               on the floor below, face down and dead. ADAM stands beside 
               the body, looking up at REGGIE and smiling.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               As GRANDPIERRE and his TWO ASSISTANTS, guns drawn, walk onto 
               the stage from the wings. They go to the open trap and look 
               down at ADAM.

                                     GRANDPIERRE
                         Mr. Dyle -- you are under arrest for 
                         the murders of Charles Lampert, Herman 
                         Scobie, Joseph Penthollow, Leopold 
                         Gideon, and whoever that is down 
                         there.

               ADAM is surprised, then shakes his head.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- you'd better tell him. He 
                         wouldn't dare hit a girl.

               EXT. RUE DE RIVOLI -- NIGHT

               As a TAXI rolls by the arcades, CAMERA PANNING with it.

               INT. TAXI -- NIGHT (PROCESS)

               REGGIE and ADAM in the rear of the cab. REGGIE has one of 
               her feet in her hand, shoe off, rubbing it.

                                     REGGIE
                         You didn't have to chase me so hard --

                                     ADAM
                         Here, give it to me.

               He starts to take the foot but she pulls it back and offers 
               him the other one.

                                     REGGIE
                         That one's done -- start on this 
                         one.

               He takes the foot and begins rubbing it.

                                     REGGIE
                         I'm sorry I thought you were the 
                         murderer, Adam -- how did I know 
                         that he was as big a liar as you 
                         are?

                                     ADAM
                         And that's all the gratitude I get 
                         for saving your hide.

                                     REGGIE
                         The truth, now -- was it my hide -- 
                         or the stamps?

                                     ADAM
                         What a terrible thing to say. How 
                         could you even think that?

                                     REGGIE
                         All right, prove it to me -- tell me 
                         to go to the Embassy first thing in 
                         the morning and turn in those stamps.

               ADAM says nothing.

                                     REGGIE
                         I said, tell me to go to the --

                                     ADAM
                         I heard you, I heard you.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then say it.

                                     ADAM
                         Reggie -- listen to me --

                                     REGGIE
                         Never mind -- I'll go by myself.

                                     ADAM
                         What makes you think they're even 
                         interested? It's only a quarter of a 
                         million -- it'll cost more than that 
                         to fix up their bookkeeping. As a 
                         taxpayer --

               As REGGIE and ADAM approach the MARINE in full-dress uniform 
               always on guard at the Embassy.

                              (to ADAM)
                         Who's a taxpayer? Crooks don't pay
                         taxes.  Excuse me, soldier --

                         Forgive me. Whom would I see regarding 
                         the return of stolen Government money?

                                     MARINE
                         You might try the Treasury Department,

                         Cruikshank.

                         Do you mind if I wait out here? The 
                         sight of all that money being given 
                         away might make me break out.

               INT. EMBASSY TREASURY OFFICE -- DAY

               A SECRETARY sits behind a desk. She looks up as REGGIE enters.

                                     REGGIE
                         Mr. Cruikshank, please -- my name is

               The SECRETARY picks up her phone and presses a button.

                         Mr. Cruikshank, a Miss --

                                     REGGIE
                         Mrs.

                                     SECRETARY
                         -- a Mrs. Lampert to see you -- yes 
                         sir.
                              (to REGGIE)
                         Go right in.

               REGGIE goes to the door leading to the private office.

               INT. CRUIKSHANK'S OFFICE -- DAY

               Featuring the door as REGGIE enters. She stops suddenly.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Featuring the desk. Behind it sits ADAM (now CRUIKSHANK).

               REGGIE stares at him, unbelievingly, then looks around, 
               confused. By way of explanation he indicates the door to the 
               hall.

                                     REGGIE
                              (blowing up)
                         Well, of all the mean, rotten, 
                         contemptible, crooked --

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Crooked? I should think you'd be 
                         glad to find out I wasn't crooked.

                                     REGGIE
                         You couldn't even be honest about 
                         being dishonest. Why didn't you say 
                         something?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         We're not allowed to tell. May I 
                         have the stamps, please?

                                     REGGIE
                              (reaching into her 
                              bag)
                         Here --
                              (hesitating)
                         Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle 
                         get an office in here, anyway?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         When did you see him -- what time, I 
                         mean?

                                     REGGIE
                         Around one.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         The lunch hour. He probably worked 
                         it out in advance. He found an office 
                         that was usually left open and just 
                         moved in for the time you were here.

                                     REGGIE
                         Then how do I know this is your 
                         office?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                              (picking up the phone)
                         Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to 
                         Bartholomew at Security recommending 
                         that --

                                     REGGIE
                         Bartholomew?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         -- recommending that all Embassy 
                         offices be locked during the lunch 
                         hour.

                                     REGGIE
                         Starting with his own.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                              (hanging up)
                         Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.

                                     REGGIE
                         What's your first name today?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Brian.

                                     REGGIE
                         Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve 
                         me right if I got stuck with that 
                         one.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Who asked you to get stuck with any 
                         of them?

                                     REGGIE
                         Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Yes.

                                     REGGIE
                         But you're -- divorced?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         No.

                                     REGGIE
                              (crestfallen)
                         Oh.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         My mother -- she lives in Detroit. 
                         Come on now -- give me those stamps.

                                     REGGIE
                         Only if you can prove to me that 
                         you're really Brian Cruikshank.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         How about if next week some time I 
                         put it on a marriage license -- that 
                         ought to --

                                     REGGIE
                         Quit stalling -- I want to see some 
                         identification -- now!

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- 
                         I could go to jail.

                                     REGGIE
                         You'd lie about anything.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Well, maybe we'd better forget about 
                         it, then.

                                     REGGIE
                         You can't prove it, can you? You're 
                         still trying to --
                              (the coin drops into 
                              the slot)
                         marriage license! Did you say -- ?

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         I didn't say anything. Will you give 
                         me those stamps?

                                     REGGIE
                         You did too say it -- I heard you.  
                         Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- 
                         er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have 
                         lots of boys -- we can name them all 
                         after you.

                                     CRUIKSHANK
                         Before we start on that, do you mind 
                         handing over the stamps?

                                                                  FADE OUT:

                                         THE END

                

               BONUS ITEM -- Lyrics to the theme song of the film:

                

                                         CHARADE

                      Music by Henry Mancini, Words by Johnny Mercer

               When we played our Charade we were like children posing, 
               Playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we 
               played.

               Oh, what a hit we made. We came on next to closing Best on 
               the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade.

               Fate seemed to pull the strings, I turned and you were gone.

               While from the darkened wings the music box played on.

               Sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, I hear it 
               still, I always will, best on the bill Charade.
CHERRY FALLS
                   SCREENPLAY BY KEN SELDEN
                         FIRST DRAFT





FEBRUARY 14, 1998

FADE IN:

EXT.  TOWN - NIGHT

The hanging sign says 'Entering Cherry Falls, Ohio'

We see Cherry Falls - A small town in rural Northeastern Ohio. This is 
Norman Rockwell land, red barns on dirt roads, a square in the center of 
town. But things are hidden here. The barns are locked, the shades are 
drawn.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  LOVER'S LANE 

A romantic turn-off used exclusively for parking. A river gushes by. 
Crickets chirp. The trees blow in the autumn wind. A single car sits on 
the lonely road. The muffled sound of a young couple making out drifts 
through the streamed up windows.

INT.  CAR

A teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her 
breast. He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her 
bare knee.

As he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently 
pulls it away. She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her 
shirt.

We pull back. STACY and ROD, two healthy sixteen year olds, are 
passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car.

Rod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her 
knee. Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand 
tightly.

                   STACY
               No.

He doesn't give up easy. He playfully wrestles his hand free and slides it 
under her skirt. She grabs his hand again.

                   STACY
               I said no.

                   ROD
               But you don't really
               mean it.

He struggles to free his hand.

                   STACY
               Yes I do. Keep it in your
               pants Rod.

He gives up, aggravated.

                   ROD
               Maybe it won't stay in.
               
                   STACY
               Maybe you better just
               drive me home.

He starts the car, glares at her for a second, then turns it off.

                   ROD
               Let me just ask you a serious
               question first.

                   STACY
               What?

                   ROD
               Aren't you worried you
               could die a virgin?

                   STACY
                 (sarcastically)
                Yeah. I'm extremely worried
               about that. It's right up
               there with global warming.

                   ROD
               On our way home, a drunken
               driver could hit us head on
               and send us flying through
               the windshield. Terminate
               us instantly. We'd never 
               experience what it means to
               make love.

                  STACY
               If sheep don't count.

                  ROD
               That wasn't me ...

                  STACY
               I know. I'm kidding you.
               Chill out.

                  ROD
               Well I'm trying to be real
               here and you're mocking me.

                  STACY
               (softening)
              I'm sorry, but you're not
              going to die a virgin Rod.

EXT.  LOVER'S LANE

There is another car around the bend, hidden from sight. It's an old beat 
up Imperial from the late sixties. Someone is watching them. It's probably 
a psychopath.

INT.  ROD'S CAR

Rod leans in and starts kissing Stacy again.

                   ROD(cont.)
               I don't wanna take that chance.
               I want my first time to be with you.

She kisses him back. He slides his hand under her skirt again.

                   STACY
               Stop it.

He doesn't.
                   STACY
               Rod!

                   ROD
                (exasperated)
               You're being unfair.

                   STACY
               Unfair?!

                   ROD
               Yes. Unfair to me.

He begins to overpower her. This is quickly turning into date rape. SHE 
STARTS TO FIGHT BACK BUT HE DOESN'T STOP. FINALLY, SHE SCRATCHES him 
savagely across the face. This catches his attention. He jumps back, cut 
slightly, surprised.

She opens the car door and quickly escapes.

EXT.  ROAD

She runs away from the car, down the road, very upset.

INT.  CAR

Rod catches himself. He looks at his bloodied face in the rear view mirror 
and realizes what he's done.

He starts up the car.

EXT.  ROAD

Stacy runs down the road alone, still very upset.

INT.  CAR

Rod pulls up next to her and rolls down his window.

                  ROD
              Stacy! I'm sorry.

EXT.  ROAD

She pays no attention to him.

                  ROD
              Please get back in the car, Stacy.

She turns and heads down a path into the dark woods, purposely going where 
he can't follow.

INT.  CAR

Rod, frustrated, hits the steering wheel and floors it.

EXT.  ROAD

As Rod's car tears off, down the road, the other car that was parked at 
lover's lane drives up and pulls over, lights still off.

EXT. WOODS

Stacy heads deeper into the woods. When she finally stops to catch her 
breath and wipe away her tears, she hears someone approaching her. 
Suddenly, the footsteps stop. Stacy senses that someone is watching her.

                  STACY
                Rod?

No answer.

                 STACY
               Is that you Rod?

Still no answer. A little frightened, she starts to walk again.  Again she 
hears the footsteps following her. She stops again. Whoever is out there 
stops too. She looks around in every direction.

                 STACY
               Come out Rod.
               This SCREAM bull shit ain't
               gonna work with me!

No answer. Even the birds have stopped chirping.

                 STACY
                (terrified)
              Rod? You're freaking me
              out. Game's over. I lose.
              Come out and we'll fuck.

She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the 
silhouette of someone standing a few feet away.

The wind picks up. Stacy realizes it isn't Rod. All she can see is that 
whoever is there is carrying a small sledge hammer in one hand and a very 
long, jagged, steel nail in the other.

                  STACY
               (in full panic)
              NO!

Stacy starts to run. The killer starts after her.

EXT.  STACY'S

Rod is sitting in his car in front of Stacy's house at the edge of the 
woods, waiting for her to appear. He checks his watch.

EXT.  WOODS

Stacy runs for the edge of the woods but she isn't quite fast enough to 
elude her pursuer.

                  STACY
              Help!

The killer catches Stacy from behind and savagely smashes her head against 
a tree, cracking a branch. Stacy falls to the ground, dazed.

INT.  CAR

Rod sits up in his seat, thinking he's heard something

EXT.  WOODS

Stacy, half conscious, bleeding from the head, is dragged back deeper into 
the woods.

EXT.  STACY'S

Rod gets out of the car and cautiously moves to the edge of the dark 
woods.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod's POV - The woods are pitch black.

                   ROD
              Stacy?

                  STACY(O.C.)
            (struggling, in the distance)
            ROD!

EXT.  WOODS

The killer kicks Stacy in the side, instantly shutting her up. He gags her 
and ties her to a tree trunk. She struggles, but she's no match for the 
killer.

INT.  CAR

Rod grabs his flashlight from the glove compartment.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod's flashlight beam frantically cuts through the woods.

Rod charges through the woods, desperately looking for any sign of Stacy.

EXT.  WOODS

Stacy's right hand is raised above her head and placed, palm out, against 
a tree trunk.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod searches for Stacy, his flashlight jaggedly cutting the darkness.

EXT.  WOODS

The huge nail, extremely sharp and jagged, is placed in the center of 
Stacy's outstretched palm.

The hammer is pulled back, aimed at the head of the nail.

EXT. WOODS

Rod stops and frantically looks around, knowing he's fighting a losing 
battle.

                  ROD
             Stacy?!

EXT.  WOODS

The hammer descends on the nail.

Stacy screams out in pain, even through the gag, as he hand is nailed to 
the tree.

EXT.  WOODS

Rod hears her muffled cry and runs toward the sound.

Stacy's left hand is now placed up against a different tree.

Another nail is readied.

Stacy tries to free her nailed hand but it's useless. She goes into shock.

Rod's flashlight continues to cut through the night. His feet trample 
fallen branches. Suddenly, he stops. He's found her.

Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each 
tree. She almost looks crucified.

Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's 
terrified eyes. She's looking behind him.

Rod quickly turns around but he's too late.

A knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest.

Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping 
her palms on the nails.

Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth.

Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified.

The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach.

Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned.

A small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is 
placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like 
it's an ordinary pencil.

Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never 
experienced such pain.

Blood drips to the ground.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  NIGHT SKY

The full moon looks down on the town.

EXT.  CUL DE SAC

Another romantic turn off. A view from the top of a hill overlooking the 
sleepy town. A lonely car sits there, the sound of a teenage couple making 
out drifting through it's steamed up windows. It's almost a repeat of the 
first scene.

INT.  CAR

The boy pulls his hand from under the girl's shirt and unsnaps her jeans. 
She pushes his hand away but he puts it right back, wriggling a finger 
down into her pants.

JODY MARKEN, a pretty all-American sixteen year old girl, strong willed 
but still innocent, stops kissing her boyfriend KENNY, trying to hold him 
off. Kenny is also sixteen. He's thin and a bit shaggy, but very cute 
nonetheless. His hair is shoulder length, his stare intense. He takes 
himself seriously, all rebel.

                  JODY
              Cut it out.

                  KENNY
              Why?

                  JODY
              I was supposed to be home
              fifteen minutes ago.

                  KENNY
              So? You're already late.
              A few more minutes won't
              matter.

He slides a second finger into her pants. She closes her legs, making his 
probing much more difficult.

                  JODY
              I got to get home.

                  KENNY
              Fuck your curfew. Most
              sixth graders can stay out
              later than you.

He starts kissing her again.

                  JODY
              Kenny....

She pulls his hand out of her pants. He stares at her for a second, 
completely exasperated. He sits up and starts the car.

EXT.   CUL DE SAC

The car squeals away.

INT.   CAR

Jody and Kenny drive home, not talking.

He pulls up in front of her house.

                  KENNY          
            You know, maybe we ought to
            start seeing other people.

                  JODY
            What?

                  KENNY
            Jody, we've been going out
            for over a year. I love you
            but I'm all out of patience.

Jody doesn't know what to say. She didn't expect this.

EXT.  MARKEN HOUSE

Jody gets out of the car, very upset. Kenny takes off, not even waiting to 
see if she gets inside safely, leaving her all alone on the dark street. A 
car backfires in the distance. A nearby noise  startles her. Something's 
behind the garbage cans. She heads quickly up the driveway, disappearing 
behind the house.

INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE - BACK FOYER

All is quiet in the house. The back door opens. Jody tiptoes up back 
staircase.

INT.  MARKEN'S HOUSE

Jody appears on the second floor. It's a family house, politely decorated 
and immaculately clean. She quietly creeps down the hallway toward her 
room. As she passes her parents' room, she looks down. She's relieved that 
no light is coming from under their door.

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 

Jody creeps into her bedroom and quietly shuts the door. She's made it. 
She sits on the bed to catch her breath.

Something moves in the corner of her room. Jody jumps, scared.
Someone is sitting in her rocking chair.

                 BRENT
            It's almost ten o'clock.

                 JODY
            Daddy you scared me!

                 BRENT
            You're grounded Friday night!

                 JODY
            What? I WAS AT SANDY'S I JUST
            LOST TRACK OF TIME.

BRENT MARKEN gets up and heads to the door. He's a big man, 45 years old, 
well built. He's dressed in a  tree-shirt and jeans.

                 BRENT
            Your curfew is 9:30 and you
            know it, little miss.

                 JODY
            It won't happen again.

                 BRENT
            You said that two weeks ago.

                 JODY
           Dad ! Most of my friends can
           stay out until 11 on school nights
           and 1 on weekends!

                 BRENT
           They're not all the sheriff's daughter.
           Goodnight.

He leaves. Jody is furious. She lies down on the bed to stew. She might at 
well have stayed out. The phone in the hallway rings. She leaps up.

INT.  HALLWAY

Jody runs up to the phone but waits for it to ring a second time before 
picking it up. She crosses her fingers, praying it's Kenny.

                 JODY
            Hello. (beat) One second.
                (to her dad)
            Hey Adolph, it's the station!

Brent comes out and picks up the phone as Jody heads back to her room, 
disappointed.

INT.  BEDROOM

Jody flops on the bed.

                 BRENT(O.C.)
            Hello. (beat) What?

INT.  HALLWAY

Brent it shocked.

                 BRENT
            Where?

MARGE MARKEN, Jody's mother, comes out of the bedroom, sensing something 
terrible has happened. Marge is a couple of years older than Brent. She's 
a bit lifeless, a pretty woman who's whole life is her daughter and a 
bottle of Peachtree Schnapps.

                 BRENT(CONT'D)
            I'm on my way.

INT.  JODY'S

Jody sits up on her bed, also sensing something big has happened.

INT.  HALLWAY

Brent buttons up his shirt.

                  MARGE
            What happened?

                  BRENT
            Two kids were found mutilated
            in the woods. Lock the door
            after me.

Brent grabs his gun belt and heads down the stairs.

Jody appears. She and her mom share a concerned glance.

CUT TO:

EXT. STACY'S HOUSE

Brent pulls up. A lot of official cars are already there.

EXT. WOODS

A trail of flares eerily light up the woods, leading to the crime scene.

EXT.  WOODS

The murder sit. Police cameras flash. Stacy is still nailed to the tree. 
Rod is dead on the ground below her in a puddle of his own blood.

Brent walks up, immediately repulsed by the gruesome sight. His deputy, 
JACK WEBBER, sidles up next to him.

                  DEPUTY
           Her parents reported her missing about
           an hour ago.

A flash bulb momentarily lights up the scene. Brent pulls out his 
flashlight to better survey the carnage.

He starts on Rod, throat slit, chest gutted. He then moves to Stacy, 
looking at one nailed hand, then the other.

                  BRENT
           What kind of a person wakes
           up in the morning and says
           to themselves, 'Think I'll nail
           a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?

                  DEPUTY
           The same type that decides to carve into
           her stomach.

Brent finally shines the flashlight beam on Stacy's stomach. Carved into 
her flesh is the word 'VIRGIN'.

CUT TO:

MONTAGE

High school kids are getting ready for school.

Body parts are being covered. Pants and stocking are pulled up over bare 
teenage legs.

Shirts and bras cover bare teenage chests.

Zippers are pulled tight. Buttons are buttoned.

The school bell rings and the kids arrive in cars, on bikes, walking.

IT'S A TYPICAL small town American high school, somewhat repressed but 
alive. The news spreads quickly about the double killing as the crowd 
splits into its various tribes: punk rockers, jocks, potheads, 
cheerleaders, nerds.

The killing is on everyone's mind.

EXT.  SCHOOLYARD

Jody rides up on her bike and glances across the schoolyard as she locks 
it in the bike rack.

Jody's POV - Kenny is leaning against a tree, talking with a busty girl, 
SHARON.

Jody is upset to see Kenny flirting with someone else. As she starts 
toward the front door of the school, a few other CLASSMATES run up to her. 
She keeps glancing over at Kenny but he doesn't notice her.

                  CLASSMATE 1
                Jody!

                  JODY
                Hi.

                  CLASSMATE 2
                 Was Stacy raped?

                  JODY
                I dunno. My dad never came home
                last night.

Jody's POV - Kenny takes Sharon's hand for a second.

                  CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
                I bet she was. I heard someone
               stuffed a tent spike up her ass.

                  CLASSMATE 2(O.C.)
                Gives new meaning to the idea
                 of getting 'nailed'.

                  CLASSMATE 1(O.C.)
                Ha-ha. So funny. Sickfuck.

Jody doesn't respond. She stares at Kenny.

Jody's POV - Kenny walks into school with Sharon.

CUT TO:

INT.  HOMEROOM

Jody enters her homeroom, still upset.

Her teacher LEONARD MARLISTON is lecturing the class. Leonard is twenty-
five and quite hip looking for a teacher. He has long somewhat stringy 
brown hair. He is a bit thin and is dressed casually, almost in hippy 
attire. He wears wire-rim glasses and lace-up boots.

                    MR. MARLISTON
             No one understands what leads people
             to do irrational things. We only
             know that unpunished violence
             festers, then explodes.

Jody sits down in the back.

                      MARLISTON(CONT'D)
             Witness the L.A. Riots. Years of
             police brutality in forty-eight hours. Jody?

                      JODY
             Yes Mr. Marliston?

                     MR. MARLISTON
             Your dad's in the principal's office.
             He wants to see you.

INT.  HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

Brent is talking to TOM SISLER, the principal. Tom is a wiry, hard 
featured man in his mid-forties. They have known each other for a long 
time but are not really friends. Brent knows Tom too well. Tom's a cynical 
bastard.

Tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene.

                     TOM
              You aren't planning to tell these kids
              that 'virgin' was tattooed into both Stacy
              and Rod, are you?

                    BRENT
              No.

                    TOM
              Good.

                    BRENT
              But I am going to have to question
              all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.

                    TOM
              Fine, just don't mention the carving
              This is going to be a tough enough day
              as it is.

There's a knock at the door. Jody enters.

                    BRENT
              Hi honey.

                    JODY
              Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.

                    TOM
              Hi Jody.

                    BRENT
              I just wanted to check that
              you were okay?

                   JODY
              I'm fine. I've just never had
              someone my age die before.
              It's so weird.

                   BRENT
              How well did you know Stacy and
              Rod?

                   JODY
              I've been in the same class
              with Stacy for years but we
              weren't tight or anything.

                   BRENT
              Had either of them broken
              up with someone recently?
              Hurt someone?

                   JODY
              No. Those two were together
              before Kenny and I started
              hanging out and that's over,
              what, God a year now.

                   BRENT
              I want you to head right home
              after school.

                   JODY
              I will. Is that all?

                   TOM
              Could you tell Mr. Marliston
              we'd like to see him.

                   JODY
              SURE.

She leaves.

                   BRENT
              Why'd you send for Lenny Marliston?

                   TOM
              The kids adore him. They confide
              in him. His patchouli reeking rear
              might know if Stacy and Rod were
              really virgins. Why didn't you
              ask Jody that?

                   BRENT
              She's my daughter, Tom.

                   TOM
              So?

                   BRENT
              So you just don't point
              blank ask your teenage daughter
              about sex.

                   TOM
              Why not? You worried you might
              find out how much she actually
              knows?

Brent gives Tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look.

                   LEONARD
              You rang?

                   TOM
              Come in Leonard. Have you
              met Brent Marken?

                   LEONARD
              No but I've always wanted to.

He shakes his hand firmly.

                   BRENT
              Nice to meet you too. My
              daughter speaks highly of you.

Leonard examines Brent's face carefully. Brent is a little taken aback by 
his intensity.

                   LEONARD
              We have the same color eyes.

                   BRENT
              I guess we do.

CUT TO:

INT. CAFTERIA

MARK SHALE, a seventeen year old, rail thin pothead is sitting at a table 
in the crowded cafeteria eating lunch. The place is a zoo. CINDY, a cute, 
mini-skirted brunette, and BEN,  a frizzy-haired, tattooed, pierced, punk-
rocker, are sitting with him.

Jody is standing at the door with her best friend SANDY, looking for a 
place to sit. Sandy is thin and a little underdeveloped for her age. She 
is wearing very little make-up, a baggy shirt and baggy jeans. Although 
she looks much more tomboyish than Jody and a year or two younger, she is 
still quite cute and curvy, just lacking a  bit in self-confidence when it 
comes to boys. Sandy is staring at Mark.

                   JODY
             Go sit next to him.

                   SANDY
             Who?

                   JODY
             Mark Shale.

                   SANDY
             Why?

                   JODY
             Don't you want to talk to him?
             You watch him eat everyday.

                   SANDY
             I don't watch him eat everyday.

                   JODY
             You stare at him non-stop,
             like every lunch. Like this. Like
             most people stare at car accidents.

Jody imitates Sandy.

                   SANDY
             The seat behind him is open. Come on,
             I can eavesdrop too.

                   JODY
             You eventually have to talk to him.

                   SANDY
             Why? All my mom and dad ever do is
             watch each other eat and they've been
             married for twenty years.

Cindy sees Jody approaching and motions her over.

                   CINDY
             Jody!

Jody starts toward her table.

                   SANDY
              No! That's his table.

                   JODY
              You're going to look really
              amoebic splitting off from me now.

The other three kids look up as Jody sits don.

Sandy has no choice but to sit down next to Mark. She immediately freezes 
up.

                   CINDY
              Did your dad question you
              this morning?

                   JODY
              Just a little.

                   BEN
              Did he ask you if Stacy
              and Rod has ever exchanged
              bodily fluids?

                   JODY
              No. Why?

                   CINDY
              He asked Marliston.

                   JODY
              If they had ever gone all the way?

                   BEN
              Yeah. Chris BERRINGER WAS PARKED
              OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

                  CINDY
              I wonder why it's so important
              to know if they fucked?

Sandy is completely frozen. Jody realizes it. Mark is paying no attention 
to her.

                   BEN
              What I don't understand is
              why they asked Marliston if
              Rod was a virgin. They could have
              asked you Cindy.

                  CINDY
              I never fucked Rod.

                  BEN
              Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.

Jody nudges Sandy under the table, trying to prompt her to say something. 
Sandy can only stare at Mark as he eats.

                   CINDY(O.C.)
              If I'm so all-used-up Ben,
              why do you try to hook me
              up non-stop?

                  BEN(O.C.)
              As fucking if.

Across the cafeteria, a sophomore ANNETTE storms in very upset. She 
confronts DYLAN, her junior boyfriend.

                  ANNETTE
              You're a shitsucking liar!

                  DYLAN
                (taunting)
              Better than being a 'cocksucking'
              liar!

                  ANNETTE
              Shut your face!

Annette leaps on Dylan and starts violently scratching him. Mr. Marliston 
runs over and pulls her off. He drags Annette away.

                  ANNETTE
               He's been telling people....

                   LEONARD
              You can tell me all about it in
              my office. Calm down. We're all
              on edge today.

He guides her out.

Sandy gets up her nerve and makes eye contact with Mark.

                   SANDY
               What's up with that?

Mark opens a TWINKIE and starts to eat it.

                   MARK
               Dylan's been telling people
               that Annette gave him a blow
               job.

                   SANDY
               And she didn't?

Ben and Mark laugh.

                   BEN
                There's a better chance that he
                got head from all five Spice Girls.

                  SANDY
                That's horrible.

Cindy laughs at Sandy. Sandy doesn't appreciate being laughed at.

                  CINDY
                I think it's funny.

                  BEN
               Me too. I'm going to start
               telling people that I saw her drop
                to her knees and latch on to his
                unit vector.

Cindy laughs. The first meeting hasn't gone well for Sandy. Jody feels for 
her and jumps to her rescue.

                   JODY
                You wouldn't?

                  BEN
                I would if Dylan paid me.

INT.  SCHOOL

The bell rings. It's the end of the day.

EXT.  SCHOOL

All the kids charge out. Jody walks out with Sandy.

                  SANDY
               (flustered)
              What am I supposed to say?
              'Nice sweater Mark'? 'Did you
              buy it at Eddie Bauer's?'

                  JODY
                (teasing a bit)
              You could tell him you really
              liked the way he chews with his
              back molars.

                 SANDY
              You're so fucking lucky your
              dad is the sheriff.

                 JODY
              You are 'sp fucking' wrong.

                 SANDY
              You get to be a little Chelsea
              Clinton. Everyone wants to meet
              you. Party with you. Have sex with you.

                 JODY
              But you can't do any of it.
              So it sucks. I always have to
              'set an example'.

Jody stops, noticing something.

EXT.  PARKING LOT

Jody's POV - Kenny is walking to his car with Sharon.

Sandy sees how upset Jody is.

                  SANDY
               He's just trying to mess
               with your head. Ignore
               him.

                   JODY
               Does she fuck?

                  SANDY
               (trying to comfort)
               I doubt it. Who'd want
               to fuck her. She probably
               reeks worse than the docks
               down in those panties.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET 

Jody is slowly pedaling her bicycle next to Sandy.

                   JODY
                (frustrated)
              Mr. Jenkins called on me in
              class today. It was so embarrassing.
              I was seriously spaced. I'd been thinking
              about Kenny for over twenty minutes.
              When I snapped out of it, I looked pathetic.
              I was teared up. Everyone was staring at me.

                  STACY
             What did you say?

                  JODY
             That I was sorry. I'd drifted off.
             That I'd been thinking about Stacy
             and Rod.

                  SANDY
             Oh nice save.

                  JODY
             I was desperate. It was gross.

                  SANDY
             Kenny'll come running back.
             This is just his way of pressuring
             you.

                  JODY
             He says he loves me.

                  SANDY
             Personally I think he has a deep,
             almost pathological desire to corrupt
             you. But I suppose that's a type of love.
             I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.

                  JODY
                 (musing)
            Maybe I should blister through a bottle of
            Tequila and just fuck his brains out.

                  SANDY
            No!

                  JODY
            You're the one always saying 'Just do it'.

                  SANDY
            That was before he pulled this 'Dick me
            or I dump you' shit. I say fuck his best
            friend.

Jody laughs.

                  JODY
            I don't know what I'm so scared of.

                  SANDY
            Want to come in for awhile?
            Log onto AOL, flirt with some married men,
            head into a private S&M chat room . . .

                  JODY
            How do you know what to type back when
            they start to cyber with you.

                  SANDY
            I keep a couple of my dad's porno books
            hidden in my desk for emergency reference.

Jody laughs.

                  JODY
            I promised I'd go right home after school.

                  SANDY
            OK. increase the peace.

Sandy hip-hops up her driveway and into her house. Jody jumps on her bike 
and pedals off down the street.

Dissolve to:

EXT. CHERRY FALLS - NIGHT

Night has set again on the town. An OWL HOOTS. THE STREETS ARE QUIET.

EXT.  STREET

The killer's car, the black IMPERIAL, lurks in the shadows of a suburban 
street. The killer is staking out a specific house.

EXT.  ANNETTE'S HOUSE

Annette, the girl who flipped out in the cafeteria appears at the front 
door. Her MOTHER and FATHER are going out.

They kiss ANNETTE goodbye, get in their car and drive away. Annette heads 
back inside and double locks the door.

Annette's parents pull up in front of a restaurant and head inside.

THE KILLER'S IMPERIAL PULLS up across the street.

The killer's car drives away.

EXT.  ANNETTE'S

A gloved finger pushes in the back doorbell.

INT.  BACK HALLWAY

Annette opens the back door. It's chain locked. She peeks through the 
chain,

EXT. HOUSE

Someone is standing there in the shadows.

                  KILLER(O.C.)
              HI. Annette?

It's a WOMAN'S VOICE.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT.  HOUSE

Annette has never seen this woman before. WE still don't see the killer's 
face.
     
                  ANNETTE
                 (suspicious)
             Yeah?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
            I'm Lisa Sherman. Dylan's
            aunt. He asked me to come
            talk to you.

                  ANNETTE
            Why?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
            He feels terrible about those things
            he said to you in school.

                 ANNETTE
                 (really angry)
           He should. Four guys hit on me today,
           and not because they find me intellectually
           stimulating.

                 KILLER(O.C.)
           I think I know how to restore your
           reputation.

                  ANNETTE
                (excited)
           You do?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
           Can I come in? I'll need to use the
           phone.

Annette isn't sure what to do but this is too important to pass up.

                  ANNETTE
            Sure.

Annette unlocks the chain. The killer heads inside.

THE DOOR OMINOUSLY closes behind them.

INT.  RESTAURANT

Wine is being poured into already half-filled glasses.

Annette's parents and the other couple are now a little tipsy, much looser 
than when we saw them earlier. They are laughing, rubbing each other, 
getting physical.

The other HUSBAND leans in and kisses Annette's' mother on the nose. 
Annette's father is at first taken aback but then he responds by kissing 
the other WIFE on the ear. They all laugh. It's getting fancy for Cherry 
Falls.

INT.  HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY

ANNETTE comes charging down the hallway, groggy, bleeding profusely from 
the side of her head, terrified.

                  ANNETTE

Annette charges into her bedroom and slams the door behind her, locking 
it. She quickly pulls her dresser in front of the door.

The door handle moves. The killer is on the other side.

Annette picks up the telephone. it's dead.

The killer kicks the door a couple of times.

Annette backs away from the door, all the way to the window. She grabs a 
sharp pen, holding it like it's a knife. The kicking stops, All is 
momentarily quiet.

Suddenly the killer's shadow appears in the window behind Annette. The 
window smashes an d Annette's neck is pulled towards the shards of glass 
that remain in the broken window.

Annette struggles but she's not strong enough.

INT.  HALLWAY

Annette's mom starts down the hallway, noticing the trail of blood leading 
to Annette's door, realizing something is wrong.

                   MOTHER

It begins to splinter.

they barge in.

The room seems to be empty except the window has been broken and blood's 
splattered around it.

                   MOTHER
             Annette?

She notices the shade to the other window has been drawn and is flapping 
oddly, caught on something.

She walks over, frightened, gathers her nerve, then pulls the shade up.

in.

             She just turned off her light.

Brent darts up the stairs.

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 

Jody is in bed. There's a soft knock on the door. She rolls over.

                  JODY
             Come in.

Brent walks in and seats himself on the edge of the bed.

                  BRENT
             Hi honey.

                 JODY
             What's wrong?

                  BRENT
             I have a question to ask you.
             A personal question.

Jody sits up, pulling the covers up over her breasts.

                 JODY
               (uncomfortable)
             How personal?

Brent takes a deep breath. He's really uncomfortable.

                  BRENT
             I need to know how far you
             and Kenny went?

Jody is really uncomfortable with this question.

                 JODY
             What do you mean?

                 BRENT
               (gently probing)
            Well, I assume you let him kiss you?

                 JODY
            Well yeah. Of course.
            Everyone kisses.
     
                 BRENT
            I'm not criticizing.
                (very uncomfortable)_
            Did you two get any further?

                  JODY
            A little.

                 BRENT
            How much further?

                 JODY
            Daddy! I DON'T THINK THIS IS
            ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS!

                 BRENT
            I wouldn't ask if I didn't have
            to.

                 JODY
            Not much further.

                  BRENT
            You never went, uh, all the way?

                 JOY
               (sighs)
            No.

Brent nods, worried. He's obviously upset.

                 BRENT
               (very worried)
            Ok.

                 JODY
               (confused)
            Daddy, are you upset that
            I'm still a virgin?!

                BRENT
            No honey.

                JODY
            You are upset.

                   BRENT
            I'm not.

                JODY
               (upset)
            I thought you'd be pleased.

                BRENT
            I am. I'm so very proud
            of you. Go back to sleep.

He kisses her on the forehead and heads out. She is very confused.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Brent comes down the stairs.

                 MARGE
             Well?

                 BRENT
             She's still a virgin.

                 MARGE
             Did you warn her?

                 BRENT
             No. Let her get at least
             one more peacefully night's
             sleep.

EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

It's a new day. As the kids arrive at school, rumors are flying. Everyone 
is a little more on edge. The same tribes exist but kids are starting to 
glance and listen to kids from other tribes. The social structure is 
starting to fray.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

Brent is upset, confused.

                   BRENT
              If I'd gone public with this
              yesterday Annette Michaels might
              be alive today.

                   TOM
              Oh GOD Brent, is there anything
              you don't feel guilty about?

                   BRENT
              is there anything you do?

                    TOM
             Focus on the present. You always
             want to change the past. Let's figure
             out what you are going to tell the parents
             today, not what you should told them
             yesterday.

                   BRENT
             I'm going to tell them everything I know.
             I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.

                   TOM
             You tell these people someone is out there
             killing virgins and we're going to have a     
             goddamn fuckfest on our hands.

                  BRENT
             Better than a pile of dead teenagers.

EXT.  TOWN HALL

The town bell rings in the steeple. It's eight o'clock.

EXT.  MAIN STREET

The shops close down. All the townsfolk head toward the assembly hall.

EXT.  SCHOOL

The parents arrive. They are all concerned. They've all heard rumors by 
now. They hurry into the school, whispering to one another.

INT.  AUDITORIUM

The parents are seated, whispering, buzzing. Brent walks up to the podium. 
He's very nervous as he looks out at the crowd, realizing he's going to 
really, really upset them. He takes a deep breath.

                  BRENT
            I think you all know why I CALLED THIS
            Town meeting. In the last two days, three
            of our children have been murdered and it
            appears that we have now established a common
            link between the killings.

The crowd grows still. Everyone is interested in this information.
Brent pauses.

                   FATHER 1
             Well, what is it?

                   BRENT
             All three of the victims attended our
             public high school and all three were or appear
             to have been...um...virgins.

There is a ripple of confusion that runs through the auditorium.

                   MOTHER 1
             So?

                   MOTHER 2
                (very concerned)
             You're almost positive that's
             who this monster is targeting?

                   MOTHER 1
             Virgins?

                   BRENT
             We found the word 'virgin' written
             at both crime scenes.

                    FATHER 1
             Why didn't you tell us this yesterday?

                   BRENT
             We didn't think this was a serial killer.
             We thought it was an isolated incident.

This is all very upsetting to everyone.

                   MOTHER 3
             Are you close to an arrest?

                   BRENT
             I can't say we are.

                   FATHER 2
             What are we supposed to do?

                   BRENT
             What do you mean?

                    MOTHER 2
             What are we supposed to tell
             our kids?

                   FATHER 2
             To go out and get laid if they
             wanna feel safe?

                   BRENT
             I think that's' up to each and
             everyone of you.

                   FATHER 3
            I can't lock my daughter in
            the basement.

                   FATHER 2
            I wouldn't worry about it Victor.

A few other parents laugh.

                   FATHER 3
            What's that supposed to mean?

                   FATHER 2
            Nothing.

                   FATHER 3
            What are you saying about my
            daughter?

Father 3 starts towards Father 2. Tempers are short.

                   FATHER 2
               (getting worried)
            Calm down. I was joking.

Father 3 pushes Father 2.

                   FATHER 3
            Hell of a time to be joking about
            a thing like that you sick bastard!

Father 3 swings at him. A fight ensues. Other parents start to jump in. 
Tempers are short. Brent leaps down to break it up.

EXT.  TOWN

A match lights a long fuse.

Fire crackles along the ground toward a huge string of firecrackers and 
Roman candles. They ignite. The firecrackers explode as balls of fire 
shoot into the night sky. TEENAGERS howl.

INT.  SANDY'S BEDROOM

Jody is talking on the phone to Sandy. Sandy's room is typical teenage 
room, identical in feel to Jody's.

                    SANDY
               (really worried)
            What are we going to do?

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM

Jody is lying on her bed.

                    JODY
            Sandy, you have to chill out,
            at least two-thirds of the kids
            in our class are still virgins.
            He can't butcher all of us.
     
                    SANDY
            There will be a lot fewer by
            tomorrow night.

EXT.  HOUSE

The killer's imperial pulls up across the street from Jody's.

INT.  JODY'S

                    JODY
            Not that many.

                     SANDY
            You watch. There's going to be
            a hymen holocaust tomorrow.
            Maybe I'll finally talk to Mark
            Shale.

                    JODY
            NO?!

There's a sound on the phone. Sandy's brother ANDY has picked it up.

                   SANDY
            Andy! I'm on the phone!

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS AT SANDY'S

ANDY, Sandy's thirteen year old brother is on the line.

                   ANDY(ON THE PHONE)
             I just wanted to offer my
             services to Jody.

                   SANDY
             Your services?

                    ANDY
             I'm willing to help save her life.
             Jody, if you want to come over right
             now. We could slip up into the attic for
             a few minutes. There's an old mattress
             up there...

                   SANDY
             MOM!

Andy hangs up laughing.

INT.  JODY'S

Jody chuckles but all of a sudden the line goes dead.

                   JODY
              Hello?

Jody tries to call back but the phone isn't working. This spooks her. The 
doorbell rings downstairs. Now Jody is more than spooked. She's SCARED. 
She goes to the window to see who it is.

EXT.  HOUSE 

Someone is standing in the shadows below. All Jody can make out is that 
it's a woman.

INT.  STAIRS

Jody, dressed only in her nightshirt, cautiously heads downstairs to the 
back door.

INT.  BACK HALLWAY

JODY looks through the back door window.

EXT.  BACK DOOR

There's someone in the shadows.

Jody opens the door a crack.

                   JODY
               Yes?

                    KILLER(O.C.)
               Are you Jody?

Once again, a woman's voice.

                    JODY
               Yeah.

                    KILLER(O.C.)
               I'm Kenny's Aunt Lisa.

                   JODY
               Kenny's aunt?

                  KILLER(O.C.)
               Yes. He asked me to come over
               and talk to you.

Jody senses something is off.

                   JODY
               On what side of the family?

                   KILLER(O.C.)
               His mother's side.

                    JODY
                His mother's an only child.

Jody suddenly gets it and tries to slam the door closed but the killer is 
too fast, sliding a hand and foot in, pushing her way into the house.

Jody fights to push the door shut but she can't. The killer is stronger. 
The killer's hand gropes for the lock latch.

Jody frantically looks around for a weapon and spots an electric 
screwdriver sitting in the back pantry. She grabs for the screwdriver with 
one hand as the killer pushes harder.

Jody drills the killer's elbow.

The killer screams and lets go. Jody slams the door shut, double locking 
it.

INT.  FRONT HALLWAY

Jody runs to the front hall and double locks the front door.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Jody picks up a phone but it's dead downstairs too. She looks around.

EXT.  HOUSE

She notices a shadow move across the back window. The killer hasn't left. 
The killer seems to be following her.

INT.  FRONT HALL CLOSET

Jody grabs a baseball bat from the front hall closet. The killer's shadow 
appears outside.

INT.  KITCHEN 

Jody runs into the kitchen, grabs a knife. The window above her breaks. 
The killer is right outside.

INT.  DINING ROOM

Jody runs into the dining room, not sure where to go. Suddenly the window 
breaks there. The killer is stalking her from the outside.

INT.  HOUSE - MONTAGE

THE HOUSE is under siege and Jody is trapped in it. She runs from room to 
room, turning the lights out but windows break wherever she goes. It's 
terrifying.

INT.  FOYER

Suddenly there is a silence. Jody stops running. She realizes that the 
killer must be climbing in somewhere. Jody isn't sure what to do.

She hears something in the family room.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM

Jody enters. She sees the killer's shadow cross the window. She runs out.

INT.  HALLWAY

Jody creeps through the dark house, unsure where to go.

INT.  DEN

Jody creeps back into the den. The killer doesn't seem to be there either.

The window is broken. The curtains flap in the breeze. She moves toward 
it, wondering whether it's safe to climb out. She looks in the mirror.

In the mirror, Jody can see the killer's shoes peeking out from under the 
drapes. The killer's in the room. The drapes start to move.

Jody turns around and swings the bat, hitting the killer squarely in the 
head, sending her to the ground, pulling the drapes down.

INT.  HOUSE

Jody tears for the front door.

INT.  FRONT HALL

Jody's too nervous to unlock the front door.

She hears the killer coming so she tears up the stairs.

INT.  STAIRCASE

Jody scampers up the staircase but she's not fast enough. The killer grabs 
her leg through the wooden slatted banister starts pulling her off the 
staircase, breaking the wooden slats.

Jody grabs one of the jagged slats and rams the sharp end into the 
killer's hand, freeing herself.

INT.  STAIRS

Jody charges up the stairs and into the bathroom.

INT.  BATHROOM

Jody closes the bathroom door and locks it.

The killer starts kicking it in.

INT.  BATHROOM

Jody opens the small bathroom window to climb out on the roof.

The door starts to splinter.

Jody tries to wriggle her way out but it's tight.

Behind her she hears the door splintering open.

EXT.  ROOF

Jody squeezes through and grabs hold of the chimney, using it to pull 
herself out.

INT.  BATHROOM

The killer's hand grabs Jody's leg just as Jody's pulling herself free. 
The killer closes the window on Jody's leg, trapping it inside. Out comes 
the razor.

EXT.  ROOF

Jody fights for her freedom, tugging at the chimney, kicking and 
screaming: All of a sudden she feels a surge of pain. She screams and 
kicks with all her might, freeing herself, her momentum sending her 
rolling down the roof. She rolls off the roof, barely grabbing hold of the 
gutter, hanging from it.

The gutter starts to break.

Above her she can hear the killer coming out onto the roof.

The killer's silhouette hovers above, ready to grab her.

Jody knows she has no choice.

Jody lets go of the gutter.

EXT. BACKYARD

Jody falls twenty feet to the ground below.

                  JODY
              Help!

EXT.  ROOF

THE KILLER IS GONE.

EXT.  BACKYARD

Jody looks back down at her bloody leg. There is a 'V' carved into it.

CUT TO:

EXT.  HOUSE

Later that night. Police cars are lined up outside the house.

INT.  HOUSE

Police are scouring the house. Jody is trying to sup some hot chocolate 
but her hands are still shaking.

                JODY
            It was a she.

                 BRENT
            Are you sure?

                JODY
           She said she was Kenny's aunt Lisa.

Her mom comes in with a bottle of cognac, ready to pour a little into 
Jody's cup.

                BRENT
           What are you doing?

                 MARGE
           This will relax her.

                 BRENT
           She's underage.

Brent motions towards the cops, his co-workers, who are scurrying around 
the house. Mom gives Brent a dirty look and pours just a spot into Jody's 
glass. Sandy enters. She sees Jody and runs to her.

                SANDY
           Oh my god. ARE YOU OK?

Jody breaks into tears. They hug.

                 JODY
           Someone tried to kill me.

                 SANDY
           The phone just went dead.
           I called the police and ran
           right over as fast as I could.

Sandy is really terrified too.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

Another morning in CHERRY FALLS. The town may look peaceful but it isn't.

INT.  SANDY'S BATHROOM

Sandy is getting dressed in her usual manner but he hand is shaking. She's 
still terrified. She looks at herself in the mirror and decides to make a 
change.

Lipstick goes on. mascara and eyeliner follow.

Sandy examines herself in the mirror. She's all made-up. SHE USUALLY wears 
a tenth as much.

INT.  SANDY'S BEDROOM

Sandy slides into a slightly provocative dress. She looks much hotter than 
she did when we first met her.

INT.  STAIRCASE

Sandy starts down the stairs. She stops to check out where her mother is.

INT.  KITCHEN

SANDY'S MOTHER is making breakfast.

INT.  STAIRCASE

Sandy hurries downstairs, grabs her coat and heads out the door, hoping 
her mom won't notice how she's dressed.

Her mom hears her and catches a glimpse of her new outfit.

                 MOTHER
            You're wearing a skirt?

Sandy doesn't want to get into it. She charges right out the door.

                 SANDY
            Bye mom.

EXT.  SANDY'S HOUSE

Sandy goes tearing up the street as her mother opens the door after her.
                 MOTHER
            SANDY?!

No way is Sandy turning around.

EXT.  SCHOOL

The kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast 
about Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little 
extra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity 
everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.

The normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are 
sexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids 
together. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds, 
cheerleaders with potheads.

In the parking lot, we see that Aunt Lisa's IMPERIAL is parked. The killer 
is close by.

EXT.  FRONT OF SCHOOL

Sandy arrives at school. She looks around.

She spots Mark talking with Cindy and BEN. She gathers her confidence up, 
unbuttons her top button to reveal what cleavage she has, and starts 
towards them.

Cindy is laughing at Ben.

                 CINDY
             I'm not fucking you.
             Not for all your CDS.

                  BEN
             You want me to die? I thought
             you and I were tight.

                 CINDY
             ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?

                 BEN
             WOULD that impress you?
             IS that what it takes to
             impress the empress?

                 CINDY
             Your mind is just twisted enough.
             I believe you'd do all this just to
             get a dip or two.

Sandy walks up.
                 SANDY
             Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.

                  MARK
             Hi Sandy.

They all stare at her for a second, noticing the change in her appearance.
                 BEN
             Did you want something?

Sandy freezes. She doesn't known what to say.

                  SANDY
               (almost frozen)
            Yes.(beat) I was just curious
            Mark, if you brought a Twinkie
            today?

Ben and Cindy crack up. That was a really lame, stupid question.

                 BEN
              (sarcastically)
            You wonder about that everyday Sandy?

                 MARK
            Shut up Ben.
                 (to sandy)
            Actually, my mom always
            packs two.

                  SANDY
            You got a great mom.
            I'm lucky to get a zucchini
            stick.

                  MARK
            Did you want one?

                  SANDY
             (trying to cover)
            Yeah I was talking about Twinkies
            the other day and I realized I hadn't had one
            in years. Then I remembered seeing you with
            one.

                   MARK
            They're tasty.

He gets out the Twinkie and gives it to her. She unwraps it and takes a 
bite. Ben and Cindy watch, amazed and entertained.

                 SANDY
            Thanks.

Sandy gets  a little cream on her cheek and licks it away with her tongue, 
a little embarrassed. The sight of her tongue turns Mark on.

                 MARK
            You can have both if you want.

                 SANDY
            No, you keep one.

Cindy laughs. The pairing up has started.

CUT TO:

INT.  POLICE STATION

Jody is sitting in the police station working with a SKETCH ARTIST.

                  JODY
           A little larger nose.

The artist makes a change.

                 ARTIST
           How's that?

Jody re-examines the picture. She's spooked.

                  JODY
           That's her.

The artist picks up the phone and dials.

                  ARTIST
           Brent, we got a sketch.

Brent comes into the room and picks up the sketch, 

FOR THE FIRST TIME we see a picture of the killer. She looks about 
eighteen years old and has her hair done in an old fashioned wave. She 
looks like your average small town girl from the late sixties.

Brent's face goes white when he sees who it is.

Jody notices this.
               
                  JODY
             You know her?

                  BRENT
             It can't be.

                  JODY
             Who is she Daddy?

                  BRENT
             Never mind darling.
             You go back to school.
             I don't want you missing
             anymore classes today.

He picks up the picture and heads quickly into his own office. Jody 
watches through his window, sensing he's very, very upset.

INT.  OFFICE

Brent picks up the phone and quickly dials a number.

INT.  MAIN ROOM

Jody has never seen her dad like this. She quietly picks up the phone and 
listens in.

Her dad is talking to the principal, Tom Sisler.

                 BRENT
           IT'S LISA SHERMAN. But she still
           looks like we're eighteen.

                  TOM
              (on phone)
            That's impossible.

                  BRENT
              (growing frantic)
           I swear to God. It's her.
           She told Jody she was Kenny's
           'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this
           sickly feeling...

                  TOM
           Calm down Brent.

INT.  OFFICE

Brent looks out and sees that JODY is on the phone, eavesdropping.

                  BRENT
           I'll call you right back.

INT.  MAIN ROOM

Jody, busted, hangs up.

Brent comes storming out. HER FATHER is livid. SHE'S NEVER SEEN HIM SO 
ANGRY AND UPTIGHT.

                 BRENT
            You were eavesdropping.

                  JODY
              (a little scared)
            No I wasn't.

                  BRENT
           What did you hear?

                  JODY
           Nothing. I just picked up the phone
           to say goodbye to you. You didn't say
           goodbye.

                  BRENT
           Ok. Goodbye. Now get back to school.

She nods and heads out, freaked. Her father's never treated her this 
harshly before.

EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL

As Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the 
attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. 
She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a 
Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone 
badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more 
feet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's 
just a  couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.

Jody heads toward the main school entrance. She starts noticing a lot of 
kids are outside, a few more hidden from sight, having sex. Something's 
up. 

INT.  HIGH SCHOOL

Jody opens her locker. Sandy comes running up to her, very excited.

                 SANDY
            You ok?

                 JODY
           (noticing Sandy's attire)
           FINE. Are you?

                  SANDY
           Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the
           whole school. Guess what?

                  JODY
           What?

                  SANDY
              (whispering)
            Mark invited me to the party.

                  JODY     
             What party?

                  SANDY
           Shh. Ben's party. Tonight.
           Haven't you heard?

                 JODY
           No.

Sandy notices that a teacher is nearby. Sandy pulls Jody into a stairwell.

INT.  STAIRWELL

Jody is now really intrigued.

                  SANDY
              (whispering)
           You can't tell your parents.

                  JODY
           Ok.

                  SANDY
           Especially not your dad.

                  JODY
           I won't.

                  SANDY
             (whispering)
           It's like a pop your cherry party.
           Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.

                 JODY
           You're thinking of sleeping with Mark
           tonight?

                  SANDY
           Unless he makes a move during
           seventh period.

                  JODY
           Didn't you have something a little
           more romantic in mind for your first
           time?

                 SANDY
             (very excited)
           I kind of like the idea that we can all
           lose it together, on the same night.
           It'll be a lot less scary. You have to
           go.

                 JODY
           Stag?

                SANDY
           Kenny'll want to go with you.
           Cindy's holding a Q and A
           session at the bleachers.
           Come on.

                JODY
           I can't right now.

                 SANDY
           Jody, you have to go to the party.
           For your own safety.

Sandy takes off.

EXT.  BLEACHERS

Cindy is setting with a group of girls, the center of attention.

                CINDY
            You all are such hypocrites.
            All year long you sit on your
            judgmental little butts and 
            call me the slut from hell.
            NOW YOU RUN TO ME, quaking in fear,
            BEGGING for advice...

                HYPOCRITE GIRL 1
           Yeah. SO?

                 HYPOCRITE GIRL 2
           What were we supposed to call you
           Cindy?

                 GIRL 1
           The slut from heaven?

                GIRL 3
            Just answer our questions please?

Sandy runs up.

                CINDY
               (loving the role)
           What do you want to know?

                 GIRL 3
           What to do.

                CINDY
           You have to do everything
           Boys are totally clueless when
           it comes to sex.

This answer terrifies the audience.

                 CINDY(cont'd)
           It starts with them trying to
           unhook our bras, fumbling around,
           and never changes. Wait until they try
           to put their dicks in you.

                 GIRL 2
           Please don't say they need our help
           with that.

                 CINDY
           Always. Unless you want them to just
           poke around endlessly.

The girls had no idea.

INT.  CAR

Three stoners are smoking a bowl in their car. They are not nearly as 
collaborative or supportive of one another as the girls were.

                BOY 1
           Romeo here asked me if chicks has two
           holes or three.

                 BOY 2
           I did not.

                BOY 1
           You did so.

                 BOY 2
           I was kidding.

                BOY 3
           Were not dude.

                 BOY 1
           I know it's a total bummer
           that three kids are dead, but, I'm sorry,
           this is kind of great.

                 BOY 3
           I'm way into this. This may be the best
           of all possible worlds.

                 BOY 2
           No. The killer could be offing
           chicks who haven't given head.

They all laugh again and nod, slapping hands, Beavis and Butt-head style.
                BOY 2
           Then I'd only have to worry about
           one.

They all laugh again.

EXT.  PARKING LOT

Two HOMELY GIRLS, one rail thin, the other slightly overweight, walk back 
towards the school.

                 HOMELY GIRL 1
           We'll meet someone at the party.

                 HOMELY GIRL 2
           You don't know that.

                 HOMELY GIRL 1
           If we don't, we sit back and watch
           everyone else camel.
           That's got to be better than
           hanging at your house.

                 HOMELY GIRL 2
           I'm not going.

They notice a group of kids huddled around a car.

                  HOMELY GIRL 1
           What's that?

They walk up.

'VIRGIN' has been written in blood on one of the windshields.  A mutilated 
boy looks out of the driver's window of the car.  The girl's faces go 
white. IT'S ANOTHER BODY!

More and more kids gather around the murder site. The kids are all 
freaked, giving each other the eye. No one wants to be next.

All of a sudden the body moves, screaming to the heavens, freaking all the 
kids out. The dead body leaps out of the car and runs away as other kids 
and teachers run over. Everyone heard the scream.

Homely girl 2 whispers to her friend.

                   HOMELY GIRL 2
                (whispering)
             Ok. Pick me up at seven.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Chaos has taken over the school. Hardly anyone is still going to classes.

Kenny is standing in the hallway, looking for Jody. He knows her class 
schedule and that she'll be passing by.

Jody appears from her classroom. She starts toward Kenny, at first not 
noticing him.

Jody looks up and she sees him. She stops. She knows what he's there to 
talk to her about. He runs over to her.

                   KENNY
                (very concerned)
           Are you O.K.?

                    JODY
           I'm fine.

                    KENNY
           I heard you got attacked.

                   JODY
           I did.

                    KENNY
           I was worried about you.
           Did you hear about the bash?

                    JODY
           Yeah. I think it's really sick.

                    KENNY
           Why?

                    JODY
           Three of our classmates are dead.
           That's not really the occasion
           for a party.

                   KENNY
           Nobody wants to be the fourth.
           Please go with me.

                   JODY
           Did Sharon say no?

                    KENNY
           You know I want to go with you.

                    JODY
           I'm so flattered but I can't.
           I'm grounded.

                    KENNY
            Everyone's grounded. There's a
           killer on the loose.

                    JODY
           No I'm really grounded.
           When I got in late the other night,
           my father was waiting up for me. 

He grabs her passionately.

                    KENNY
           If you don't want to go with me just
           say so. Say 'Kenny, I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
           LOVE TO YOU' but don't use your dad as an
           excuse. I'm so sick of it.

                   JODY
           I'm not using him as an excuse.

OF COURSE SHE IS.

                   KENNY
           Yes you are. You always do.
           It's why we broke up. You always
           hide behind him.
     
                    JODY
           I do not.

                    KENNY
           I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S
           permission just to kiss you.
           Jody, it's time to assert yourself
           To be a big girl. An individual.
           I'm going to this party tonight.
           Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my
           house after school. We'll go together.

                   JODY
           I have to go home after school.
           I have something really important
           I have to ask my mom.

                 KENNY
           They're not picking me up until six.

                 JODY
           I'll think about it.

                  KENNY
           Yes!

He kisses her full throttle. She's into it. She smiles at him as he darts 
off. She's happy but scared. She's got her guy back, at least for the 
moment.

INT.  SCHOOL

The clock strikes three. The bell rings.

EXT.  SCHOOL

Kids charge out, ready for a memorable evening.

INT.  JODY'S HOUSE

Jody's mother is in the kitchen, preparing dinner, watching TV.

                 REPORTER
                (on TV)
          A series of savage killings has turned
          this small community of Cherry Falls, Ohio
          inside out. In the last two days, three teenagers
          have been killed, a fourth attacked. The killer
          seems to be targeting high school virgins. Here's
          our WWJB reporter Mike Stanton outside the local
          high school with an up to the minute report.

EXT.  HIGH SCHOOL

MIKE STANTON turns around toward the high school to report on the day's 
events but before he can get a word out a young GIRL who has recognized 
him, walks up to him. Her GIRLFRIENDS giggle behind her.

                 GIRL
            Hi.

                 MIKE
            Hi, I'm Mike Stanton.

                 GIRL
            I know.

She grabs him and kisses him. He's shocked. She runs off giggling with her 
friends. A boy walks through in the background and makes a lewd hip 
humping gesture at the TV camera.

INT.  KITCHEN

Jody's mom can't believe what she's seeing on the news.

EXT.  HOUSE

Jody walks in the back door.

INT.  KITCHEN

Her mom flips off the TV AS Jody enters the kitchen.

                  JODY
              Hi mom.

                   MARGE
              Hi princess.

                   JODY
              Mom?

                   MARGE
              Yes?

                  JODY
             I need to ask you something.

                   MARGE
             You can ask me anything.

                  JODY
             Have you ever heard of someone
             named Lisa Sherman?

Mom's cutting hand starts to shake. She pretends that she doesn't know who 
Lisa Sherman is but she obviously does.

                   MARGE
             Lisa Sherman?

                   JODY
             Yeah. Who is she?

                   MARGE
             I don't know. Where did you
             hear that name.

                   JODY
             I overheard daddy mentioning
             her to someone. I he thinks she's the
             killer.

                  MARGE
             What?
     
                  JODY
             That's what he said.

                  MARGE
             Did he say anything else about her?

                   JODY
             No but he got really weird.
             Like I've never seen him act.
             REALLY angry and super uptight.

                   MARGE
                (lying)
             I've never heard of her.
             Maybe something else was on
             his mind.

                   JODY
             No. I think she lived her a
             long time ago. Like twenty-eight
             years ago. When dad was eighteen.

                  MARGE
             Not that I know of.

Jody is suspicious. Jody thinks for a moment, then picks her coat back up.

                  MARGE
             Where are you going?

                   JODY
             The library. I'll be fine.

Jody heads out the door. Her mother goes to the window, very concerned and 
watches her ride away. She picks up the phone.

INT.  POLICE STATION - BRENT'S OFFICE

BRENT is on the phone. His deputy is with him.

                  BRENT
           What's the address?
           Thanks.

He hangs up the phone.

                  DEPUTY
           You found her?

                  BRENT
           There's a Lisa Shermer living just sixty
           miles west of here. Over the Indiana border.
           I'm going.

                 DEPUTY
           We need you here. I can bring her in.

                 BRENT
           No. I'll handle this.

INT. STATION

Brent and the deputy head into the main station area. Brent grabs his gun. 
The DESK SERGEANT is on the phone.

                 DESK SERGEANT
           Sir, we're getting calls from other
           towns. Boys throughout the country have
           heard about what's going on here and they're
           heading our way, apparently, looking for girls.

                 BRENT
           Put a squad car at every entrance to town.

The desk sergeant picks up another call.

                  SERGEANT
           Your wife's on line three.

                 BRENT
           I can't talk to her now.

                  SERGEANT
           There's a problem with Jody.

                 BRENT
           Tell her she has to handle it.

He heads outside.

EXT.  POLICE STATION

The deputy walks Brent to his car.

                 DEPUTY
            As bizarre as it may sound,
            seems someone is planning to
            have a big party tonight.

                 BRENT
            No?

                  DEPUTY
           Should we close down any eruption?

                 BRENT
           Are you sure?

                 DEPUTY
           We're seeing all the signs in town.

                 BRENT
           I like the idea of all the kids in
           one place. If it happens, just keep
           a man outside until you hear from me.
           I'll be back in a couple of hours.

He jumps in his car and speeds away.

EXT.  LIBRARY

The gray old ivy-covered town library. Jody rides up and heads inside.

INT.  LIBRARY

Jody enters the vast library. It's empty. Almost spooky. A seventy year 
old lady, MISS DUNLOP is behind the desk, robotically stamping the back 
flaps of books.

                 MISS DUNLOP
           Hi Jody. What can I DO for you?

                  JODY
           Hi Miss Dunlop. Where do you keep
           the old town papers?

                  MISS DUNLOP
           They're all on microfiche.
           What year are you looking for?

                 JODY
           Twenty eight years ago.

                 MISS DUNLOP
           Follow me.

INT.  LIBRARY - UPSTAIRS

They head up the stairs and into the microfilm room.

                 JODY
           This place is empty.

                MISS DUNLOP
           Everyone's getting ready for the party.

                 JODY
           You heard about that?

                MISS DUNLOP
           Of course. NO ONE EVER SHUTS UP
           IN THE LIBARY. Kids were whispering
           about it all day.

                JODY
           Don't you think it's sick?

                 MISS DUNLOP
           Not at all. In fact, I thought
           about going.

                JODY
           You Miss Dunlop?

She hands Jody the microfiche.

                MISS DUNLOP
           Unfortunately I qualify.
           Think I'm too old?
          
                JODY
              (lying)
           No.

               MISS DUNLOP
           You're sweet. I really wish
           someone had thrown a party          
           like that when I was your age.           
           My life might have been very
           different.

SHE SLOWLY HEADS DOWN THE STAIRS.

INT.  LIBRARY - MICROFICHE ROOM

The newspaper headlines from 1970 pass by.

Jody is watching them flash by.

She slows down, then goes back. She's found what she's looking for.

A picture of LISA SHERMAN. It's her yearbook picture. She looks eerily 
identical to the picture that Jody drew. The headline reads 'High School 
Senior Attacked In park'.

Jody hears footsteps coming up the stairs. She looks up. The footsteps  
stop.

The old library is still. She senses that someone is watching her.

                  JODY
             (a little scared)
           Is that you Miss Dunlop?

No answer. She hears a bit of rustling from behind one of the shelves of 
books directly behind her.

A book accidentally drops to the ground.

She realizes that someone is right there, watching her.

                  JODY
           Who's there?

She sees a pair of shoes behind the book shelf but she can't see the face. 
The shoes start around the book shelf, toward her.

Jody leaps to her feet, ready to run. Her mom appears.

                  JODY
           Mom? You were spying on me.

Mom looks at the monitor, at the picture of Lisa Sherman's face.

                  MARGE
           I want you to come home with
           me right now, Jody.

                  JODY
           Who is she?

                 MARGE
           She's nobody you should be concerned
           with.

                  JODY
           Whoever tried to kill me
           was made up to look exactly 
           like this picture of Lisa Sherman,
           clothes and all. I think that
           concerns me.

                 MARGE
           Don't make me order you.

Jody sits back down.

                 JODY
           You going to drag me out and me in my
           room until I go to college?

Marge sits down next to Jody and takes her hand.

                 MARGE
           If I have to. Please
           let me protect you.

Jody is at a crossroads. Jody doesn't know what to do. Her mother hugs 
her, puts her arm around her, and almost lifts her out of her seat. She 
leads her down the stairs, away from the old newspaper.

INT.  LIBRARY

Jody's mom leads her across the vast hallway. They come to the door 
leading out of the library. Jody stops and looks back. She sees the old 
spinster Miss Dunlop, stacking the books.

                  JODY
           Wait.
     
                  MARGE
           What?

                  JODY
             (asserting herself)
           I'm not leaving. I want to
           know why you and dad are
           so freaked out. Three of my
           classmates are dead.

Mom doesn't like this at all.

CUT TO:

EXT.  LIBRARY

A beautiful garden on the edge of the library. The autumn wind is blowing. 
The leaves are at the height of foliage. Jody and her mom are seated on a  
carved stone bench.

                  MARGE
           Years ago, something horrible
           happened in this town. When I
           was still in high school. A girl
           named Elizabeth Sherman was attacked by
           four drunken seniors.

                   JODY
           Attacked how?

                  MARGE
           She was raped. At least that's
           what she claimed.

                  JODY
           You didn't believe her?

                  MARGE
               (confessing)
           No, I believed her. She was in
           pretty bad shape. Inside and out.
           But the boys were never formally
           charged.

                   JODY
           Why not?

                   MARGE
           They were children of our leading
           citizens, stars of the football team.
           And she was  a loner. An angry girl
           that no one really liked. She'd called
           them 'queers'.

                  JODY
           People thought these guys had a
           right to rape her because she called
           them 'queers'?

                  MARGE
           They were proving to her they weren't.
           They were very drunk. Things were different
           back then. You think kids are sexually
           bottled up today....

                  JODY
           And the police did nothing?

                   MARGE
           EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.

                   JODY
           How could you?

                   MARGE
            I don't know. We just did. I guess
           I was kind of scared going against the gain.
           Against the whole town.

                   JODY
          The word is Mob.

                   MARGE
           I've regretted it ever since.
           Never run with the herd just because
           they're the herd.

                  JODY
           Who were they?

Marge freezes. She didn't want to be asked that.

                   MARGE
           Who?

                   JODY
           The men. Do any of them still
           live around here?

                  MARGE
           Two men left town right after
           it happened.

                  JODY
           You're not telling me something.

Marge takes a deep breath, unsure what to say.

                  MARGE
            Mr. Sisler was one of them.

                  JODY
                (shocked)
             The principal?

                  MARGE
            Yes.

                  JODY
            Who was the fourth?

Marge is stricken. She looks down.

                   MARGE
            God. It's like everything that was
            ever repressed in this town is suddenly
            bubbling up through the ground.

Jody gets it.

                  JODY
            Dad?

Her mother can't deny it any longer.

                  JODY(CONT'D)
              (horrified)
           THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first.
           He was one of them.

                  MARGE
           Not a day has gone by where your     
             father has not torn himself to shreds
           for what happened. We both have...

                  JODY
           NO!

Jody gets up.
                  MARGE
           He dedicated his life to law
           enforcement after...

Jody runs off, very upset.

EXT.  LIBRARY

Jody jumps on her bicycle and speeds off.

EXT.  GARDEN

Marge sits down and stares straight ahead, crushed.

EXT.  INDIANA DIRT ROAD

The rusty old mailbox on the forgotten dirt road reads 'Lisa Sherman'
Brent's police car turns into the driveway.

INT.  CAR

Brent pulls up to the house. he sits and stares for a moment.

EXT.  LISA SHERMAN'S HOUSE

It's a dilapidated old house, uncared for, overgrown, a 'For Sale' sign 
stands crookedly in the front yard.

Brent gets out of the car and heads to the front door, stepping over rusty 
tools and old auto parts.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Brent lifts his hand and is about to knock. He can't. He walks around in a 
circle, composing himself, preparing himself to face Lisa Sherman after 
all these years. He draws the gun from his holster and knocks.

No one answers.

He knocks again.

No one answers, again.

A WOMAN, THE CARETAKER, appears from the side of the house.

                  CARETAKER
                Hello?

                  BRENT
                I'm looking for Lisa Sherman.

                  CARETAKER
                She's not here.

                  BRENT
               You know where I can find her?

                  CARETAKER
               St. Michael's.

                  BRENT
               She works at a church?

                  CARETAKER
               She resides there. Out back.
               She died a year and a half ago.

Brent feels terribly guilty about what he did to Lisa Sherman, but also 
terribly relieved that he'll never have to face her. It's been a  long 
time since he's confronted his hidden past. He puts his gun away.

                   BRENT
              Of what?

                  CARETAKER
              A bullet to the right cerebellum.

                   BRENT
              She was murdered?

                  CARETAKER
              No. She ate a pistol for lunch
              one day.

Brent can't help but feel responsible.

                   BRENT
              Can you describe her? How old
              was she?

                    CARETAKER
              I never met the woman. I'm just taking
              care of the place until they sell it.

                   BRENT
              Can you get inside?

                   CARETAKER
              I can.

                   BRENT
             I knew Lisa Sherman long ago.
             It's extremely important that I
             get inside and try to verify that it's the
             same woman who lived here.

                   CARETAKER
             I don't give a fuck what your reasons
             are. You pay me ten dollars, you can go inside
             Otherwise, get a warrant.

He pulls out his wallet.

EXT.  KENNY'S HOUSE

Jody rides up to Kenny's house.

INT.  HOUSE

Kenny sees her from his bedroom window.

INT.  FRONT HALLWAY

Kenny comes tearing downstairs.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR

Kenny, opens the front door, very excited.

                   KENNY
               Jody!
               (he kisses her)
               Yes! You're here.

Jody wipes a tear from her eye. Kenny notices how upset she is.

                  KENNT(CONT'D)
              What's the matter?

Jody bursts into tears. She hugs him. He hugs her back and leads her 
inside.

INT.  HOUSE

An old rundown house. The clutter smells. Whoever lived here had little to 
no self respect. Garbage is piled up in every corner, order is nowhere. 
Brent is repulsed by what he sees. he wasn't expecting such chaos. He 
knows he helped create this mess.

                   BRENT
             Is there a picture of her somewhere?

                   CARETAKER
             No pictures. No mirrors.
             Was she a crazy woman when
             you knew her?

                    BRENT
             (feeling very guilty)
             No.

                    CARETAKER
             Couldn't tell she going to off
             herself, huh?

                    BRENT
             No, you couldn't.

                    CARETAKER
            I've been in a lot of people's
            houses and this one's the creepiest.

                    BRENT
            Really?

                    CARETAKER
            Yeah. You should check downstairs.

                    BRENT
            Why?

                    CARETAKER
           People always keep their secrets in their
           attics or in their basements. All the 
           weirdness in this house took place in the
           basement.

The woman flips on the basement light. There are several locks on the 
door. Brent is very scared of what he's going to find down there.

INT.  BASEMENT

Brent steps down into the basement.

It is a combination prison/bedroom. It looks like it hasn't been cleaned 
in years. Water drips for the ceiling. Rat traps are everywhere. Old 
broken child's TOYS are stacked in one corner below some handcuffs which 
are bolted into the wall above a cot. The cot is small, the mattress 
rotted. Old shit lies dried on the floor piss stains line every wall.

Huge nails and odd iron objects sit in one corner.

Brent walks over to the dresser and looks in it. He pulls out a pair of 
grown man's trousers. He examines them.

                  CARETAKER
           They look like they'd fit you.
           Three bucks.

Brent things for a moment then throws the pants down. He darts back up the 
stairs. The caretaker laughs.

INT.  KENNY'S

Jody and Kenny are in Kenny's bedroom, sitting on his bed.

                   KENNY
            All our parents are weirdoes.
            I think my dad is into hookers.
            I know he lit cats on fire when
            he was a kid.

                   JODY
              (all wound up)
           My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking
           Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking
           Rapist.

                   KENNY
             (compassionately)
           I think this is a big part of growing up.
           It's losing your spiritual virginity.
           It's when you finally discover that your
           parents aren't anything they told you they
           were. They're even bigger hypocrites than     
           your friends.

                   JODY
           I can't believe I listened to one word of
           his shit.

                   KENNY
           But if he'd been sent to jail,
           there would be no Jody.

                   JODY
           So I should feel happy that he got
           away with it?

                   KENNY
           I don't know. I kind of am.

Jody, still crying, stares at Kenny for a second then leans in and kisses 
him with everything she's got, Ready for action.

                   KENNY
           Are you coming to the party?

                   JODY
           Let's just start a party right here,
           right fucking now.

Jody quickly takes her own shirt off, rips off his, and pounces on him. 
He's taken aback by her sudden aggressiveness. He has no idea how to 
respond to it.

INT.  TOWN HALL

Brent comes storming out of the hall of records.

INT.  PHONE BOOTH

Frantic dialing. Brent is on the phone.

INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

The phone rings. The answering machine picks up.

                   BRENT
                (leaving a message)
           Tom? Lisa Sherman is dead. But you'll
           never believe what I found out. Meet
           me at the Roadhouse on Route nine in a
           half hour. We need to talk in private.

As Brent finishes his message the camera moves across the principal's 
desk, first revealing a few blood drops on a piece of paper and then the 
killer's hand, holding the razor. The killer has been listening to the 
message.

Tom, the principal, is sitting in the corner in  a large puddle of his own 
blood, tied to the radiator. He's barely alive. His tongue has been cut 
out, his foot cut off at the ankle and shoved into his mouth. One eye is 
missing, the other one has been left in only so that Tom can look into the 
killer's face as he's tortured.

The razor blade is lifted off the table.

Tom braces himself, gripping his hands, preparing for more pain.

The camera moves back to the phone as we hear Tom gag and then the killer 
walking out of the room.

INT.  KENNY'S

Jody is all over Kenny. He's really weirded out by her aggressiveness.  
She reaches for his crotch and finds that he's soft. She rolls over, 
embarrassed.

                  JODY
                (worried)
            What's wrong? Am I doing something
            wrong?

                   KENNY
            Just making me feel like a piece
            of meat.

                  JODY
           I'm making you feel like meat?

                  KENNY
           Yeah.

Jody rolls over, a bit pissed off and very confused.

                  JODY
           You break up with me because
           I won't fuck you.

                  KENNY
           That's not why we broke up.

                  JODY
           You flaunt some slut in my face.

                  KENNY
           Sharon's far from a slut.

                   JODY
           And when I finally agree to spread
           my legs, you accuse me of treating
           you like meat.

                  KENNY
           Jody, you're only doing this to
           get back at your dad. It doesn't
           have that much to do with me.

She gets up angry, and starts putting her clothes back on. That was the 
wrong note to play. The truth hurts.

                  KENNY
           Please don't go. Please.
           Stay, We'll just talk. Then
           go to the party.

                  JODY
           This party is sick.

She heads to the door.

                  KENNY
           Jody. Wait.

                  JODY
           What?

                  KENNY
           I'm scared. Three kids are
           dead. I want to go to this
           party.

                  JODY
           Then go to the party. Run
           with the herd Kenny. Just
           don't spew out all that 'be
           an individual, assert yourself'
           crap anymore.

She heads out, very upset.

INT.  DRUG STORE

INSERT- A condom slides across the counter. The register rings it up.

A teenage boy is standing there buying the condom. The camera pulls back 
to reveal another teenage boy behind him, also holding a condom and then 
another and another. All told, the store is completely jam packed with 
over a hundred boys, all standing in line, all buying condoms.

INT.  BEDROOM

Sandy is getting ready to go to the party, making herself look as hot as 
possible, and she looks hot. There's a knock on the door. She's scared to 
answer it, considering how she's dressed. Her dad comes in and sits on the 
bed. Sandy turns away from and buttons her top shirt button up.

                    DAD
              I know where you're going.

                     SANDY
                  (concerned)
              
              You do?

                     DAD
              Your brother told us.

                    SANDY
              Daddy....

                    DAD
             Shh. I'm not going to tell
             you not to go.

                    SANDY
             You're not?

                   DAD
             No. I couldn't do that.
             I have something for you.

He places something on her dresser, smiles at her, and leaves.

She looks at what he's left. It's a condom.

             Lisa, I'm so sorry.

Sandy appears at the top of the stairs, decked out, ready for the party. 
Her mom bursts into tears. Sandy heads toward the front door. her father 
walks up to her and hugs her. Her brother Andy, smirks in the b.g.

Mom cries harder.

                  ANDY
             Just think of it like she's having
             a flu shot. Purely preventive.

pillows, sheets, blankets, anything and everything that will make the wood 
floors more comfortable.

One couple runs towards the front door howling.

Another boy pulls his obviously frightened girlfriend into the house, 
reassuring her that everything will be fine.

Lots of kids are milling around outside because two big football players 
and their dates are guarding the front door. There's a big sign that says 
"Couples only". Lots of hooking up is taking place on the front lawn.

EXT.  NEIGHBOR'S YARD

Two computer nerds are hidden behind a tree, watching the other kids 
arrive. They spot the two homely girls we saw earlier.

                  NERD 1
            There's Jan and Heather.
            Let's grab them quick before
            someone else does.

                NERD 2
            Ok.

                NERD 1
            Hide your laptop here.

                 NERD 2
            No.

                NERD 1
           You can't bring it.

                NERD 2
           I'm not leaving it here.

Nerd 2 heads toward the girls, taking his laptop. Nerd 1 follows, pissed 
off. They walk up near the homely girls and make eye contact. After 
several uncomfortable moments, someone shouts for an upper window.

                GIRL IN WINDOW
           Marisa! Find someone fast.
           Floor space is almost gone.

This only heightens the uncomfortable ness outside. One of the homely 
girls looks at the laptop.

                 NERD 2
            Ever play QUAKE?

                 HOMELY GIRL 2
           What's that?

                 NERD 2
           A computer game.

The four just gravitate toward each other, now 'coupled'. They enter the 
house next to each other, all four terrified, none even acknowledging yet 
that they're all in danger.

INT.  CAR

Ben and Cindy arrive.

                 CINDY
               (finalizing)
            I get all your CDs.

                  BEN
            Not my imports.

                 CINDY
            Ok not your imports. All
            your other CDS and your
            K2 snowboard.

                 BEN
           That's an awful lot for ten
           minutes of beasting?

                 CINDY
           Don't flatter yourself.
           You'll be lucky to last
           ten seconds with me Ben.

She kisses him passionately, and gets out of the car. He follows her, 
smitten, like a puppy dog.

INT.  HOUSE

Kids file through the house, creating floor space, moving furniture, 
piling it high.

A keg of beer flows in the corner.

Rock n' Roll blares from all directions. Everyone's excited.

CUT TO:

EXT. STREET

Jody rides down the street, just pedaling fast, as fast as she can.
She's in her own world, very upset.

A car comes toward the intersection on the other street but doesn't slow 
down, knowing the light is about to change.

A boy in a passing car whistles at Jody, waking her out of her stupor.  
Jody looks up just as the light turns red. She hits her brakes and skids 
into the tail of the oncoming car. She glances off it and goes sliding off 
the road, into a few garbage cans.

The car nicks another car and pulls over.

Across the street, we see that the Killer's IMPERIAL is stopped at the red 
light.

Jody gets up, shaken. He knees and elbows are badly scratched.

The OWNER of the car comes running over to Jody.

                 OWNER
            Are you O.K.?

                  JODY
            I'm ok.

                 CAR OWNER
            Are you sure?

                   JODY
            Yes.

                  LEONARD(O.C.)
           You don't look OK.

Jody turns around. Her teacher Leonard Marliston is there. The killer's 
IMPERIAL is parked behind him. Jody wipes away the tears.

                  JODY
              (starting to cry)
           I am.

                LEONARD
           My house is just a couple of blocks
           away. Why don't you come on over and
           clean those cuts up.

                JODY
           Ok. Should I put my bike in the back
           of your car?

                LEONARD
           Can you just follow me?
           The back is full?

                 JODY
           Sure.

CUT TO:

EXT.  PARTY HOUSE

Kids are still arriving from all over but there's no more room in the 
house so the party starts spilling out into the backyard.

One couple spreads out on the roof.

A cop car has pulled up in front and the deputy is just keeping a watch on 
the house.
          
EXT.  TOWN SQUARE

Kids are starting to gather and hook up in the town square. As the police 
try to break up one gathering, another one starts.

CUT TO:

INT.  CAR

Leonard drives down the road. He smiles into his rear view mirror.

EXT.  STREET

In Leonard's rear view mirror we see Jody pedaling behind him.

A couple of boys lean out of their cars and invite Jody to the go to the 
party. Sirens scream out in the distance.

EXT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE

Leonard pulls into his driveway. Jody pulls in behind. She leans the bike 
on the front porch and they head into the house.

                  LEONARD
            You aren't going to the party?

                  JODY
            You know about that too?

INT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE

Mr. Leonard opens the door to his house. Jody walks in behind him.

     
                  LEONARD
            of COURSE. You're not scared?

                  JODY
            Of course I'm scared.

                  LEONARD
            Then you should go.

                  JODY
            You think I should go to
            the party, Mr. Marliston?

                  LEONARD
            I really do. For your own
            safety.

Jody doesn't know what to make of this. It's not what she expected to hear 
from her teacher.

Leonard goes into the kitchen. Jody sits on the couch and looks around. 
She's immediately sensing that something is off about the place. It's 
certainly not the way she imagined a teacher's house to look. It has all 
sorts of city plans, maps, and drawings on the walls. Years of Cherry 
Falls yearbooks and newspapers are stacked in piles.

He reappears with two beers and a pot filled with soapy water. He hands 
her a beer.

                  JODY
            I just feel so manipulated.
            By everyone. My dad, my boyfriend,
            and now some psychopath I don't
            even know.

SHE TAKES THE BEER, surprised he's giving her alcohol. He kneels down in 
front of her and begins to clean the wound on her leg.

                  LEONARD
            We're all manipulated. From the moment
            we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped
            my life happened before I was even born.

                  JODY
            Really?

                  LEONARD
            Yes. We have no real freedom.
            You of all people should understand
            that. This may sting.

Jody is beginning to feel strange. There's something off kilter about this 
whole encounter.

                  JODY
            Me? Why me?

                  LEONARD
             Because of your father.
            The way what his sins shaped you.

He starts putting a disinfectant on her wound.

                  JODY
            What do you know about my father?

                  LEONARD
            He's a rapist. Like mine.

She grimaces. The disinfectant hurts.

                  JODY
                (a little scared)_
            Your father raped someone?

                  LEONARD
            Lisa Sherman was my mother.
            Do you know who that is?

                   JODY
            Yes.

                  LEONARD
           I was born nine months after she was
           raped. One of the four men who raped
           her is my father. I have no idea which one.

                  JODY
           You're the killed.

                 LEONARD
           Yes that's the whole point. This is
           what I was put on this earth to do.
           Rape the town that raped my mother.
           Steal its pristine innocence like it
           stole hers. I've planned this since I was
           a very little boy. You have no real freedom
           either. Your father has cast a shadow that
           you've never eluded.

Jody gets up and starts backing away from him but he gets up quickly. He's 
not letting her get away.

Jody bolts for the door but she doesn't have time to open it.

Leonard grabs her and throws her across the room.

Jody smashes into a  table. He bends down to pick her up, but she pulls a 
book case over on him, narrowly escaping.

She runs for the back door.

INT.  BACK DOOR

Jody opens the back door and gets halfway out when Leonard runs up to her, 
pulls her away from the door, and slugs her in the face, sending her 
sprawling to the ground. He picks her up and punches her a second time, 
breaking her nose, knocking her half out. He picks her up by the waist and 
carries her to the basement stairs.

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRS

Leonard throws Jody down into the dark basement. She tumbles down the 
stairs, hitting her head on the cold stone floor.

He comes charging down after her, closing the door behind them.

CUT TO:

INT.  PARTY HOUSE

The CD is now skipping. Kids are in every corner, bed , and closet, making 
out. Every square inch of the house is being taken as the party shifts 
into higher gear. It's a sea of sheets and blankets rippling with bodies 
under them. Giggles and moans are heard every second.

INT.  A CLOSET

Sandy and Mark are gently kissing in the closet, still standing up. Mark 
studies Sandy's face for a second, then slowly lifts her dress, sliding 
his hand on to her thighs.

                    MARK
             You're so beautiful.

                   SANDY
            So are you.

                   MARK
            Now don't be nervous.

                   SANDY
            You're the one who's hand is shaking.

Mark smiles, embarrassed. They kiss. They're falling in love.

ECU - ELECTRONIC beeps come off a computer screen as a warrior armed with 
a huge plasma gun fights his way into a dark cave, shooting plasma 
everywhere.

The nerds and the homely girls are in the corner playing the computer 
game, ALL SCARED TO MAKE a move. People around them are shushing them as 
they blow up monster. One guy finally has had it. H gets up, grabs the 
laptop and tosses it out the window. NERD 2 IS PISSED OFF.

                  NERD 2
            Hey! That was a 3k machine.

                  NERD 1
            Told you to hide it.

Homely girl 2 starts to laugh. It was kind of funny. Then they all start 
to laugh, even NERD 2. There's nothing left to do but laugh. Except kiss. 
And that they do.

INT.  BEDROOM

Cindy and Ben are naked under a blanket in the corner.

                  BEN
             One more time.

                  CINDY
                (negotiating)
             I get the imports.

                  BEN
             Ok!

He's all over her. She's into it too.

INT.  BEDROOM

Sharon turns up the heat on Kenny, running her hands across his bare 
chest. Kenny breaks off the kiss, not really into it.

                  SHARON
             You ok?

                  KENNY
            Just thinking about something.

                   SHARON
            What?

                  KENNY
            There's going to be very few
            virgins left in school on Monday.
            It could be really dangerous for them
            if the killer isn't caught.

                 SHARON
            I guess so. Luckily we won't have
            that problem.

She kisses him again. He stops her again, buttons his shirt.

                 SHARON
            What are you doing?

                 KENNY
            I got to go.

                 SHARON
            What?

                 KENNY
            I'm worried about someone.

He puts his clothes on.

                 SHARON
             You can't just leave me here.

                 BOY'S VOICE
            Stay put Sharon. I'll hop on over
            when I'm done here.

                GIRL'S VOICE
            You will not!

Others laugh. Kenny looks around.

                 KENNY
            Jody was right, this party IS sick.

Kenny buttons his shirt and heads out. Sharon is pissed.

CUT TO:

INT.  BASEMENT               

As Jody comes to, she finds herself gagged, tied to a chair in the dark 
basement. She can't see much but she can hear the sounds of water dripping 
and a rat scurrying around. She tips her chair over and falls onto the 
cold floor. She tries to removes her gag by rubbing her head against the 
ground.

EXT.  LEONARD'S HOUSE

Leonard goes to his station wagon and opens the back.

INT.   CAR

A body is hidden under a blanket. Leonard picks it up. It's too heavy.

INT.   BASEMENT

Jody can't undo her gag but she notices a piece of glass under a dresser. 
She turns herself around to grab for it.

She squeezes her hand under the dresser, reaching for the shard.

The door at the top of the stairs opens.

Leonard appears in silhouette carrying the body wrapped in a blanket. He 
throws it down the stairs and turns the lights on.

The basement is almost an exact replication of the basement in his 
mother's house. A cot in the same spot. The dresser as well. The Lisa 
Sherman costume is neatly hung from big metal hooks.

Leonard sits Jody back up.

A little blood drips from Jody's closed hands. She has the shard.

Leonard ties the other body to a chair facing Jody. He starts singing SLY 
AND THE FAMILY STONE.

                  LEONARD
                (singing)
             'It's a family affair,
             It's a family affair.'

He undoes the blanket revealing the battered but still breathing body of 
Jody's dad. Brent's bleeding from the forehead, nose, and mouth. He's 
badly beaten up.

Jody gags on her gag. Her dad looks her in the eye.

                   LEONARD
             Well, we may be family
             One in four chance.

Leonard picks up his razor and starts towards Jody.

                   LEONARD
             Sheriff Brent, you will be the
             second of the four horsemen of
             the apocalypse to die. But first you
             will watch as I slice up your little
             girl.

Brent starts frantically shaking no, trying to escape as Leonard kneels in 
front of Jody and runs his hands up under her dress, exposing her shaved, 
nubile leg. The 'V' is still fresh in her calf.

Leonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it.

Jody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to 
shake.          

                    LEONARD
           You're shaking too much.
           If you don't stop shaking Jody,
           I'll have to kill before I carve.
           We wouldn't want that.

Jody concentrates on trying to show no pain, not to flinch. It's tough. 
Her father watches, 
horrified.

Cut to:

EXT.  STREET

Kenny runs down the street, heading toward Jody's house. He stops to catch 
his breath for a second.
He notices something.

EXT.  LEONARD'S

Jody's bicycle is still leaning against Leonard's porch.

EXT.  STREET

Kenny crosses the street to Leonard's house and inspects the bicycle. It's 
hers.

INT.  BASEMENT

Leonard continues to work on Jody's bare leg, starting the 'R'. Jody and 
her father stare at each other, helplessly.

                  LEONARD
           My mother said, after you and your
           three droogs raped her Brent, that people
           in town refused to let her use their bathrooms.
           Is that true? Did people really call her a slut
           and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to
           snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least
           in my direction, was snarl. When she looked at me, 
           she saw only you.

Jody gags in pain. Brent looks away.

                   LEONARD
            Open your eyes Brent. Watch. Or
            will I cause her much more pain.

Brent opens his eyes. More blood drips. Jody starts to lose consciousness, 
barely able to stand it 
anymore. The doorbell rings. Leonard looks up, concerned.

EXT.  HOUSE

Kenny rings it again. No one answers.

He walks over to the window and looks through a crack underneath the 
curtains.

INT.  HOUSE

Kenny's POV - Jody's coat and purse are still on the couch.

EXT.  HOUSE

Kenny senses that something is really off. He rings again but no one 
answers.  Worried, he pops the screen. It's breaking and entering time.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Kenny climbs into the living room and looks around.

                    KENNY
              Hello? Jody?

INT.   BASEMENT

Leonard hears Kenny. He can't ignore him any longer.

                     LEONARD
             Who the fuck is breaking into my house?

Leonard checks Jody's and Brent's ropes are tight, then heads up the 
stairs. As soon as he disappears, Jody wriggles toward her father and 
starts cutting his ropes with the shard of glass.

INT.    HOUSE

Leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room.

INT.    LIVING ROOM

Leonard sees Kenny opening Jody's purse, checking it out.

Leonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back.

                       LEONARD
              My wallet's on the mantle
              when you've finished your rifling,
              Kenny.

Kenny looks up, startled.

                       KENNY
                   (nervously)
              Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What's Jody's
              bike doing on your front porch?

                       LEONARD
             That all depends Kenny. Depends on why
             the FUCK you've broken into your history
             teacher's house?

                      KENNY
            Alright, Marliston, I know she's here.
            
                       LEONARD
            What are you talking about? No one here
            but us chickens.

INT.  BASEMENT 

Jody cuts through her dad's ropes. Her dad immediately takes Jody's gag 
off.

INT.  LIVING ROOM

Kenny heads out the door.

                      JODY(O.C.)
             Help!

Kenny hears the cry and turns around.

                      KENNY
             That was Jody!

Leonard says nothing. He just stares at Kenny.

                      JODY(O.C.)
             Somebody help!

Kenny heads toward the basement door to investigate. Brent starts kicking 
on the other side of the locked door.

                      KENNY
              Jody?!

Leonard moves towards Kenny with the razor. Kenny turns just in time.  He 
grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle.

The door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open 
from the other side.

Leonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the 
head. Kenny falls to the ground.

The door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes 
him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard 
screams, and lunges at Brent.

Brent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard 
down the basement stairs.

Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the 
bottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent 
smashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He 
raises the razor and slits Brent across the face.

                    BRENT
               Jody run!

Jody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg.

Instinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody. 
Leonard slashes Brent across the face again.

                      JODY
               No!

                      BRENT
                   (dying)
              Run!

Jody crawls to the top of the stairs.  Leonard does everything he can to 
get away from Brent but Brent hangs on.  Jody watches, horrified, at the 
top of the stair. Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody 
away from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body 
open. Brent rolls over, a bloody mess.

INT.  TOP OF STAIRS

Kenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs. Kenny holds 
the door shut with all his might.

                    JODY
               My dad's down there!

                     KENNY
              He's dead! We've got to
              get the fuck out of here!

Kenny pushes a dresser in front of it, trapping Leonard.

                     JODY
              I can't walk. I think he cut right
              through a tendon.

Leonard starts chopping through the door with an axe.

Kenny helps Jody out the front door.

                  KENNY
             Deputy Webber's at the party.
             It's only three blocks away.

Leonard's car squeals around the corner behind them.

                   JODY
              Fuck! It's him.

INT.  CAR

Leonard steps on the gas.

Kenny peddles as fast as he can, going up onto the sidewalk but that 
doesn't stop Leonard. He comes screeching up on the sidewalk right behind 
Kenny, ready to run him over.

Kenny tears up onto a lawn, Leonard follows him, grass spewing up 
everywhere.

Kenny cuts hard between two trees and back onto the street. He heads onto 
the other sidewalk. LEONARD remains in pursuit, knocking into several 
cars, flattening several fences, and mutilating a cat along the way.

Leonard gains on them as they zigzag up and down the pristine street, 
destroying it.

Leonard pulls up right behind them. He hits the gas. Kenny has to turn

door towards them, barking and snarling.

                      KENNY
                 Shit.

Kenny helps Jody over the fence, then leaps up on it just as the German 
Shepard snaps at
him.

He jumps down on the other side, safe.

The German Shepard smells something else and tears away.

EXT.  FRONT OF HOUSE

Leonard gets out of his car and takes a step toward the house when the 
German Shepard comes charging out the open fence.  Leonard screams. The 
dog pounces on him, starts humping his leg. Leonard rolls his eyes. The 
dog thrusts away.

CLOSE ON THE RAZOR. Leonard raises the razor, contemplates, then rolls his 
eyes. He pushes the dog off of him.  It lets out a panted growl, almost 
like it's saying 'going so soon lover boy?' Leonard hops back in his car, 
speeds off down the street. The dog barks wildly up at the night sky. Talk 
about being left with a hard-on.

EXT.  PARTY HOUSE

The house is dark. The lights are all out.

EXT.   ROAD

The deputy checks his watch. A policeman comes running up.

                     POLICEMAN
                 We just found another body.

                     DEPUTY
                Who's?

                     POLICEMAN
                Tom Sisler. He was murdered at school.
                 Two kids went into his office to fuck and
                they found him, with his tongue cut out and
                his foot jammed into his mouth. Killer also
                chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his
                pencil holder.

                    DEPUTY
                 Jesus. Any word from Brent?

                     POLICEMAN
               Nope. The switchboard is lightning up downtown.
                Kids from other towns are starting to congregate
                in the parks and at the high school. It's turning
               into WOODSTOCK except there's no concert.

                    DEPUTY
               Call Brent on the horn. See where he is. What
                he wants us to do. I'll head over to the school.

                    POLICEMAN
               Ok.

The deputy jumps into his car.

                     DEPUTY
                Don't leave this party until you
                hear from me.

The policeman looks up at the house.

                     POLICEMAN
               But I shouldn't shut it down?

                     DEPUTY
               No. Hell, it's the quietest goddamn
               party I've ever seen.

EXT.  SUBURBAN STREET

Jody and Kenny climb over a fence into another backyard. Jody is limping 
badly.
Kenny is helping her along.

                     JODY
               Thanks for coming back for me.

                     KENNY
               I love you.

She kisses him. He kisses her back.

Leonard has pulled over down the street from the party.

EXT.   STREET

INT.   POLICE CAR

The officer sits in his car, trying to call Brent.

                      OFFICER
                 Brent?
                     (no answer)
                 Come in Brent.

There's a knock at the car window. The officer looks up, startled.

EXT.   CAR

Leonard is looking in the window.

INT.   CAR

The officer rolls down the window.

                       OFFICER
                 Jesus Christ had balls in his soup,
                 Marliston, what'd you do, eat out a
                 pizza or something? What the fuck 
                 happened to your face?

                       LEONARD
                 Hey, look, Elvis.

                       OFFICER
                 Where?

                       LEONARD
                 You really are a god damn rube.

Leonard slashes the officer's throat open in one savage swoop. He slumps 
over the steering wheel, throat cut beyond repair, blood squirting 
everywhere.

                       LEONARD
                     (humming)
                'Family affair. Oh yes it's a 
                 family affair'.

EXT.  PARTY

Jody and Kenny limp up to the party. There are no police outside.

                        JODY
                 Where are the police?

Jody looks down the road, lets out a blood curdling scream. LEONARD is 
slowly limping towards the house, gore dripping razor in hands.
     
                        JODY
                 Oh GOD IT'S HIM!

                        KENNY
                 Quick! In the house. He
                 won't look for us in there.

Kenny and Jody limp toward the front door.

INT.  PARTY HOUSE

Kenny and Jody limp through the front door. Couples are everywhere. 
There's no room
to even walk.

The party has reached it's 'climax'.

We see the faces of teenage boys and girls as they lose their virginity. 
They run the gamut of emotions. Some are terrified, some are ecstatic. 
Some are concentrating as hard as they've ever concentrated, some are 
closing their eyes, trying to fade out.

We see Sandy, Mark, Cindy, and Ben all having a blast. Sharon has managed 
to find a new partner and the nerds are riding the homely girls. It's 
orgiastic.

Kenny and Jody can only marvel at it as they limp through the maze of 
bodies looking for a place to hide.

KENNY GRABS  a sheet off the ground and carries Jody up the stairs.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM

Kenny carries Jody into the huge bedroom.

A couple of kids look up as the door opens. There must be over a 100 
teenagers in the room, adjoining bathroom, and closets. The room is just a 
sea of kids humping two deep, under blankets.

                     KID ON FLOOR
                 There's no room in here.
     
                     ANOTHER KID
                 Yeah. Get lost we're packed.

Kenny pays no attention to them. He shoves his way into a corner,  pissing 
off everyone on the way, stepping on a few hands and other appendages. He 
puts Jody down and starts unbuttoning her shirt.

                      JODY
                    (whispering)
                 What are you doing?

                      KENNY
                 Pretend we're just another couple.

He pulls her under the sheet.

INT.  PARTY - DOWNSTAIRS

Leonard comes in the front door, his razor in hand, the policeman's blood 
still dripping from it. He looks around, wondering if they're here.

No one seems to notice Leonard as he hunts for Jody and Kenny, walking 
through the sea of bodies, dripping blood on the backs of a couple of 
kids. A serial killer at a fuckfest.  Leonard smiles at the sight of all 
the teenagers copulating.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM

Kenny and Jody curl up next to each other. Kenny kisses her. She kisses 
him back.

They're into each other. They can't keep their hands off each other. They 
start to really make out.

INT.   PARTY DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM

Leonard moves into one of the bedrooms. He switches the lights on.

The kids look up pissed off. There's not an inch of floor space.

                     BOY
                Hey! Turn that off.

                     GIRL
                Mr. Marliston?!

                     LEONARD
                Hi Samantha. Excuse me.

He steps over a thrusting hairy ass, surveys the room.  No Kenny. No Jody.

                     GIRL
                    (freaked)
                What are you doing here?!

The girl breaks into orgasm before she can barely finish the sentence. 
Leonard
flips the lights off and heads out of the room. Through out the entire 
proceedings, everyone was fucking like no one entered the room. 
Homeostasis remains stable.

INT.  PARTY STAIRCASE

Leonard heads up the stairs, still looking for Kenny and Jody. A couple of 
kids
on the staircase notice him. He almost trips on one. They start whispering 
to each other, freaked out that a teacher is there. More and more kids 
start looking up The party has definitely been disturbed.

INT.   MASTER BEDROOM

Jody hears the disturbance. She stops Kenny and listens.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard checks another bedroom. He flips the lights on. No Jody, no Kenny. 
He leaves. More and more kids notice him.

INT.   MASTER BEDROOM

Jody and Kenny know he's close. Leonard appears in the doorway.

                      KENNY
                    (whispering)
                  It's him.

Leonard accidentally steps on a boy's hand as he enters the room. The boy, 
JIMMY, is pissed off.  He looks up and realizes who it is.

                      LEONARD
                 Pay no attention to me.

                      JIMMY
                 What are you doing here?

                      BOY ACROSS THE ROOM
                 He's looking to get laid.

                      JIMMY'S GIRLFRIEND
                Mr. Marliston?

She grabs her clothes, embarrassed. Jimmy gets up. He's very drunk. Kenny 
and Jody peek out from under their sheet.

                       JIMMY
                 You fucked me up!

                       LEONARD
                 What?

                       JIMMY
                 You gave me a 'D'.

                       LEONARD
                 I'm sure you should have failed.

                       JIMMY
                 I was grounded for two fucking
                 months because of you!

Jody knows her friend is in danger.

                       JODY
                 Jimmy leave him alone! He's
                 imbalanced.

Leonard sees Jody. He starts toward her but Jimmy stupidly jumps in his 
way.

                      LEONARD
                 Please get out of my way
                 or I'll have to hurt you.

                      JIMMY
                 I knew you were a pervert.
                 Always wearing those fucking doofy     
                 glasses, and driving a station wagon.

                      JODY
                 He's dangerous Jimmy!

                      JIMMY
                 So am I! I'm gonna rip your cock off
                  Marliston!

                      LEONARD
                 Touché'

Leonard winds back, slashes at Jimmy, lopping off his dick. Blood flies 
up, splatters across Jimmy's face. Jimmy screams. Leonard slashes open his 
neck. Blood splatters everywhere, on kid's backs, faces, butts.

His girlfriend screams as Jimmy falls to the ground, dying.

Leonard begins to panic. So do the kids. Leonard sees Jody across the room 
and starts toward her as the other kids in the room rise to their feet and 
stampede the fuck out of dodge like a herd of frightened elephants.

INT.  DIFFERENT BEDROOM

Kids in other rooms hear the commotion and break their embraces.

                    BOY(O.C.)
                Run! Mr. Marliston's here!
                And he's horny!

Panic sweeps through the whole party. Everyone wants out.

INT.  BEDROOM

Leonard can't get to Jody because too many kids are trying to get out the 
bedroom door, pushing toward it, sweeping him up in their flow. It has 
turned quickly into chaos with a teenage logjam at the door.

Leonard keeps his eyes pinned on Jody across the room, through the bodies. 
He can't make headway so he raises the razor to slash way to her. Jody 
sees him raise the razor.

                     JODY
                 No!

Leonard starts slashing his way toward Jody. He slashes a girl across the 
stomach, a boy across the face, a  girl across the breasts. It's a 
bloodbath, everyone's screaming.

KIDS' bodies fall to the ground, tripping people, creating even more 
chaos.

Leonard loses his balance and is pushed to the ground as kids stampede 
over him.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM

Jody and Kenny try to make it to the door.

Leonard tries to get up but he can't. He starts crawling toward Jody, 
slashing the legs of a couple of kids who are in his way, sending them to 
the ground. One kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, 
exploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat. Blood sprays across 
the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler.

Through the sea of legs, Leonard sees Jody's leg, the 'VIR' still freshly 
carved. He slashes his way towards Jody.

EXT.   HOUSE

Half naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight. 
Some of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung 
upside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled). The house is almost 
bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back.

INT.   STAIRWELL

Too many kids are trying to get out at one. The staircase and all the 
hallways start totally backed up but all the kids keep pushing forward. 
Something's got to give.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard keeps crawling toward Jody, getting closer and closer. He 
scrunches over Jimmy's severed penis, staining his khakis with gore.

                      LEONARD
                 Come on! These are eighty dollar
                 INDEPENDENT khakis! Limited Edition!     
                 God damn it!

INT.   STAIRWELL

The pushing continues. There's nowhere to go. A boy gets pushed over the 
balcony, falling to the ground below.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard is just a few feet from Jody's leg.

Jody and Kenny push closer to the door.

Leonard reaches for Jody's leg. He can't quite grab it.

Kenny and Jody reach the door. They're almost out. Leonard lungs and grabs
Jody's leg.

Jody screams out in pain, falls into the crowd.

                      JODY
                   Kenny!

Kenny tries to grab for her but he can't reach her. The force of the mob 
pushes him out the door, through the vortex.

INT.  UPSTAIRS

Kids jam the staircase. There's too many trying to get down at once. 
Everyone's
still pushing. The kids on the staircase can't keep their position and 
start falling forward, pushing harder.

INT.  BEDROOM

Leonard keeps hold of Jody's leg and pulls her toward him.

EXT.  BALCONEY

Kenny tries to get back to Jody but there's no way he can make headway 
back into that room.

                       KENNY
                    Jody?!

The staircase is now jammed with people, starts to buckle.

The banister breaks. Kids start falling off the balcony and staircase, 
onto kids below, CRACKING SKULLS, breaking bones.

INT.   DOWNSTAIRS

Lamps smash to the ground. Tables are trampled. Basically, the entire 
inside of the house is destroyed in the stampede which puts something out 
of fucking JUMANJI to shame.

INT.   BEDROOM

Leonard gets hold of Jody's waist and pulls her towards him, razor ready.

INT.   UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR

Everyone gives one final push out. Kenny is swept on to the staircase. It 
can't take the pressure and finally cracks.

Kids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the 
staircase splinters. Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed 
over the edge. It's a disaster. Broken boned teenagers litter the floor 
like it were a battlefield.

Kenny manages to grab hold of the second floor as kids fall past him.

The whole house begins to buckle.

INT.   BEDROOM

The room empties as the kids push out. Leonard pulls Jody up next to him 
and puts the razor to her neck. He draws the first spot of blood.

                      JODY
                Please! You wouldn't kill your
                sister, would you?

                     LEONARD
                You think you're my sister?

INT.   STAIRCASE

Kenny manages to pull himself back up to the second floor.

INT.   BEDROOM

Jody turns to look at LEONARD as Kenny appears in the doorway.

                      JODY
                 We have the same color eyes.

He looks into her eyes.

                      LEONARD
                 You're right. We do.

Leonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just 
the break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him 
over. They struggle for the razor but Leonard overpowers him and grabs it, 
cutting his own hand. He turns and slices Kenny down the side, cutting him 
deep.

Kenny fights off the pain and leaps on Leonard's back, grabbing his arm 
around the neck.

Leonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock Kenny off his back, 
smashing him into walls.

Kenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at Leonard's face and 
throat.

Leonard spins faster.

JODY struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood. 
Kenny's grips start to slip as Leonard reaches back, to slice him across 
the face and neck.

LEONARD, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo. He screams, 
loses his grip on Kenny, goes crashing out the second story window.

EXT.  HOUSE

Leonard crashes to the ground below, landing on his back on the front 
steps.

INT.  BEDROOM

Jody looks out after him. He looks up to her. Their eyes meet.

EXT.  HOUSE

KIDS start circling Leonard.

Leonard gets to his knees, still holding the razor. They start taunting 
him.

                    BOY 1
                It's the freak!

The kids inch closer to Leonard.
          
                    GIRL 1
                He's still got the blade!

One kid kicks him. Leonard slashes at the kid, but misses. Another boy 
kicks the knife out of his hands. A third picks it up.

                    BOY 3
                Come on! It's fuck him up time!

One boy kicks Leonard in the face. Another kicks him in the ribs, another 
in the balls. Leonard tries to fight back for a second but slowly they all 
descend on him, taking turns kicking and beating the ever living shit out 
of him. It's a feeding frenzy.  He disappears under the angry mob of 
teenagers.

INT.  BEDROOM

Jody helps Kenny to his feet.

                     KENNY
                Come on. Lets get out of here.

EXT.  FRONT YARD

Police cars screech to a stop out front. The kids are all disappearing off 
down the street.

JODY AND KENNY emerge out the front door, look down at LEONARD, barely 
alive, lying at bloody mess at the base of the steps.
     
                      LEONARD
                J-Jody. P-please help me.
                Please.

Leonard spits up blood. Jody squeals. Kenny covers her eyes.

CLOSE on the BALCONY overhead. The railing breaks off and the balcony 
comes crashing down, falling on Leonard, killing him. Jody embraces Kenny 
tightly.

                      KENNY
                It's all over now.

dissolve to:

EXT.  AVON LAKE CEMETERY

Cemetery- Brent's coffin is in a grave. People are leaving the funeral.

Jody is with her Mom. They are the last ones there. They watch as the 
workers start to throw dirt on the coffin.

Jody takes her mom's hand in her own. They're close again.

Dissolve to:

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM -  A MONTH LATER

It's night. Jody is asleep.

EXT.  BEDROOM

Someone is in the shadows outside, climbing up to her bedroom window.

INT.  BEDROOM

Intruder's POV - Through the window, Jody is sound asleep in her bed, 
vulnerable.

The window opens. Someone steps in and moves quietly over to the edge of 
the bed. She wakes, startled. She looks up. IT'S KENNY.

                     KENNY
                  (smiling)
               I'm all out of patience.

He climbs in her bed and takes her. She lets him. She's into it.

A pair of eyes peer through the slates of Jody's closet door. Someone is 
hidden in her closet.

KILLER'S POV - Jody and Kenny are now in the middle of making love for the 
first time. It's getting hot.

                     JODY
               Oh God, this is the way it
               should be.

The closet door opens. The real LISA SHERMAN is there. Maybe she wasn't 
dead after all!

She starts toward Jody, raising a huge butcher knife over her head.

Jody sees her and screams.

The knife comes down toward the center of Kenny's back.

His face contorts as the knife enters his body. Jody screams as he coughs 
up blood all over her breasts.

He looks helplessly at Jody, dying as the knife comes down again.

But now it's her father who's doing the stabbing!

INT.  JODY'S BEDROOM 

Jody wakes up from her dream, startled and shaken. She looks next to 
herself in bed. Kenny is lying there asleep, smiling, probably dreaming of 
her. The window is open. He must have climbed in.

There is a little red spot on the sheet next to her.

She cuddles up next to him as the sun starts to rise outside.

Dissolve to:

EXT.  CHERRY FALLS

The entrance to the town. The hanging sign reads 'Entering Cherry Falls, 
Ohio'.

The beautiful town is now peaceful again. The crickets are chirping, the 
robins begin cooing. Suddenly a window comes up and the hanging sign 
begins to sway back and forth, almost on its own.

   CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG

   A nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems
   to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind.


   INT. CAFE-DAY

   LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a
   friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost
   villainous in how collective he is.

   He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the
   cause for his anxious state.

                        LOUIS
                 (smug)
          Something is bothering you...

   We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is
   obviously uneasy about being out in public with this
   person.

                       QUINN
          I appreciate the faux concern but I'm
          fine.

   Louis is taken aback.

                       LOUIS
          My concern is genuine...

                       QUINN
          With our history can you honestly say you
          care about my well being?

                       LOUIS
          Yes I can, our connection is a product of
          destiny. I have no ill-will against you.

   Quinn scoffs.

                         QUINN
          1941-

                       LOUIS
          -The Stephen Speilberg film?

                       QUINN
          No, there was that little French girl I
          liked. You..you violated her and torched
          her farm killing her family-
                                                      2.


                       LOUIS
          -Actually you are jacking up the story, I
          violated her father in front of
          her...then I torched the farm.

                       QUINN
          Well...that makes it ten times better.

                       LOUIS
          Quinn that was war, people do crazy
          things midst of wide spread conflict. I
          have gotten jaded over time. It's not
          like the dark ages when I had style.

                       QUINN
          When you would rape the horses and ride
          away on the women?

                       LOUIS
          Yeah I was such a ham.
          (beat)
          Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten
          carried away in the past, but now I'm
          tired. I just want to get this over with.
          It's our calling, we help bring order and
          balance to the universe.
           (beat)
          Maybe I would feel less removed if you
          would let me win just once.

                       QUINN
          This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I
          take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of
          some bookie...I'm bringing on the
          apocalypse.
Louis takes a drink of his coffee.

                       LOUIS
          See at least our obligation would be
          over.

                       QUINN
          Louis I might be nervous, but I accept my
          role as savior of this world.
          (beat)
          We have been doing this for years-

                        LOUIS
          -centuries-

                       QUINN
          -and in 5 days we will do the same thing
          we have always done.
                       (MORE)
                                                       3.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          (beat)
          We'll fight to the death.

                       LOUIS
          Atta' boy!

TITLECARD: CHRIST COMPLEX


INT. CAFE-DAY-MOMENTS LATER

We pan across the cafe to the table of ZOEY and RICK, a
young college aged couple. Zoey is obviously trying to
have a serious conversation, while Rick hides behind his
laptop using it as a shield.

                       ZOEY
          ...I'm not saying this is an
          intervention.

Rick doesn't look up from his laptop screen.

                       RICK
          Wouldn't there be more people here if it
          was an intervention?

                       ZOEY
          See and I don't want it to be-

                       RICK
          (disinterested)
          -That's because it's not

                       ZOEY
          It's just...I mean...are you gambling
          again?
                       RICK
          (totally removed)
           Nope.

                       ZOEY
          Because...um...the laptop, and you never
          go anywhere with out it-

                       RICK
          -it's my lifeline-

                       ZOEY
          -Yeah well...I just know when I met you I
          saved you from that downhill spiral...you
          know...uh...the online poker-
                                                      4.


                       RICK
          -I'm not a project, you know that right?

                       ZOEY
          Of course not...I never said you were.

                       RICK
          Because you act like it...I wonder if I
          didn't have this "so called problem" if
          you would have even been interested in
          me.

                       ZOEY
          Of course I would. I just-

                       RICK
          -Take it upon yourself to save people.

                       ZOEY
          OK...maybe. Honestly we have to save each
          other, who else is going to do it.

                       RICK
          (continued to be removed)
          People could just save themselves.

                       ZOEY
          True. Is that human nature? People rely
          on false deities, self help books...Rick
          the day I realized we were alone in the
          universe was the day I realized we have
          to be there for each other.
          (beat)
          Plus don't you find it romantic that I
          want to save you? Like a movie...

                       RICK
          So our relationship is like a romantic
          comedy?

                       ZOEY
          (dreamy)
          A Cameron Crowe romantic comedy.

                       RICK
          Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm
          doing on the computer?

Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall".

                       ZOEY
          Yes...of course!
                                                      5.


Rick spins the computer around.

                       RICK
          Check that out Lloyd Dobler.

                       ZOEY
          (Shocked)
           Is that...porn?

                       RICK
          Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn.

                       ZOEY
          Um....
          (lightbulb)
           wait...is that?

                       RICK
          Oh yes...

                       ZOEY
          Us having sex?

                       RICK
          Oh yeah...

Rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen.

                       RICK (CONT'D)
          I love the part coming up.
           (beat)
          You know where I put your legs behind
          your head and yell "hump bunny!"

                       ZOEY
          Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this...
                       RICK
          Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with
          you.

                       ZOEY
          What?-

                       RICK
          -Yeah not working any more for me-

                       ZOEY
          What the hell?!? How is it not working?!?

                       RICK
          You are yelling...you know I don't like
          confrontational situations.
                                                          6.


                       ZOEY
          I'm not trying to be confrontational...I
          just...you are breaking up with me?

                       RICK
          -Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now?

Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward
Rick.

                       RICK (CONT'D)
          (looking at the screen)
           This part is fucking priceless.

Zoey is bewildered.


EXT. PARK-AFTERNOON

Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching
for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree
limb.

He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right
hand.

                       LOUIS
          This will do.

He throws it over to Quinn, who catches it in one swift
move.

                       QUINN
          So what are you wanting to do?

Louis searches around for a stick of his own.
                       LOUIS
          I figure we would train...

                       QUINN
          Why?

Louis finds what he is looking for as he spins his limb
into attack position.

                       LOUIS
          Because you dominate me every time-
          (beat)
          -ohh that sounded dirty

                       QUINN
          So you want me to help you get an
          advantage?
                                                       7.


                       LOUIS
          No, I want you to help me put on a good
          show. Everyone loves a good climax Quinn.


PARK-RIVERSIDE-CONTINUOUS

Zoey sits on a bench beside her best friend ANNA. Zoey is
completely distant, as Anna's words pass through her into
thin air.

                       ANNA
          You know I don't like interjecting myself
          into other people's affairs but-

                       ZOEY
          (barley paying attention)
          -But you're going to

                       ANNA
          You let Rick do this to you.

                       ZOEY
          (Snapping to it)
           How so?

                       ANNA
          You think you can change the men you are
          with. You can't get into a relationship
          with someone in the hopes that you can
          mold them into the person you want them
          to be.

                       ZOEY
          Rick needed someone stable-
                       ANNA
          -Rick needs castrated.

                       ZOEY
          That's slightly strong.

                       ANNA
          He was an asshole.

                       ZOEY
          Misunderstood-

                       ANNA
          -OK I'll meet you half
          way...misunderstood asshole.
           (beat)
          You have been repeating the same cycle
          your whole entire life.
                                                          8.


                         ZOEY
            Now that's a little off base.

FLASHBACK

ZOEY 10 YEARS OLD

A young BOY is sitting on another little boy's head. It
looks like he is passing gas on him.

                         ANNA (V.O.)
            Remember Billy, who used to give kids the
            "dirty bomb"? You took it upon yourself
            to change this behavior-

The boy is now doing the same to Zoey.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            -This put you right in the cross-hairs to
            be his next victim.

ZOEY 13 YEARS OLD

ZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street
corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well
as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if
South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug
            dealer-
Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            -You took it upon yourself to be his
            personal savoir. What did it get you?

Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS
show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to
show he doesn't have any dough on him.

                         ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Well when Zach's old business partners
            wanted to collect on a debt-

Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them.
                                                          9.


A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee
table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine.

                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          - they used you to replace their missing
          coffee table they broke during a drunken
          party.

ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD.

A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles
showing his golden grille.

                       ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          -And then you have Toothpick. What kind
          of name is Toothpick?

                       ZOEY (V.O.)
          It was his gang name.

                       ANNA (V.O.)
          Of course.

It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He
takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          We won't talk about prom night. Needless
          to say it wasn't romantic.

Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is
standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It
appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with
the black censor bar.

PARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAY

                       ZOEY
          Exaggerations-

                       ANNA
          -Accurate account of events... The story
          of your romantic life-

                       ZOEY
          -Unfair. Because these people need
          someone who is going to sacrifice their
          own needs for them.
                                                      10.


                       ANNA
          Why?

                       ZOEY
          Who else is going to do it? We're alone
          in the universe. If we are going to make
          it through this "crazy world" we need to
          look out for each other.

                       ANNA
          I think you use atheism and the whole "we
          are alone in the universe" jive to
          justify your actions.
          (beat)
          I regret taking you to see Dawkins
          because you use that as a fall back to be
          codependent.

                       ZOEY
          First of all you are bitter about the
          whole Dawkins thing, because you flashed
          him your tits and got us kicked out-

                       ANNA
          -You didn't even know the first thing
          about "The God Delusion" until I gave you
          a copy-

                       ZOEY
          -And someone who was huge supporter turns
          her back because Richard Dawkins didn't
          like her nipple piercing-

                       ANNA
          (playful banter)
          -Enjoy your suite in hell non-believer-
                       ZOEY
          (more banter)
          -Enjoy your delusional life there fence
          sitter. How about you pray to Thor to hit
          me with a lighting bolt so I can be
          removed from this asinine conversation.

                       ANNA
          You're hiding behind this religious
          debate because you don't want to admit
          you have always gravitated toward the
          "wrong type" of guy.

Zoey is staring off into space.
                                                        11.


                       ZOEY
          (detached)
          I actually stopped listening to you.

                       ANNA
          What are you staring at?

Zoey points at Quinn and Louis, who are fighting with
tree limbs in the distance.

                       ZOEY
          Who are those guys?

                       ANNA
          The one closest to us is Quinn. Very
          weird, socially awkward type of guy. I
          don't know who his friend is.

                       ZOEY
          What are they doing?

                       ANNA
          I don't know. Looks like that stuff my ex-
          Rob was into-

                       ZOEY
          Oh that medieval rugby style game-

                       ANNA
          -Yeah the made up sport from "Blood Of
          Heroes"...Oh...Jugger!-

                       ZOEY
          -Sounds pornographic.
           (beat)
          So Quinn? What else do you know about
          him?

                       ANNA
          Oh no you don't! This is exactly what I
          was talking about!

Anna senses something in Zoey that she is trying to hide.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          Wait a second? You've already established
          contact with Quinn?

                       ZOEY
          What is this MI-6?

                       ANNA
          You have your sights on him already!
                                                         12.


                       ZOEY
          No, I'm just curious.

                       ANNA
          What happened?

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

TITLE CARD: 2 HOURS AGO


PARK-RIVERSIDE-EARLIER

Zoey is overcome with emotion as she makes her way down
to the riverside. She is holding something tight in her
hand.

CLOSE UP-HAND

As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm.
It appears this might have belonged to Rick.


PARK-RIVERSIDE

Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the
river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it
slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench.

Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the
first time.

                       ZOEY
          (making her way to the bench)
          I'm so sorry
Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up
the ring.

                       QUINN
          (handing the ring back to her)
          Is this yours?

She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket.

                       ZOEY
          Kinda... Again I'm so sorry.

                       QUINN
          No need to apologize.

Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit.
                                                      13.


                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          Do you want to sit?

                         ZOEY
          (unsure)
           OK?

Zoey sits, still apprehensive.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          (reaching her hand out)
           I'm Zoey.

                       QUINN
          (He returns the gesture)
           Quinn.
          (beat)
          Zoey? Interesting.

                       ZOEY
          Oh name? Yes, most people have
          interesting stories behind their
          names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure
          why my parents did that.

                         QUINN
          Very unique.

                       ZOEY
          (smiles)
          I suppose that's a compliment. So I've
          seen you around school, but never
          really...in...class...

                       QUINN
          I don't go to Marshall, I live near the
          campus though.

                       ZOEY
          Oh, well so what do you do?

                       QUINN
          As in profession? I don't really have
          one.

                       ZOEY
          Really? Rent is insane around here...

                       QUINN
          Yeah, my father provides for me.

                       ZOEY
          That's pretty cool. What's he into?
                                           14.


              QUINN
Everything.

             ZOEY
An entrepreneur...That's awesome.
(beat)
Well...So do you like coming down here?

             QUINN
To the river?

             ZOEY
(smiles)
Yes where we are right now.

             QUINN
I just needed to think.

             ZOEY
Yeah me too. I just suffered a break up.

             QUINN
My apologies.

             ZOEY
No it's OK. I mean I'm over it.

             QUINN
(laughs)
My head disagrees.

              ZOEY
I'm sorry.

             QUINN
It's really OK.
             ZOEY
So what did you need to think about? I
mean if I'm not prying of course.

             QUINN
No, I just have some problems.
(beat)
I'm not sure about my calling in life.

             ZOEY
I'm not sure anyone is. You know if you
need a friend, I'd be glad to...well you
know...listen.

             QUINN
I'd appreciate that. I don't have many
friends.
                                                         15.


                       ZOEY
          I know.
          (trying to double back)
          I mean...I've seen you around
          campus...you seem like a loner...I didn't
          mean you were a loser. Loner is kind of
          sexy, loser...well can kind of be
          too...I'll stop.

                       QUINN
          No, it's OK. I agree it never hurts to
          have a friend.

                       ZOEY
          So we can maybe go out to dinner if you
          want?

                       QUINN
          OK...

                       ZOEY
          And I can pay, you know..make up for the
          head...

                       QUINN
          You really don't have to.

                       ZOEY
          No I want to.

                       QUINN
          OK.

                       ZOEY
          Well...
          (beat)
          Good let's meet up tonight. My place,
          7pm.

TITLE CARD: 7PM


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-7PM

JACK, A 20 year old gay man who loves him a good "Cosby
Sweater", is sitting at the computer desk "surfing" on
the desktop.

Anna walks up from behind and runs her fingers through
Jack's hair.
                                                         16.


                       JACK
          So when does Ted Bundy get here?

We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself
down on the couch.

                       ANNA
          I promised her we would behave.

A KNOCK is heard at the front door.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          Although knocking right as I sat down
          doesn't endear him to me...

Jack gets up from the desk.

                       JACK
          You sit your pretty little ass down
          hooker.


Anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch.

                       ANNA
          This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You
          are way to good to me.

Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn.

                       JACK
          Look at this mother fucker.

He rudely motions him to come in and sit down.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for
          a night of manipulation, sit the fuck
          down.

                       QUINN
          (confused)
          Um...OK?

In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn, is he being rude?

                       QUINN
          (looking at Jack)
          No quite pleasant.

Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch.
                                                        17.


                        ZOEY
          Let's go.

                       JACK
          (looking at Quinn)
          I will call the state police in a fucking
          heart beat if she isn't here by midnight.

                       QUINN
          (still confused)
          OK?

Anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation.

                       ZOEY
          Anna, you going to call the guard dog
          off?

                       ANNA
          (out of it)
          David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight.
          I'm relaxing and not getting in the
          middle.

                       QUINN
          (To Jack and Anna)
          Nice meeting both of you.

                       JACK
          Get the fuck out.

                       ZOEY
          (to Jack and Anna)
          Don't wait up

Zoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares
daggers.


EXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Zoey shuts the door and then turns to stop Quinn.

                       ZOEY
          Sorry about Jack...

                        QUINN
          I like him.
                                                      18.


INT. RESTAURANT-MOMENTS LATER

Zoey and Quinn are enjoying their meal at this fancy
upscale establishment. Quinn picks up his menu, running
his finger down though the menu items.

                       QUINN
          Zoey I would be more than happy to pay.

                       ZOEY
          No not at all. This is on me.

                       QUINN
          I can cover dessert at least.

                       ZOEY
          Listen Quinn, I'm an atheist-

                       QUINN
          -So you don't want dessert?-

                       ZOEY
          -No, I just wanted to get it out of the
          way. It bothers people, I mean in this
          state especially.

Quinn puts down the menu.

                       QUINN
          It doesn't bother me.

                        ZOEY
          Really?

                       QUINN
          I don't believe anyone is truly an
          atheist at the end.

                       ZOEY
          I'm pretty sure I'm really an atheist.

                        QUINN
          Why's that?

                       ZOEY
          Because I'm a logical thinker.
          (beat)
          I don't mean to offend, I'm guessing
          you're religious.

                       QUINN
          One supports the business they are in I
          guess.
                                           19.


             ZOEY
Oh my God you are in the ministry.

              QUINN
(smiles)
Kind of.

             ZOEY
My father was a "fire and damnation"
preacher. Baptist...He's...

              QUINN
He's?

             ZOEY
It's nothing.
(beat)
Sorry I don't mean to rock your world.

              QUINN
(smiles)
You didn't.

             ZOEY
You poor thing. You are probably so
desperate for friends-

              QUINN
(laughs)
What?

             ZOEY
Have you thought about St John's Wort?

             QUINN
You are a very cryptic speaker.
             ZOEY
No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was
just...well...you have some social
awkwardness.

              QUINN
OK?

             ZOEY
Well you are latching on to religion to
make you feel whole. It doesn't make you
feel whole, or at least as whole as you
thought it would-

             QUINN
You are kind of right on that one.
                                                       20.


                        ZOEY
           So you are out with me...I represent
           everything you were brought up to combat.
           You're missing something and you are
           looking for help.

                        QUINN
           I am looking for help. I'm out with you
           though because I'm interested in getting
           to know you.

                        ZOEY
           (smiles)
           See I'm good at reading people.

                        QUINN
           (rolls eyes, smiles)
            Kind of.

                        ZOEY
           I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost
           soul. I thought that when I saw you by
           the river.

                        QUINN
           You like lost souls don't you?

                        ZOEY
           Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save
           them.

                        QUINN
           You going to save me?

                        ZOEY
           If you let me.
                        QUINN
           I think you might be able to.

                        ZOEY
           (endearing smile)
           So what do you need Quinn?

                        QUINN
           (smiles)
           Dessert.


INT.   ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER

Jack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey
are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl
talk".
                                                         21.


                       ANNA
          I don't know, he seems fishy.

                       ZOEY
          He seems harmless.

                       ANNA
          I have heard that a million times.

                       ZOEY
          I know. He's in the ministry-

                       ANNA
          -and you hate organized religion.

                       ZOEY
          I know and he's understanding of that.

                       ANNA
          Plus it's to my understanding he didn't
          actually admit what he did. He just did a
          bunch of double talk.

                       ZOEY
          It was understood.

                       ANNA
          Yeah again...not feeling confident in
          your choices. Please Zoey...
          (beat)...
          Be careful this time.

TITLE CARD: 4 DAYS LEFT


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-DAY
Quinn is sleeping in his bed. His room is rather bare,
with the exception of the basic living necessities. It
almost appears like a room at the "Y".

CLOSE UP-EDGE OF BED

A foot is seen kicking the bed, startling Quinn.


QUINN'S ROOM

Quinn flies out of bed and sees Louis leaning against the
wall with his arms crossed.

                       LOUIS
          Where were you last night?
                                                         22.


                       QUINN
          (getting his bearings)
          Out...thinking.

                       LOUIS
          You've done a lot of mopping and thinking
          over the centuries. It kind of brings me
          down.

                       QUINN
          So what do you need?

                          LOUIS
          Training.


EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Louis and Quinn walk out into a huge open field. Louis is
carrying a black tote bag that he drops on the ground.

                       LOUIS
          Now this is a place for a climatic
          battle.

                          QUINN
          Not bad.

Quinn points at the bag

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          What's in the bag?

                       LOUIS
          You will love this.
Louis goes to the tote bag and starts to unzip it.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I went to the toy store last night and
          picked these up.

He reaches into the bag and pulls out two "nurf" style
swords out.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Nothing like our real stuff, but it will
          do.

Louis throws one of the "swords" to Quinn.

                       QUINN
          (catching it)
          It's kind of lightweight..and silly.
                                                         23.


Louis comes over carrying his sword.

                       LOUIS
          Come on give it a chance.

Louis comes at Quinn and his instinct kicks in. The two
begin their mock battle.


TREE

From behind a tree we see RYAN BLOOD for the first time.
He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital
camera.

Quinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the
unwanted attention.


INT. CAFE-DAY

Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the
front window. It almost as if he is searching for
something.

                       LOUIS
          You have not been lively at all this go
          around.

                       QUINN
          A lot on my mind...

                       LOUIS
          We only do this once every seventy years
          brother. You have to enjoy it while it
          lasts.
                       QUINN
          Louis our whole purpose here, is to show
          up, and over time establish a social
          base, and then kill each other.

                       LOUIS
          You know and I'm very good at the social
          base part, and you are not so good...

                       QUINN
          That's because you find a way to screw it
          up every time.

                       LOUIS
          That's because, I know this is news to
          you, I represent evil.
                       (MORE)
                                                        24.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn.
          I really want to stop being the
          ambassador for this.

                       QUINN
          That's something we agree on. I'm tired
          too.

                       LOUIS
          I don't know if we can get off this
          train. It's just a viscous cycle.

                       QUINN
          Letting you win is not an option.

                       LOUIS
          I wasn't going there...
          (beat)
          ...yet.


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EVENING

Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their
way for the door.

                       ZOEY (O.S.)
          You guys leaving?

Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn.

                       JACK
          Yeah we don't want to interrupt your
          "date rape".

Anna hits Jack.
                       ANNA
          Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here
          anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my
          friend...We knew he was here.

Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn.

                       ZOEY
          Will you guys stop??

                       QUINN
          It's OK. I like your friends.

Anna walks over to the couch.

                       ANNA
          So Quinn?
                                                        25.


                        QUINN
          Yes?

                       ANNA
          Zoey says you are in the ministry?

                        QUINN
          Sort of.

                       ANNA
          You are or you aren't.

                       QUINN
          It's complicated.

                       ANNA
          At some point you will have to explain it
          to Zoey. I mean don't you agree?

                        QUINN
          Well...

                       ZOEY
          (put out)
           Will you guys leave??

Jack grabs Anna by the arm and leads her to the door.

                       JACK
          Who is going too far now?

                        ANNA
          "Date Rape"

                       ZOEY
          (trying to make a point)
          Bye guys!

Anna and Jack mumble as they head out the door.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          (turning to Quinn)
          Sorry about that.

                       QUINN
          It's really OK.


EXT. APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Jack puts his arm around Anna, as to stop her for a
second.
                                                         26.


                       JACK
          You know I hate him because it's my
          nature but-

                       ANNA
          -You think I hate him because of my
          distrust of men?

                       JACK
          Tragedy changes people, it effected Zoey
          in one way...you in another.

                       ANNA
          Yeah
          (beat,smiles)
          I became a "fag hag"

                                                    BACK TO:


INT.ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Zoey is curled up next to Quinn on the couch. A popcorn
bowl is squeezed in between them. She reaches over and
picks up the remote.

                       ZOEY
          Tonight's Feature Presentation is "I am
          Curious:Yellow". Probably not the best
          date movie, but I always show this to
          ever guy in the beginning.

                       QUINN
          It's OK this will be my first film
          experience.
                        ZOEY
          What??

                       QUINN
          Yeah, I've never seen a film before. I
          mean I know of films, can't live in this
          world and not. I've just never seen one.

                       ZOEY
          This might be a little hard-core for your
          first film.

                       QUINN
          No it's OK. I'm excited.

Zoey shakes her head.
                                                        27.


                       ZOEY
          I feel like I'm stealing your virginity
          here.

Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          You're a virgin too aren't you?

Quinn shrugs

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          Oh my god! I'm a bad girl.

Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder.

                          QUINN
          (smiles)
          You are not.

Quinn motions to the TV.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          Please play the film.

                       ZOEY
          (hesitant)
          OK? I mean I usually play this for
          potential boyfriends. If they can handle
          this, they can handle me.

Zoey hits play on the remote.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          I guess you're lucky I thought about
          "They Call Her One Eye".
          (to herself)
          I hope this doesn't jack you up.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 3 DAYS LEFT


EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field.
He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance.

                       QUINN
          (monotone)
          I am curious Yellow...

Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap.
                                                      28.


                       LOUIS
          What the hell are you talking about?

Quinn stands up and grabs the sword.

                       QUINN
          Nothing really.

The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his
heart in it.

                       LOUIS
          You half asleep Quinn?

Quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his
side. Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his
sword.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Look at that ladies and gentleman the
          apocalypse has begun.

Quinn sits down.

                       QUINN
          Have you ever seen a movie?

Louis follows his lead.

                       LOUIS
          I've seen plenty of movies.

                          QUINN
          Really?

                       LOUIS
          Yeah I watched "The Sorrow and The Pity"
          at Marshal the other day. You know people
          here have yet to figure out we are not
          students.

                       QUINN
          I think they have a pretty good idea.

                       LOUIS
          So in all the times we have been here,
          you haven't gone to the cinema?

                          QUINN
          No...

                          LOUIS
          Why not?
                                                         29.


                       QUINN
          It's not what we are here to do.

                       LOUIS
          In your bosses name, what is wrong with
          you? You've got to enjoy yourself. You
          might be chosen, but you have needs. We
          all do.

                       QUINN
          I have to stay focused.

                       LOUIS
          You've also burned yourself out. You're
          not going to be any good to me...

Louis gets up and reaches out to help Quinn

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          ...unless you take some "you" time.

Quinn takes Louis' hand and gets to his feet.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Can we get back to the matter at hand?

Louis brings his sword back up into attack position.
Quinn is back to his "swashbuckling" self. The two battle
it out on the field, matching each other blow for blow.


INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

We creep upon Ryan Blood as he works at his computer. On
closer inspection, it appears he is editing video of
Quinn and Louis' mock fight earlier in the day.

INT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Louis' set up is more lavish than Quinn's. It's obvious
he indulges just a little too much.

Louis comes out of the bathroom with a towel around his
waist. He starts singing "Motown" songs to himself.

He walks back off screen to the bedroom. We still hear
him singing, as we pan around the apartment.

We swing back around to the entrance of Louis' bedroom.
He finally comes out fully dressed. He uses the towel he
was wearing to finish drying his hair.

He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself.
                                                         30.


LOUIS' POV

He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to
straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel
and squirts a small amount in his hand.

He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look.

                          LOUIS
             (to himself)
             You are a handsome devil.


LOUIS APARTMENT

Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee
table. He then dances right out the door.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there.

                          LOUIS
             (puzzled)
             Weird?

Louis walks out into...


HALLWAY

...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of
his room, across the hall.

                          RYAN BLOOD
             You looking for Quinn?

Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question.

                          LOUIS
             Yes?

                          RYAN BLOOD
             (nodding toward the exit door)
             He just left.


EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING

Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In
the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey
holding hands.
                                                      31.


                       LOUIS
          (to himself)
          What do we have here?


EXT. CAFE-MOMENTS LATER

Louis stands across the street, staring right into the
window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a
date.

His eyes widen as their hands touch.


EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-LATER

Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment
building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns
to face Quinn.

                       ZOEY
          Why haven't I seen your place?

                       QUINN
          My place isn't very exciting.

                       ZOEY
          That doesn't surprise me. I can't imagine
          you having a vast Blu Ray collection.

                          QUINN
          Blu Ray?

                       ZOEY
          Wow...Quinn, you have to start enjoying
          the world around you.
                       QUINN
          You know I realized today you are right
          about that.

                       ZOEY
          So you're saying you want to come up
          stairs and watch "They Call Her One Eye"?

                       QUINN
          (laughs)
          Uh...no. I'm still trying to get I am
          Curious Yellow out of my head.

                       ZOEY
          Yeah...sorry about that...
                                                         32.


                         QUINN
          (smiles)
          It's OK.

Suddenly, guided by instinct, Zoey kisses Quinn on the
lips. Quinn is completely thrown.

                       ZOEY
          I...I..I'm sorry.

                         QUINN
          No don't be.

                       ZOEY
          I shouldn't have been that aggressive.

                       QUINN
          No...it's OK.

                         ZOEY
          OK?

                       QUINN
          I need to get back though.

                       ZOEY
          Puzzling...but I know...virgin and all-

                       QUINN
          -Well...I mean...

                       ZOEY
          That came out rude...I just mean...I
          wanted to do it. I should have taken it
          slower.
                       QUINN
          It's OK. I'll be by tomorrow.

                         ZOEY
          You sure?

                       QUINN
          Yes of course.

                         ZOEY
          (worried)
          I hope so.

Quinn slowly turns around and walks away. Zoey looks at
him like she is unsure if she will see him again.
                                                         33.


DUMPSTER

Meanwhile, leaning against the dumpster, Louis watches
the display unseen.


INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

Ryan is working at his PC when a KNOCK is heard. He gets
up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the
door.

As he swings it open we see Louis on the other side.


RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Ryan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off
a spot on a messy couch.

The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole"

                        RYAN BLOOD
           You're here to learn more about his
           "coming and goings". To find out what I
           have seen.

                        LOUIS
           So far you are dead on.

                        RYAN BLOOD
           It's more than that Louis-

                        LOUIS
           -You know who I am?
                        RYAN BLOOD
           I know pretty much everything. I've
           watched you, studied you...I feel I'm
           expert on your little game every seventy
           years.

                       LOUIS
           Really?

                       RYAN BLOOD
           Oh yes.

Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers
one at a time at Louis.

                        RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
           You battled as mortals-
           (beat)
                        (MORE)
                                                       34.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          -You were a Lamanite then-
          (beat)
          -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites,
          last survivor of that nation-
           (beat)
          -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his
          future...his destiny-
          (beat)
          -See after the death of Christ there was
          some debate on what was going to bring on
          the end and signal his return-
          (beat)
          - It was decided two great warriors had
          to fight. The winner would determine the
          start of the apocalypse. Your boss of
          course needed someone to represent his
          interests. Who better than Quinn's old
          adversary?

Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.

                       LOUIS
          Where are you going with this you weird
          little man?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          You had strategy in the beginning. Middle
          Ages...Old West...Even World War II.
          (beat)
          Let's take a step back for a second. The
          Old West. Lack of faith, corruption,
          these things make Quinn weak. The chink
          in his armor is his faith in people. You
          knew that, and corrupting America...a
          young land...was the key.
          (beat)
          Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked
          for a human ally. That ally was Joseph
          Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led
          Joseph to the plates that later when into-

Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks
down at the "Book Of Mormon".

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          -His little plan didn't work, but the
          book is a great coffee table discussion
          piece. This made him weak Louis. You
          could have destroyed him. The problem is
          you've allowed yourself to become fond of
          him. YOU need to embrace your destiny.

                       LOUIS
          How do I do that?
                                                      35.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          This girl is distracting him. Get his
          mind focused on the matter at hand. At
          this point I'm afraid he isn't even going
          to fight you.

                       LOUIS
          I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn.
          He comes across creepy.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Maybe that's the key-

                       LOUIS
          (lightbulb)
          -Make her think he's crazy.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette
in the far corner.

                       LOUIS
          Where have you been?

The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view.
It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from
the darkness.

                       QUINN
          You've been waiting long?

                       LOUIS
          No I figured you were on your way back-
                       QUINN
          -because you are spying on me again? So I
          don't need to tell you where I've been.

Louis sits down on the edge of the bed.

                       LOUIS
          Who's the girl?

                       QUINN
          It's started again. You're already
          jealous. You are going to do the same
          thing you did during the war...you're
          going to sabotage this.

                       LOUIS
          I'm insulted frankly.
                                                      36.


                       QUINN
          Don't you play that game. You are being
          facetious.

                       LOUIS
          No, I'm being serious. You care about the
          girl, it's obvious. Not in a friendship
          or I'm curious about human behavior way.

Quinn sits down beside him.

                       QUINN
          So why are you here?

                       LOUIS
          Have you told her?

                       QUINN
          Who I am? Of course not!

                       LOUIS
          Quinn you only have a few days left and
          you care for this girl-
           (beat)
          - What's the harm in telling her?

                       QUINN
          There's a lot of harm in telling her.

                       LOUIS
          If this is real and you really care for
          this girl, you have to tell her. It's
          only fair to her.

                       QUINN
          She has a best friend who is very guarded
          of me...It's odd she eluded to the same
          thing. You know the whole "I'm hiding
          something, and I need to come out into
          the open" thing.

                       LOUIS
          Sounds to me like she is right.

Quinn gets up and walks to the door.

                       QUINN
          Well I better do this now then.

                       LOUIS
          Yeah you don't want to lose your nerve.

                       QUINN
          Can you let yourself out?
                                                      37.


                       LOUIS
          Of course.

Quinn slowly opens the door and walks out. The door
creeps shut behind him.

Louis smiles to himself, feeling satisfaction. His face
looks evil, almost demonic.


EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING- SOMETIME LATER

In almost a "romantic movie" way, Quinn runs toward
Zoey's apartment. When he reaches the door he knocks like
his life depends on it.

Anna swings the door open, she's obviously surprised to
see Quinn.

                       ANNA
          What the hell?

You can hear Jack inside the apartment.

                       JACK (O.S.)
          What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me
          the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace!

                       QUINN
          I need to see Zoey.

                       ANNA
          What about tomorrow? Or never is good.

You hear Zoey off screen.
                       ZOEY (O.S.)
          What's going on??

Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          Quinn? What's wrong?

                       QUINN
          I need to talk to you, it's important.

Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing
her right past Anna.

                       ANNA
          Jesus Christ!

Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside.
                                                      38.


                       QUINN
          I need to tell you everything. Anna is so
          right.

                       ZOEY
          What are you talking about? Anna is
          right?

                       QUINN
          I've not been honest with you about what
          I do...or who I am.

                         ZOEY
          OK?

                       QUINN
          I need to come clean. I want you to trust
          me. I want your friends to trust me.

                       ZOEY
          (nervous laugh)
          OK Quinn, just spit it out.

                       QUINN
          OK
          (beat)
          I'm an archangel named Moroni and I
          basically represent "light" or everything
          that's good. Louis, my friend, represents
          "darkness". Every seventy years we have
          to fight to the death. If I win
          everything stays the way it is. The world
          continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes
          on the role of the Antichrist and the
          apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking
          Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only
          have a limited time left in this world...
          (beat)
          I want to spend that time with you.

Zoey is stunned, silent.

                         ZOEY
          Oh honey...

Zoey touches his face.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          You must have a brain tumor or something.
          You're obviously mentally ill.

                         QUINN
          Zoey? I...
                                                        39.


Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him.

                        ZOEY
           Shhh. You need me more than ever.

Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She
leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes
Quinn inside of the apartment.

The last image we see is the apartment door slamming
behind them.

                                                    CUT TO:

DARKNESS


FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-YEARS EARLIER-DAY

Zoey, roughly 2 years old, sits in the floor of her
parent's home playing.

Her DAD, only seen from the waist down, walks in front of
Zoey with his bible in hand. He makes it to Zoey's MOM,
on the other side of the room

                        DAD
           You're not even helping me!

                        MOM
           I don't even know what you want!

                        DAD
           I can't run my congregation with this
           sickness!
                        MOM
           The sickness is in your head.

                        DAD
           You're too busy running around doing
           whatever you feel like. I'm going to fall
           apart and it's all on you.


FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S HOME-TEN YEARS LATER-DAY

Zoey, now 12, is going through some boxes in the closet.
Her head bumps a shelf and a box falls on her.

When she goes to pick up the box she finds a ton of VHS
tapes.
                                                        40.


She goes through the box looking at the labels: "Anna age
7" "Anna age 10" "Anna age 12".


FLASHBACK-ZOEY'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The glow of Zoey's TV fills her face. We can neither see
nor hear what she is watching.

Zoey looks like she is about to throw up.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:


INT. ZOEY'S BEDROOM-PRESENT DAY-MORNING

Zoey jumps out of bed, like she is waking from a
nightmare. A startled Quinn, who was sleeping beside her,
starts to arouse.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 2 DAYS LEFT


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Louis walks into Quinn's room with his black tote bag
from earlier. It's obvious he was meeting Quinn to go
train.

He looks through out the room, but quickly realizes Quinn
is probably with Zoey. He slumps down on Quinn's bed.
Anger and hurt is portrayed upon his face.

INT.CAFE-LATER

Quinn and Zoey are having coffee. It's obvious Zoey had a
rough night. She takes a sip of coffee, her mind is
distant.

                          QUINN
          Last night?

                          ZOEY
          Yes?

                          QUINN
          Did you?

                       ZOEY
          Enjoy myself? Of course.
                                                      41.


                       QUINN
          Based on how you are acting this morning
          I have my doubts. That's not what I meant
          though. You woke up screaming.

                       ZOEY
          It was nothing.

                       QUINN
          I understand if you don't want to talk
          about it. I'm just concerned.

                       ZOEY
          It's not a big deal. It was...a...well
          wouldn't call it a nightmare...repressed
          memory. Hell, it's not repressed...I
          think of it all the time.

                          QUINN
          What is it?

                       ZOEY
          You don't want to hear about it.

Quinn touches her hand.

                          QUINN
          Please?

Zoey takes a deep breath.

                       ZOEY
          My father, I mentioned him before, was a
          Baptist minister. He always said he had
          this "sickness". He begged my mom for
          help, it was more important though for
          her to having shopping and dinner dates
          with her girlfriends. Anna, my friend
          that "loves you", has been in my life
          since I was tiny. She used to come over
          all the time. My Dad adored her. When I
          was around twelve I found something in
          the closet...tapes. My Dad and Anna from
          the time she was like seven...He...
          (starts tearing up)
          I showed my Mom, and Dad...well he got
          out of prison when I was seventeen. I
          don't see him anymore. His church, even
          though they knew he had a problem
          disowned him. He wouldn't have done that
          to Anna if my mom would have supported
          him, got him help.
                                                         42.


                       QUINN
          Who do you think is to blame?

                       ZOEY
          He tried to get help Quinn, he reached
          out to my Mom. I should have protected
          Anna too...I mean-

                       QUINN
          -None of this was your fault.

                       ZOEY
          I have to protect people. This was out of
          my control, you Quinn...What's going on
          with you...I have control of that.

Quinn looks at Zoey. He loves her, but a part of him
pities her too.


EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER

Zoey is curled up under Quinn's arm as they sit on the
same bench from earlier. Quinn stares out toward the
river. It's obvious he is pondering over his choices.

                       QUINN
          I love being with you.

                       ZOEY
          Me too.

                       QUINN
          I can't renege on my responsibilities
          with Louis though.
Zoey sits up.

                       ZOEY
          You're not actually going to fight your
          friend to the death are you?

                       QUINN
          I know you don't understand this. We just
          need to make the most of our time.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn, in 2 days things are going to be
          normal. This is just a delusion.

                       QUINN
          I know you don't understand. I just need
          to go see Louis today.
                                                         43.


                       ZOEY
          I understand that.

Quinn leans his head back. He catches something out of
the corner of his eye.

QUINN'S POV

Quinn sees Ryan Blood hiding behind a tree. He is taking
video of Quinn and Zoey with a "smart phone".


PARK-RIVERSIDE

Quinn jolts up. Zoey is alarmed.

                        ZOEY
          What is it?

Quinn doesn't answer. He gets up and runs to the...


TREE

Quinn looks behind the tree, but Ryan is long gone. Zoey
comes up from behind, she places her hand on Quinn's
shoulder.

                       ZOEY
          What was wrong?

                       QUINN
          My neighbor Ryan Blood...looks like he's
          spying on me.

                       ZOEY
          What are you talking about?

                       QUINN
          I need to go see Louis.


INT. RYAN BLOOD'S APARTMENT-LATER

Louis is watching the video on the smart phone. He's seen
enough, he throws it back to Ryan.

Louis tosses trash off the couch so he can sit down.

                       LOUIS
          (sitting down)
          I thought him admitting his true self
          would break them up-
                                                        44.


Ryan plops down in his computer desk chair.

                         RYAN BLOOD
            -Instead he is still hot and heavy with
            her.
            (beat)
            He even did the "bipty boom" last night.

                         LOUIS
            The fight is pointless.

                         RYAN BLOOD
            It's not pointless. The game has just
            changed is all.
             (beat)
            We have two levels here: one is making
            sure we keep him engaged.
            (beat)
            Honestly though that's an afterthought at
            this point-

                         LOUIS
            So what's the next move?

Ryan reaches into his desk drawer.

                         RYAN BLOOD
            (still searching)
            Well when he does become engaged...

Ryan throws something at Louis.

LOUIS POV

Louis catches the item. He looks down to see a nine
millimeter.
                         RYAN BLOOD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
            ...We need to make sure you still have
            the advantage.


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER

Zoey is pacing back and forth. Jack rubs his face in
frustration. He is tired of watching Zoey tear herself up
over this guy.

Anna tries to step into Zoey's path attempting to get her
attention

                         ANNA
            What are you doing?
                                                      45.


Zoey is jittery, she can't handle Anna blocking her way.

                       ZOEY
          I haven't heard from Quinn since he
          wigged out today.

                       ANNA
          Well honestly maybe that's a good thing.

                         ZOEY
          He needs me.

                       ANNA
          He doesn't need you! Not everyone needs
          you!

                       ZOEY
          (frustrated)
          This isn't about me and you-

                       ANNA
          -This is about me and you! You think you
          can make up for what happened. The fact
          you didn't notice, couldn't save me in
          time. You were a child! I was a child!
          You couldn't have saved your father
          either! Your mother couldn't have, no one
          could have! He was a fucking pedophile!

Zoey slaps Anna across the face.

                       ANNA (CONT'D)
          Hate me all you want, but it's impossible
          to redeem yourself for things you had no
          control over.
Jack is sick and tired of this display.

                       JACK
          Just show her the fucking file.

Jack gets up.

                       ZOEY
          (confused)
          What fucking file?


EXT. LOUIS APARTMENT-CONTINUOUS

Quinn runs toward Louis' apartment. His KNOCKS sound like
a jackhammer on the door.

Louis answers.
                                                       46.


                        QUINN
           We have a problem.

                        LOUIS
           You're right. We do.

Louis moves slightly and we see Ryan Blood in the
background.

Louis slowly closes the door in a stunned Quinn's face.


INT. LOUIS APARTMENT

Louis turns toward Ryan.

                        LOUIS
           I thought coming here would give us some
           privacy from Quinn.

                        RYAN BLOOD
           I think it worked out perfectly.


INT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-CONTINUOUS

Jack walks into the room holding a file folder. Zoey is
sitting on the couch trying to get a grip.

Jack throws the file in her lap.

                        ZOEY
           So is the file folder for dramatic
           effect?

                        JACK
           No it was to keep everything organized...
           (beat)
           ...and for dramatic effect.

Suddenly Zoey's cell phon rings.

She sets the folder aside and answers.

                       ZOEY
           Quinn?

INTERCUT


EXT. STREET CORNER

Quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. At this point he
is lost on what his next move should be.
                                                      47.


                        QUINN
          Ryan Blood!

                       ZOEY
          You mentioned that earlier. What is going
          on?

                       QUINN
          He's with Louis. They're planning to kill
          me.

                       ZOEY
          I thought that was the whole plan.

                       QUINN
          No it's...this isn't like Louis. I think
          he is trying to cheat his way to a win.

                       ZOEY
          Why don't you come over here.

                        QUINN
          I can't!

                       ZOEY
          Come on Quinn get a grip. Just calm down
          and come over here.

                       QUINN
          You're right.

                       ZOEY
          OK so just come on over and we'll talk.

                       QUINN
          No I mean you're right. I need to get
          control of myself. I have a destiny. I
          need to figure out my next move.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn? No wait-

Quinn hangs up the phone.


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor. Jack picks
up the folder Zoey set aside.

                        JACK
          What is it?
                                                       48.


                       ZOEY
          I don't know. He's losing it.

Jack hands her the folder.

                       JACK
          You need to look at this.

Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          I spent a lot of time gathering that
          information.

                       ZOEY
          So what is all this?

                       JACK
          Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were
          orphans.

Zoey is flipping through documents.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Quinn displayed some erratic behavior
          from the beginning. One of the staff
          members was Mormon and they would read
          stories to Quinn out of the Book Of
          Mormon. That employee was later fired,
          but a seed was planted in Quinn's head.
          He kept going on about how he and Louis
          were meant to fight to the death. Some of
          the children at the time claim Louis
          would encourage this behavior. He
          probably thought this was Quinn's attempt
          at playing.
          (beat)
          As things continued the staff at the
          orphanage thought Quinn needed help
          beyond what they could offer. They sent
          Quinn to a hospital.

Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the
floor.

                       ZOEY
          You're not telling me anything I didn't
          already know.

                       ANNA
          That makes it worse. You're going to
          continue this now that you know for a
          fact that he is nuts?
                                                         49.


                       ZOEY
          I'm too far into this now. I don't have a
          choice.

Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the
folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table.

                       JACK
          Why don't you let us save you? Please
          Zoey.

                       ZOEY
          Let me be guys.

Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack
exhausted.


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

The apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than
likely in her room sleeping.

Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's
obvious she hasn't slept all night.

She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She
proceeds to pick up the file folder.

She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few
moments she finds one of interest.

She reaches over and pushes Jack.

                       JACK
          (rousing up)
          Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of
          a man.

Jack looks up and sees Zoey.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Or Zoey...What do you need hun?

Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder.

                         ZOEY
          What's this?

Jack's eyes try to focus on the document.

                       JACK
          Looks like a room list from the psych
          hospital.
                                                        50.


                       ZOEY
          I gathered that. Under Quinn's room...

                       JACK
          Quinn and his roommate is listed.

                       ZOEY
          Quinn's roommate was Ryan Blood?

                       JACK
          Yeah...looks that way.

                         ZOEY
          Ah fuck.

                                              JUMP CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: 1 DAY LEFT


EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Louis stares out into the open field. A gust of wind
blows through his hair.

Ryan Blood comes up from behind and pats Louis on the
back.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          We need to talk.

Louis turns around to face Ryan.

                         LOUIS
          About?
                         RYAN BLOOD
          Strategy.

                         LOUIS
          Strategy?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Yes. I have a method-

                       LOUIS
          -I have to hear this.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          A 12 point system-

                       LOUIS
          (confused)
          - Like 12 steps?
                                                      51.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          Exactly. It's a sure fire plan to throw
          Quinn off of his game

Louis laughs.

                       LOUIS
          Oh I am so all ears.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Well the first thing you need is a battle
          cry.

                       LOUIS
          Excuse me? A battle cry?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Yes a battle cry. Every great warrior has
          one.

                       LOUIS
          And a battle cry is going to give me the
          advantage in battle?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Of course it will. Why don't you try one
          out?

                       LOUIS
          What?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Yeah, try one out right now. It's
          liberating.

                       LOUIS
          I'd rather not.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Come on.

                       LOUIS
          (extremely confused)
          Right here?

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Here I'll go first-

Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being
sodomized.

                       LOUIS
          That was...interesting.
                                                        52.


                          RYAN BLOOD
          See?
           (beat)
          Your turn.

Louis looks around.

                       LOUIS
          So right now?

                          RYAN BLOOD
          Of course.

Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes
out more like frightened little girl.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          Oh come on! That sounds like you are
          scared of the battle. What? Are you
          scared of Quinn? You probably are-

Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly
better.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          That's good! Come on!

Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to
jump back.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          Yes that's what I'm talking about!

Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them.

                       RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D)
          (noticing Quinn)
           Quinn?!? Good to see you!

Quinn grabs Louis' arm.

                       QUINN
          We need to talk.

                       LOUIS
          (to Ryan)
          Excuse me for a second.

Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some
distance away from Ryan.

                       QUINN
          I know that guy and I don't trust him.
                                                      53.


                       LOUIS
          I don't trust you anymore.

                       QUINN
          Your new friend is dangerous.

                         LOUIS
          So is yours.

                       QUINN
          Leave her out of this.

                       LOUIS
          You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn?

                       QUINN
          It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm
          walking away.

                       LOUIS
          Let me walk away from you first then.

Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as
he continues to walk backwards.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          I'm coming at you! You are in this game
          like it or not!


EXT. ORPHANAGE-DAY

Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick
building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the
structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess
if she has the right place.

INT. ORPHANAGE-CONTINUOUS

A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's
kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey
walks up and tries to attract his attention.

                         ZOEY
          Excuse me?

Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up
at Zoey.

                         JAKE
          (monotone)
           Yes.
                                                         54.


Jake stands.

                       ZOEY
          I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe
          the people here referred to her as
          "mother".

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
           People look for a lot of things.

Zoey is confused.

                       ZOEY
          I'm sure they do.
           (looking at the boxes)
          You guys shutting down?

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
           We are ceasing operations.

                       ZOEY
          Is there something wrong with you?

MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of
the back.

                       MRS. RHODES
          Calm down. You need to calm down and
          count to ten.

                       ZOEY
          What? I don't know what that means.

Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps
them up and down in her face.

                       MRS. RHODES
          You have to calm down and meditate.

                       ZOEY
          Um...no...listen do you know Quinn Wilson
          and Louis Marks? They grew up here.

Mrs. Rhodes steps back like a vampire who has just seen a
cross.

                       MRS. RHODES
          No...You need to leave!

                       ZOEY
          What?
                                                      55.


                       MRS. RHODES
          And give me your shirt.

                       ZOEY
          Um...no.

Zoey turns around and starts to leave. Mrs. Rhodes starts
screaming at the top of her lungs.

                       MRS. RHODES
          You better make your peace with God girl!
          The end is coming, those boys are
          ushering in a new era!

Zoey runs down the hallway toward the front door.


EXT. ORPHANAGE

Zoey runs outside and makes it to her car. She hits the
roof of her vehicle in anger

                       ZOEY
          What a fucking nut house!

                       JAKE (O.S.)
          (monotone)
          Excuse me!

Zoey jumps up and screams. She sees Jake standing
creepily behind her.

                       ZOEY
          What!

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
          I know the young boys you speak of.

                       ZOEY
          (doesn't care)
          And?

                       JAKE
          (monotone)
          I was here when Quinn got sent to the
          mental hospital. It was like the other
          one set it up.

                       ZOEY
          Wait Louis? You think Louis made Quinn
          appear crazy?
                                                         56.


                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           They both believed the same thing. Louis
           was just smart enough to hide it.

                        ZOEY
           There is more to it than that.

                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           I don't understand

                        ZOEY
           Listen "Robot Boy", where did this whole
           belief come from? This isn't something
           two kids come up with on their own.

                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           Yes I believe a seed was planted.

                        ZOEY
           Exactly. I heard there was an employee
           that got fired for sharing Mormon
           mythology with the boys.

                        JAKE
           (monotone)
           No. Off base. He's not the right one.

INTERCUT


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits at the PC while chatting away on his cell
phone. It appears he is looking up information for who
ever is on the other end.


INT.ZOEY'S CAR- CONTINUOUS

Zoey is parked in a parking lot, while she chats on her
cell phone with Jack.

                        JACK
           You might be right sweetheart. The
           employee I was telling you about earlier
           was instrumental in getting Appleridge
           Orphanage shut down.

                       ZOEY
           How?
                                            57.


             JACK
Mrs. Rhodes was pretty well known in
Huntington. I think she felt this guy was
getting in the way of her master plan.
Finally, nearly 20 years later, he
convinced the state what was really going
on there.

             ZOEY
Well...elaborate.

             JACK
That girl you talked to was "pants
crapping nuts". She actually makes your
boyfriend look sane. I guess she believes
that Lucifer came to her in a vision-

             ZOEY
-How is that different than a dream? Just
saying-

             JACK
-I don't know. I think you have to be
awake for a vision.
(beat)
Will you please pay attention? Anyway he,
meaning Lucifer, gave her this jazz
about...well you know the story. Two
angels, fighting to the
death...blah...blah...Anyway he told her
she needed to look after Louis and get
Quinn out of there. I guess trying to
stack the odds in Louis' favor.

             ZOEY
So she had Quinn committed?
             JACK
To the same hospital where her nephew was
a patient. All on the dark lord's orders
I guess.

             ZOEY
Fucking Ryan Blood!

             JACK
Your friends are fucking whack.

               ZOEY
Thanks Jack.

             JACK
So what are you going to do?
                                                         58.


                       ZOEY
          I'm going to stop an Apocalyptic battle.

                       JACK
          Goddamn Zoey!


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT

Jack realizes Zoey hung up on him. He slowly puts his
phone down and steps away from the computer.

He walks over to the couch and sits down. He lets out a
sigh of exhaustion as he leans back on the couch.


ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-A FEW HOURS LATER

Jack is now sprawled out on the couch. Anna walks in the
room and sets a beverage on the coffee table in front of
him.

She moves his legs and sits down beside of him.

                       ANNA
          So where is she at now?

Jack sits up.

                       JACK
          I got a text about thirty minutes ago.
          I'm pretty sure she is going to head to
          Quinn's apartment.

                       ANNA
          Jack...
                       JACK
          What?

                       ANNA
          Her Christ Complex is going to get her
          killed.

                       JACK
          Trust me I know Anna.
          (beat)
          I know...

KNOCKING is heard at the door. Anna gets up to answer.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Maybe it's Quinn the jackass.
                                                      59.


Anna just gets the door opened a crack when...

Ryan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis
restrains her against a wall.

Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to
the head from Ryan.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          Good afternoon boys and girls! I need
          your assistance.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Quinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is
sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a
while.

                       QUINN
          How do people keep ending up in my room?

                       ZOEY
          (laughs)
          You need to learn to lock up.

Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her.

                       QUINN
          I'm not fighting Louis.

                       ZOEY
          Why the change of heart?

                       QUINN
          I think you might be right. I don't think
          it's necessary. I think the world will
          keep turning one way or another. I'm not
          dependant on that.
           (beat)
          I'm not a savior.

                       ZOEY
          Do you really believe? You know?

                       QUINN
          Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually.
          Since I have been with you, I've doubted
          what I know to be fact though. Then it
          hit me, it really doesn't matter.

                       ZOEY
          I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do
          it for myself...
                       (MORE)
                                                         60.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          I don't want to do it because I feel I
          have to. Obligations, or dark incidents
          from my past...That's not a reason to
          help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish
          actually.

                       QUINN
          You're not selfish Zoey.

                       ZOEY
          I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely
          my reason for wanting to do this. That's
          a first for me you know?

                         QUINN
          I know...

Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed
together.

                                             JUMP CUT TO:


QUINN'S ROOM- LATER

Quinn gets pistol whipped across the face. Suddenly we
see Louis picking Zoey up by the hair.

                         QUINN
          (in pain)
           Let her go!

Louis has a hold of Zoey. Quinn gets up and goes for
Ryan.

Louis drop kicks Quinn and sends him flying across the
room.

Louis throws Zoey at Ryan. Ryan then holds her at gun
point.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          (looking at Quinn)
          Let me pretty the girl up a bit

Ryan beats her repeatedly with the gun until she passes
out cold from the trauma.

Quinn tries to get to his feet, but Louis kicks him back
down.

                       LOUIS
          Hold on sunshine!
                                                           61.


Ryan throws Louis the gun.

QUINN'S POV

We see Louis with great force repeatedly hit Quinn with
the gun. Everything goes fuzzy and then we...

                                                       CUT TO:

BLACKNESS


INT. QUINN'S ROOM-HOURS LATER

Quinn slowly gets to his feet. He walks over to the
doorway and kneels down.

He sees a puddle of blood...Zoey's blood. He puts his
fingers in it. He inspects his hand, rubbing the blood
between his index finger and thumb.

He jumps up and screams in anger. That would be Quinn's
version of a battle cry.

CLOSE SHOT-JACK'S FACE

A hand rips duct tape off of Jack's mouth. He let's out a
loud scream.

                         JACK
            Mother fucker!


INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT- CONTINOUS

Quinn crouches down beside Jack.
Jack and Anna are both tied up, Anna still has duct tape
across her mouth. You can hear her muffled screams as
they fill the room.

                         QUINN
            Where's Zoey?

                         JACK
            Fuck you mother fucker! I'm going to call
            the fucking fuzz once you untie me!
            Fucking nut bag, ball sac-

                         QUINN
            (like he is talking to a retarded child)
            I...will...come...rescue...you
                                                         62.


                       JACK
          Ass fuck salad-

Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even
though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still
running off at the mouth.

                       QUINN
          That actually felt kind of good.

Quinn pats Jack on the head.

                       QUINN (CONT'D)
          I'll be back guys.

Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard
through out the apartment.

CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED

A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We
see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it.

Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt.


INT. QUINN'S ROOM

Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight.
He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking
like the Bride from Kill Bill.

He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second.
He's preparing his next move.

Bad ass comic book pose...'nuff said.
                                                  CUT TO:

TITLE CARD: DAY ZERO THE ENDGAME

DREAM SEQUENCE

START CHOIR MUSIC


INT. CHURCH

The front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the
sanctuary. Zoey walks through the doors.

She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's,
kneeling. It appears he might be praying.
                                                         63.


She places her hand on his shoulder. As he turns around
she sees her Dad.

                       ZOEY
          I'm not doing it anymore. You will not
          have redemption from me.

                          DAD
          (raspy)
           Zoey...

He reaches for her, she pulls away. She starts to back
up.

                       ZOEY
          Take ownership of what you did. Don't
          rely on me to save you. I need to start
          saving myself.

She slowly backs up and then turns to walk away.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          (as she is turning)
          Goodbye.

CLOSE SHOT- ZOEY'S FACE

Ryan slaps Zoey in the face to wake her up.

EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY

Ryan pulls Zoey up to her feet. He presses the gun
against her head.

Louis walks out into the middle of the field. He's
dressed in a full ninja outfit.

He unsheathes his katana.

                       LOUIS
          What do you think Zoey? I'm a ninja!

                       ZOEY
          (struggling under Ryan's grip)
          You're fucking crazy!
                                           64.


             LOUIS
That's not nice! I think I look good.

             ZOEY
I think you're a fucking nut bag.

             LOUIS
This is going to be fun. You'll see.

             ZOEY
Mrs Rhodes? Does that name ring a bell?

            RYAN BLOOD
My aunt?

             LOUIS
Yeah...yeah...she played a part in the
game. Tell us something we don't know.
You're such a sexy Nancy Drew right now.

             ZOEY
Go fuck yourself.

             LOUIS
Or a foul mouthed Velma. That gets me so
hard. Does that get you hard Ryan?

             RYAN BLOOD
Can we go back to my aunt please?

             ZOEY
Mrs. Rhodes? What about her? Other than
she fucked you guys up. She taught you,
Louis how to play it straight. Then she
has you fuck Quinn over.
             RYAN BLOOD
She didn't fuck Quinn over. She just
helped him out.

             ZOEY
Yeah by getting him in contact with you.

             RYAN BLOOD
She knew one day it was all going to
catch up with her. She trained me to get
into the game. She told me it was my
destiny.

             ZOEY
Is that why she placed you in that
hospital?
                                                         65.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          She was my caretaker. She told me she was
          sending me someone. Someone I would have
          to guide on to the right path.

                       ZOEY
          Guys I have let my parents fuck me up.
          There comes a time though where you have
          to go out on your own. Take
          responsibility for your own life.

                       RYAN BLOOD
          There is a much bigger purpose. You'll
          see.

                       ZOEY
          This whole thing was to carry out some
          delusional woman's master plan. She
          doesn't even remember who she is at this
          point. I went to see her...she wanted me
          to take off my shirt.

Louis is irritated.

                       LOUIS
          Will you shut up?!? You are ruining my
          climatic fight.

Louis spies Quinn in the distance.

                          LOUIS (CONT'D)
          Showtime.

START CHOIR MUSIC

Quinn lowers his katana, it brushes against the blades of
grass. Louis follows suit as he slowly walks to meet
Quinn in the middle.

The two warriors stand on opposite sides of the battle
field.

END CHOIR MUSIC

Quinn looks over and sees Zoey.

                          QUINN
          Let her go!

Ryan grabs her tighter.

                          RYAN BLOOD
          Not yet...
                                            66.


             QUINN
(To Louis)
Is this the game you want to play?

             LOUIS
I'm not going to lose this time.

             ZOEY
(To Quinn)
I thought you didn't believe this shit
anymore.

             QUINN
There's more going on than you realize
Zoey.

             ZOEY
This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000
years old. You were born in an orphanage.
None of this makes sense.

             LOUIS
Lady, it would look weird if we roamed
the earth for 5000 years without facing a
mortal death! We keep getting reborn,
sometimes we even switch physical form.
Thanks for coming to the game late missy!

             ZOEY
That makes total fucking sense. Color me
stupid!

             QUINN
(to Louis)
 You don't get it do you.
             LOUIS
What?!?

             QUINN
If you win...you're not becoming the
antichrist.

             LOUIS
What are you talking about??

              QUINN
It's   Ryan...it's always been Ryan.

             LOUIS
(To Ryan)
What is he talking about?
                                                      67.


                       RYAN BLOOD
          He's pitting us against each other.

                       QUINN
          I'm going to be honest with you Louis.
          I've always been honest.

                       LOUIS
          Yeah sometimes to a fault.

                       QUINN
          We have always played this game as honest
          as we could. We never did anything to
          undermine the other. Despite what you
          represent, you have moral code.
          (beat)
          You are not acting with in that code
          today.

                       LOUIS
          I'm tired of losing...

                       QUINN
          You're losing right now. Your actions,
          you can't win like this. Not acting this
          way.

                       LOUIS
          I'm tired of you. I'm going to end it!

Louis goes over to Ryan. He trades his sword in for
Ryan's gun.

Ryan holds the katana to Zoey's throat. Louis points the
gun dead at Quinn.
                       QUINN
          You going to shoot me?

                       LOUIS
          It's the endgame.

Tense moment as Louis aims the gun at Quinn.

SUDDENLY he spins and shoots Ryan dead in the head.

Ryan falls and Zoey gets free.

Louis looks at Quinn and then throws the gun far out into
the field.

                       LOUIS (CONT'D)
          OK...I guess I do have some morals.
                                                        68.


Zoey gets her bearings.

                       ZOEY
          What the fuck!

                       QUINN
          Zoey go home. We need to finish this.

Louis walks over to Ryan and grabs his katana.

                       ZOEY
          No you don't. Guys what are you doing?

                       LOUIS
          Go home girl!

                       ZOEY
          Are you being serious?

Quinn stops and turns toward Zoey.

                       QUINN
          I will always love you. You have to go
          though.

                       ZOEY
          If you don't walk away from this field
          right now, you will lose me. I will not
          be in your corner. I will call for help.
          They will stop you.

                          QUINN
          Go...

                       ZOEY
          Quinn...last chance.
Zoey walks over to Ryan's body. She searches till she
finds her cell phone in his front pocket.

                       ZOEY (CONT'D)
          I will call the police Quinn...

Quinn looks at Zoey, dead in the eyes.

                          QUINN
          Goodbye.

Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to
attack position and Louis follows suit.

                       ZOEY
          (tearing up)
          Wow...yeah goodbye.
                                                        69.


Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to
stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away.

Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant.
Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by
the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers
film.

We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at
it until we can't tell who is who.


OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE

Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone.

CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE

She starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position
to hit send.


OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD

Zoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks
back toward where the battle is going on.

She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog.
Finally the jog turns into a full run.


OPEN FIELD

When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All
that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an
empty ninja suit.
Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana.

                          ZOEY
             (laughs to herself)
             I am Curious:Yellow
             (beat)
             Goodbye boys...

Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn.
She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her
beyond the horizon.

                                                  CUT TO:

INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALL

The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old
Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front
that reads: Marshal University Association of Free
Thought.

                       ZOEY
          For years we have thought absence of the
          impossible indicated that we were
          exercising free thought. In my experience
          ladies and gentleman, that's not the
          case.
          (beat)
          Believing in hope my friends, opening
          yourself up to accepting there might be
          more than the world around you. That's
          truly being a free thinker.

The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face.


EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER

Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her
great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down
beside her grandmother.

                         JENNIFER
          Hey Grandma.

                         ZOEY
          Hey...

                       JENNIFER
          You look solemn.
                       ZOEY
          Just sitting here...thinking...

                       JENNIFER
          What are you thinking about?

                       ZOEY
          I've had a great life. A wonderful
          husband, children, grandchildren...
          (motions to Jennifer)
          ...great grandchildren...I spent so much
          of my youth being angry. I wish I could
          relive my life now, knowing what I know.

                       JENNIFER
          You do have a lot of wisdom.
                                                         71.


                       ZOEY
          I've tried to pass it on to you.

                       JENNIFER
          You've taught me a lot.

                       ZOEY
          Just remember, you can believe what you
          want to believe Jennifer. Live by what
          ever moral code you want to live by. Just
          make sure it's yours. Don't let it stem
          from anger or past tragedies.
          (beat)
          Let it come from your heart.

Jennifer turns around.

                         ZOEY (CONT'D)
          What is it?

                       JENNIFER
          My new boyfriend. The one I wanted you to
          meet.

Zoey turns around to see the BOYFRIEND walking toward
them. It shouldn't come to a surprise that he looks a lot
like Quinn.

Jennifer gets up and grabs her boyfriend around the
waist. He reaches his hand out to Zoey.

                       BOYFRIEND
          (nervous)
          Nice to meet to ma'am.

                       ZOEY
          (shakes his hand)
          Likewise.

Jennifer grabs his hand right after his handshake with
Zoey.

                       JENNIFER
          We better get going. We're going to grab
          something to eat.

                       ZOEY
          (to the boyfriend)
          I didn't catch your name.

                       BOYFRIEND
          I'm so sorry. I'm being rude.
                                                         72.


                       JENNIFER
          (laughs)
          He can be like that.

                          BOYFRIEND
          I'm Louis.

Zoey is stunned.

                          JENNIFER
          (to Zoey)
          You OK?

                       ZOEY
          Yeah I'm fine.
          (snapping out of it)
           Enjoy dinner.

                       JENNIFER
          See you later on.

                       BOYFRIEND
          (making eye contact with Zoey, smiling)
          Nice to meet you.

                       ZOEY
          (returning contact, and smiles)
          Likewise.

The two lovebirds walk away. Zoey stares at them for a
second. A it "can't be look" crosses her face.

START "DONE AND DUSTED'

CLOSE UP-ZOEY'S FACE
Zoey smiles almost to say to the camera that there is
more out there. Things that we don't fully understand.
The smile then fades.

Her final look is that of content. And then as Done and
Dusted plays we...

                                                FADE OUT.

	INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS

	A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

	A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

	A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
	Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
	Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
	askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
	corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
	atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
	resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR
	swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE
	rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking
	it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
	back to the camera, phone in hand.

				FIGURE
			(groggily)
		Hello...What?...No, I don't work
		today...I'm playing hockey at two.

	THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

				FIGURE (O.C.)
		Why don't you call Randal?...
		Because I'm fucking tired....I just
		closed last night....
			(deep sigh)
		Jesus...What time are you going to
		come in?...Twelve...Be there be
		twelve?...Swear...

	A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
	decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

				FIGURE (O.C.)
		Swear you'll be in by twelve and
		I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
		walk.

	THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
	slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
	and stands.

	THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
	Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
	is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is
	Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

				DANTE
		Next time, I get the bed.

										2.


	He releases the dog and sits up.

				DANTE
			(exhausted)
		Shit.

						CUT TO:

	INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER

	A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
	the toilet.

						CUT TO:

	INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER

	A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
	grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

						CUT TO:

	INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER

	Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
	scoops, three scoops, four scoops.

						CUT TO:

	INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER

	DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
	for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
	THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

						CUT TO:

	INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER

	DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
	atop a VCR.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER

	A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

						CUT TO:

										3.


	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
	from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
	it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
	store.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
	lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
	convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
	camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
	knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack
	remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.
	Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
	the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
	to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
	PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
	papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
	his eyes as it occurs to him.

				DANTE
		Shit.

	The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE

	Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
	approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
	the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he
	reaches toward the camera.

	DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
	vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
	as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
	the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
	him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

						CUT TO:

										4.


	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
	flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
	looks down at it.

				DANTE
		Shit!

	The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
	obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.
	DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car
	trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a
	folded white sheet.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

				DANTE
		Thanks. Have a good one.

				ACTIVIST
		Do you mind if I drink this here?

				DANTE
		Sure. Go ahead.

	The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.
	Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.

				CUSTOMER
		Are you open?

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.

				ACTIVIST
		Are you sure?

				CUSTOMER
		Am I sure?

				ACTIVIST
		Are you sure?

				CUSTOMER
		Am I sure about what?

				ACTIVIST
		Do you really want to buy those
		cigarettes?

				CUSTOMER
		Are you serious?

				ACTIVIST
		How long have you been smoking?

				CUSTOMER
			(to DANTE)
		What is this, a poll?

				DANTE
		Beats me.

										6.


				ACTIVIST
		How long have you been a smoker?

				CUSTOMER
		Since I was thirteen.

	The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
	it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

				ACTIVIST
		I'd say you're about nineteen,
		twenty, am I right?

				CUSTOMER
		What the hell is that?

				ACTIVIST
		That's your lung. By this time,
		your lung looks like this.

				CUSTOMER
		You're shittin' me.

				ACTIVIST
		You think I'm shitting you...

	The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

				CUSTOMER
		What's this?

				ACTIVIST
		It's a trach ring. It's what they
		install in your throat when throat
		cancer takes your voice box. This
		one came out of a sixty-year-old man.

				CUSTOMER
			(drops ring)
		Unnhh!

				ACTIVIST
			(picks up the ring)
		He smoked until the day he died.
		Used to put the cigarette in this
		thing and smoke it that way.

				DANTE
		Excuse me, but...

										7.


				ACTIVIST
		This is where you're heading. A
		cruddy lung, smoking through a hole
		in your throat. Do you really want
		that?

				CUSTOMER
		Well, if it's already too late...

				ACTIVIST
		It's never too late. Give those
		cigarettes back now, and buy some
		gum instead.
			(grabs nearby pack, reads)
		Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

				CUSTOMER
		It's not the same.

				ACTIVIST
		It's cheaper than cigarettes. And
		it certainly beats this.

	Hands him a picture.

				CUSTOMER
		Jesus!

				ACTIVIST
		It's a picture of a cancer-ridden
		lung. Keep it.

				CUSTOMER
			(to DANTE)
		I'll just take the gum.

				DANTE
		Fifty-five.

				ACTIVIST
		You've made a wise choice. Keep up
		the good work.

	The CUSTOMER exits.

				DANTE
		Maybe you should take that coffee
		outside.

				ACTIVIST
		No, I think I'll drink it in here,
		thanks.

										8.


				DANTE
		If you're going to drink it in
		here, I'd appreciate it if you'd
		not bother the customers.

				ACTIVIST
		Okay. I'm sorry about that.

	Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.
			(looks at model)
		What's that?

				ACTIVIST
		This? How long have you been smoking?

	A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT
	BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
	SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam
	dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

				JAY
		WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!

	SILENT BOB lights a smoke.

				JAY
		I feel good today, Silent Bob.
		We're gonna make some money! And

		What you looking at?! I'll kick

			(to SILENT BOB)
		Doesn't that motherfucker still owe

	SILENT BOB nods.

		Tonight, you and me are going off

		Wa sup sluts?

		Damn Silent Bob! You one rude

		And then, I wanna line up three

	JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,
	looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little
	humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.

				JAY
		Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I

		Neh.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It
	has become something of a rally.

									10.


				ACTIVIST
		You're spending what? Twenty,
		thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.

				LISTENER 1
		Forty.

				LISTENER 2
		Fifty-three.

				ACTIVIST
		Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay
		someone that much money every week
		to kill you? Because that's what
		you're doing now, by paying for the
		so-called privilege to smoke!

				LISTENER 3
		We all gotta go sometime...

				ACTIVIST
		It's that kind of mentality that
		allows this cancer-producing
		industry to thrive. Of course we're
		all going to die someday, but do we
		have to pay for it? Do we have to
		actually throw hard-earned dollars
		on a counter and say, "Please,
		please, Mister Merchant of Death,
		sir; please sell me something that
		will give me bad breath, stink up
		my clothes, and fry my lungs."

				LISTENER 1
		It's not that easy to quit.

				ACTIVIST
		Of course it's not; not when you
		have people like this mindless
		cretin so happy and willing to sell
		you nails for your coffin!

				DANTE
		Hey, now wait a sec...

				ACTIVIST
		Now he's going to launch into his
		rap about how he's just doing his
		job; following orders.
				(MORE)

									11.


				ACTIVIST (CONT'D)
		Friends, let me tell you about
		another bunch of hate mongers that
		were just following orders: they
		were called Nazis, and they
		practically wiped a nation of
		people from the Earth...just like
		cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
		smoking is the new Holocaust, and
		those that partake in the practice
		of smoking or sell the wares that
		promote it are the Nazis of the
		nineties! He doesn't care how many
		people die from it! He smiles as
		you pay for your cancer sticks and
		says, "Have a nice day."

				DANTE
		I think you'd better leave now.

				ACTIVIST
		You want me to leave? Why? Because
		somebody is telling it like it is?
		Somebody's giving these fine people
		a wake-up call?!

				DANTE
		You're loitering in here, and
		causing a disturbance.

				ACTIVIST
		You're the disturbance, pal! And
		here...
			(slaps a dollar on
			the counter)
		I'm buying some...what's
		this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm
		no longer loitering. I'm a customer,
		a customer engaged in a discussion
		with other customers.

				LISTENER 2
			(to DANTE)
		Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!

				ACTIVIST
		Oh, he's scared now! He sees the
		threat we present! He smells the
		changes coming, and the loss of
		sales when the nonsmokers finally
		demand satisfaction. We demand the
		right to breathe cleaner air!

									12.


				LISTENER 3
		Yeah!

				ACTIVIST
		We'd rather chew our gum than
		embrace slow death! Let's abolish
		this heinous practice of sucking
		poison, and if it means ruffling
		the feathers of a convenience store
		idiot, then so be it!

				DANTE
		That's it, everybody out.

				ACTIVIST
		We're not moving! We have a right,
		a constitutional right, to assemble
		and be heard!

				DANTE
		Yeah, but not in here.

				ACTIVIST
		What better place than this? To
		stamp it out, you gotta start at
		the source!

				DANTE
		Like I'm responsible for all the
		smokers!

				ACTIVIST
		The ones in this town, yes! You
		encourage their growth, their habit.
		You're the source in this area, and
		we're going to shut you down for
		good! For good, cancer-merchant!

	The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

				CROWD
		Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
		Cancer merchant!

	VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
	cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
	loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
	throng. Everyone turns to face...

	VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
	a fire extinguisher.

				VERONICA
		Who's leading this mob?

									13.


	The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

				SOMEONE
		That guy.

	The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
	the door.

				VERONICA (O.C.)
		Freeze.

	VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
	the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

				VERONICA
		Let's see some credentials.

	He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
	nozzle at him, warningly.

				VERONICA
		Slowly...

	He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
	it.

				VERONICA
		You're a Chewlie's Gum
		representative?

	He nods.

				VERONICA
		And you're stirring up all this
		antismoking sentiment
		to...what?...sell more gum?

	He nods again.

				VERONICA
			(through gritted teeth)
		Get out of here.

	He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
	exits.

				VERONICA
			(to the crowd)
		And you people: Don't you have jobs
		to go to? Get out of here and go
		commute.

	The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic
	glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.

									14.


	VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

				VERONICA
		You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
		Easily led automatons. Try thinking
		for yourself before you pelt and
		innocent man with cigarettes.

	The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
	extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
	floor, head in his folded arms.

				VERONICA
		It looked like Tiananmen Square in
		here for a second.

	DANTE is silent.

				VERONICA
		"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
		from an extremely ugly mob scene."

	DANTE remains silent.

				VERONICA
			(sits beside him)
		Okay, champ. What's wrong?

	DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

				VERONICA
		All right, stupid question. But
		don't you think you're taking this
		a bit too hard?

				DANTE
		Too hard?! I don't have enough
		indignities in my life-people start
		throwing cigarettes at me!

				VERONICA
		At least they weren't lit.

				DANTE
		I hate this fucking place.

				VERONICA
		Then quit. You should be going to
		school anyway...

				DANTE
		Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
		is a lecture at this point.

									15.


				VERONICA
		All I'm saying is that if you're
		unhappy you should leave.

				DANTE
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

				VERONICA
		I know. I stopped by your house and
		your mom said you left at like six
		or something.

				DANTE
		The guy got sick and couldn't come
		in.

				VERONICA
		Don't you have a hockey game at two?

				DANTE
		Yes! And I'm going to play like
		shit because I didn't get a good
		night's sleep!

				VERONICA
		Why did you agree to come in then?

				DANTE
		I'm only here until twelve, then
		I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

				VERONICA
		Why don't you open the shutters and
		get some sunlight in here?

				DANTE
		Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

				VERONICA
		You're kidding.

				DANTE
		Bunch of savages in this town.

				VERONICA
		You look bushed. What time did you
		get to bed?

				DANTE
		I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

				VERONICA
		What were you doing up so late?

									16.


				DANTE
			(skirting)
		Hunhh? Nothing.

				VERONICA
			(persistent)
		What were you doing?

				DANTE
		Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
		you now?

				VERONICA
		Who's fighting? Why are you so
		defensive?

				DANTE
		Who's defensive? Just...Would you
		just hug me?! All right? Your
		boyfriend was accosted by an angry
		mob, and he needs to be hugged.

	She stares at him.

				DANTE
		What? What is that?

				VERONICA
		She called you, didn't she?

				DANTE
		Oh, be real! Would you...Would you
		please hug me? I just went through
		a very traumatic experience and I
		haven't been having the best day so
		far. Now come on.

	VERONICA stares at him.

				DANTE
		What? What's with that look?! I
		wasn't talking to anyone, especially
		her! Look at you, being all sort
		of...I don't know...stand-offish.

	VERONICA looks away.

				DANTE
		Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug
		me. I see how it is. All right
		Pissy-pants, you just go on being
		suspicious and quiet. I don't even
		want to hug you at this point.

									17.


	VERONICA looks back at him.

				DANTE
			(pleadingly)
		Give you a dollar?

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:

	PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN
	APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.

	DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the
	counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her
	chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.

				DANTE
			(to O.C. customer)
		Thanks.

	The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.

				VERONICA
		How much money did you leave up
		there?

				DANTE
		Like three dollars in mixed change
		and a couple of singles. People
		only get the paper of coffee this
		time of morning.

				VERONICA
		You're trusting.

				DANTE
		Why do you say that?

				VERONICA
		How do you know they're taking the
		right amount of change? Or even
		paying for what they take?

				DANTE
		Theoretically, people see money on
		the counter and nobody around, they
		think they're being watched.

				VERONICA
		Honesty through paranoia. Why do
		you smell like shoe polish?

									18.


				DANTE
		I had to use shoe polish to make
		that sign. The smell won't come off.

				VERONICA
		Do you think anyone can see us down
		here?

				DANTE
		Why? You wanna have sex or something?

				VERONICA
			(sarcastic)
		Ooh! Can we?!

				DANTE
		Really?

				VERONICA
		I was kidding.

				DANTE
		Yeah, right. You can't get enough
		of me.

				VERONICA
		Typically male point of view.

				DANTE
		How do you figure?

				VERONICA
		You show some bedroom proficiency,
		and you think you're gods. What
		about what we do for you?

				DANTE
		Women? Women, as lovers, are all
		basically the same: they just have
		to be there.

				VERONICA
		"Be there?"

				DANTE
		Making a male climax is not all
		that challenging: insert somewhere
		close and preferably moist; thrust;
		repeat.

				VERONICA
		How flattering.

									19.


				DANTE
		Now, making a woman cum...therein
		lies a challenge.

				VERONICA
		Oh, you think so?

				DANTE
		A girl makes a guy cum, it's
		standard. A guy makes a girl cum,
		it's talent.

				VERONICA
		And I actually date you?

				DANTE
		Something wrong?

				VERONICA
		I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
		it takes more than that to get a
		guy off. Just "being there"-as you
		put it-is not enough.

				DANTE
		I touched a nerve.

				VERONICA
		I'm astonished to hear you
		trivialize my role in our sex life.

				DANTE
		It wasn't directed at you. I was
		making a broad generalization.

				VERONICA
		You were making a generalization
		about "broads!"

				DANTE
		These are my opinions based on my
		experiences with the few women who
		were good enough to sleep with me.

				VERONICA
		How many?

				DANTE
		How many what?

				VERONICA
		How many girls have you slept with?

									20.


				DANTE
		How many different girls? Didn't we
		already have this discussion once?

				VERONICA
		We might have; I don't remember.
		How many?

				DANTE
		Including you?

				VERONICA
		It better be up to and including me.

				DANTE
			(pause to count)
		Twelve.

				VERONICA
		You've slept with twelve different
		girls?

				DANTE
		Including you; yes.

	Pause. She slaps him.

				DANTE
		What the hell was that for?

				VERONICA
		You're a pig.

				DANTE
		Why'd you hit me?

				VERONICA
		Do you know how many different men
		I've had sex with?

				DANTE
		Do I get to hit you after you tell
		me?

				VERONICA
		Three.

				DANTE
		Three?

				VERONICA
		Three including you.

									21.


				DANTE
		You've only had sex with three
		different people?

				VERONICA
		I'm not the pig you are.

				DANTE
		Who?

				VERONICA
		You!

				DANTE
		No; who were the three, besides me?

				VERONICA
		John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

				DANTE
			(with true admiration)
		Wow. That's great. That's something
		to be proud of.

				VERONICA
		I am. And that's why you should
		feel like a pig. You men make me
		sick. You'll sleep with anything
		that says yes.

				DANTE
		Animal, vegetable, or mineral.

				VERONICA
		Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

				DANTE
		They put up the least amount of
		struggle.

				VERONICA
		After dropping a bombshell like
		that, you owe me. Big.

				DANTE
		All right. Name it.

				VERONICA
		I want you to come with me on Monday.

				DANTE
		Where?

									22.


				VERONICA
		To school. There's a seminar about
		getting back into a scholastic
		program after a lapse in enrollment.

				DANTE
		Can't we ever have a discussion
		without that coming up?

				VERONICA
		It's important to me, Dante. You
		have so much potential that just
		goes to waste in this pit. I wish
		you'd go back to school.

				DANTE
		Jesus, would you stop? You make my
		head hurt when you talk about this.

	VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.

				DANTE
		Shit! Why are we getting up?

				VERONICA
		Unlike you, I have a class in
		forty-five minutes.

	A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.
	VERONICA reacts to him.

				VERONICA
			(surprised)
		Willam!

				WILLAM
		Ronnie! How are you? You work here
		now?

				VERONICA
			(locks arms with DANTE)
		No, I'm just visiting my man.
			(to DANTE)
		Dante, this is Willam Black.
			(to WILLAM)
		This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

				DANTE
		How are you? Just the soda?

				WILLAM
		And a pack of cigarettes.
			(to VERONICA; paying)
		Are you still going to Seton Hall?

									23.


				VERONICA
		No, I transferred into Monmouth
		this year. I was tired of missing
		him.
			(squeezes DANTE'S arm)


				WILLAM
		Do you still talk to Sylvan?

				VERONICA
		I just talked to her on Monday. We
		still hang out on weekends.

				WILLAM
			(leaving)
		That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds
		take it easy, all right?

				VERONICA
		I will. Take it easy.

				WILLAM
		Bye.
			(exits)


				VERONICA
		Bye
			(to DANTE)
		That was Snowball.

				DANTE
		Why do you call him that?

				VERONICA
		Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job
		thing.

				DANTE
		What do you mean?

				VERONICA
		After he gets a blow job, he likes
		to have the cum spit back into his
		mouth while kissing. It's called
		snowballing.

				DANTE
		He requested this?

				VERONICA
		He gets off on it.

									24.


				DANTE
		Sylvan can be talked into anything.

				VERONICA
		Why do you say that?

				DANTE
		Like you said-she snowballed him.

				VERONICA
		Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.

				DANTE
		Yeah, right.

				VERONICA
		I'm serious...

	A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.

				DANTE
		You sucked that guy's dick?

				VERONICA
		Yeah. How do you think I know he
		liked...

				DANTE
			(panicky)
		But...but you said you only had sex
		with three guys! You never mentioned
		him!

				VERONICA
		That's because I never had sex with
		him!

				DANTE
		You sucked his dick!

				VERONICA
		We went out a few times. We didn't
		have sex, but we fooled around.

				DANTE
			(massive panic attack)
		Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
		only slept with three guys?

				VERONICA
		Because I did only sleep with three
		guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
		just go with people.

									25.


				DANTE
		Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...

				VERONICA
		I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
		understood.

				DANTE
		I did understand! I understand that
		you slept with three different
		guys, and that's all you said.

				VERONICA
		Please calm down.

				DANTE
		How many?

				VERONICA
		Dante...

				DANTE
		How many dicks have you sucked?!

				VERONICA
		Let it go...

				DANTE
		HOW MANY?

				VERONICA
		All right! Shut up a second and
		I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't
		freak like this when you told me
		how many girls you fucked.

				DANTE
		This is different. This is important.
		How many?!

	She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on
	a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.

				DANTE
		Well...?

				VERONICA
			(half-mumbled)
		Something like thirty-six.

				DANTE
		WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?

									26.


				VERONICA
		Lower your voice!

				DANTE
		What the hell is that anyway,
		"something like thirty-six?" Does
		that include me?

				VERONICA
		Um. Thirty-seven.

				DANTE
		I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?

				VERONICA
			(walking away)
		I'm going to class.

				DANTE
		Thirty-seven?!
			(to CUSTOMER)
		My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven
		dicks!

				CUSTOMER
		In a row?

	DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.

				DANTE
		Hey! Where are you going?!

				VERONICA
		Hey listen, jerk! Until today you
		never even knew how many guys I'd
		slept with, because you never even
		asked. And then you act all
		nonchalant about fucking twelve
		different girls. Well, I never had
		sex with twelve different guys!

				DANTE
		No, but you sucked enough dick!

				VERONICA
		Yeah, I went down on a few guys...

				DANTE
		A few?

									27.


				VERONICA
		...And one of those guys was you!
		The last one, I might add, which-if
		you're too stupid to comprehend-
		means that I've been faithful to
		you since we met! All the other
		guys I went with before I met you,
		so, if you want to have a complex
		about it, go ahead! But don't look
		at me like I'm the town whore,
		because you were plenty busy
		yourself, before you met me!

				DANTE
			(a bit more rational)
		Well...why did you have to suck
		their dicks? Why didn't you just
		sleep with them, like any decent

		No; he was probably just resting

		Party at John K's-senior year. I

				RANDAL
		That's cheating?

				DANTE
		In the middle of it, she calls me
		Brad.

				RANDAL
		She called you Brad?

				DANTE
		She called me Brad.

				RANDAL
		That's not cheating. People say

		called this girl "Mom."

				DANTE
		I hit the lights and she freaks.
		Turns out she thought I was Brad
		Michaelson.

				RANDAL
		What do you mean?

				DANTE
		She was supposed to meet Brad
		Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked

		Oh, my God.

		Great story, isn't it?

		That girl was vile to you.

		Interesting postscript to that

				RANDAL
		Your mother.

				DANTE
		Allan Harris.

				RANDAL
		Chess team Allan Harris?!

				DANTE
		The two moved to Idaho together
		after graduation. They raise sheep.

				RANDAL
		That's frightening.

				DANTE
		It takes different strokes to move
		the world.

				RANDAL
		In light of this lurid tale, I
		don't see how you could even
		romanticize your relationship with
		Caitlin-she broke your heart and
		inadvertently drove men to deviant
		lifestyles.

				DANTE
		Because there was a lot of good in
		our relationship.

				RANDAL
		Oh yeah.

				DANTE
		I'm serious. Aside from the
		cheating, we were a great couple.
		That's what high school's all
		about-algebra, bad lunch, and
		infidelity.

				RANDAL
		You think things would be any
		different now?

									37.


				DANTE
		They are. When she calls me now,
		she's a different person-she's
		frightened and vulnerable. She's
		about to finish college and enter
		the real world. That's got to be
		scary for anyone.

				RANDAL
			(suddenly recalling)
		Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

				DANTE
		I'm talking to myself here.

				RANDAL
		No, no, I'm listening. She's
		leaving college, and...?

				DANTE
		...and she's looking to me for
		support. And I think that this is
		leading our relationship to a new
		level.

				RANDAL
		What about Veronica?

				DANTE
		I think the arguments Veronica and
		I are having are some kind of
		manifestation of a subconscious
		desire to break away from her so
		that I can pursue the possibility
		of a more meaningful relationship
		with Caitlin.

				RANDAL
		Caitlin's on the same wave-length?

				DANTE
		I think it's safe to say yes.

				RANDAL
		Then I think all four of you had
		better sit down and talk it over.

				RANDAL
		Blasphemy.

				DANTE
		Empire had the better ending: Luke
		gets his hand cut off, and finds
		out Vader's his father; Han gets
		frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.
		It ends on such a down note. And
		that's life-a series of down

				RANDAL
		There was something else going on

	RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store.

				DANTE
		What's that?

				RANDAL
		All right, Vader's boss...

				DANTE
		The Emperor.

				RANDAL
		Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor
		is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?

				DANTE
		How do you mean?

				RANDAL
		Well, he's like the pope for the
		dark side of the Force. He's a holy
		man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an
		evil one.

									47.


				DANTE
		I guess.

				RANDAL
		Now, he's in charge of the Empire.
		The Imperial government is under
		his control. And the entire galaxy
		is under Imperial rule.

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				RANDAL
		Then wouldn't that logically mean
		that it's a theocracy? If the head
		of the Empire is a priest of some
		sort, then it stands to reason that
		the government is therefore one
		based on religion.

				DANTE
		It would stand to reason, yes.

				RANDAL
		Hence, the Empire was a fascist
		theocracy, and the rebel forces
		were therefore battling religious
		persecution.

				DANTE
		More or less.

				RANDAL
		The only problem is that at no
		point in the series did I ever hear
		Leia or any of the rebels declare a

				DANTE
		There's more?

				RANDAL
		So they build another Death Star,
		right?

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				RANDAL
		Now the first one they built was
		completed and fully operational
		before the Rebels destroyed it.

				DANTE
		Luke blew it up. Give credit where
		it's due.

				RANDAL
		And the second one was still being
		built when they blew it up.

				DANTE
		Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

				RANDAL
		Something just never sat right with
		me the second time they destroyed
		it. I could never put my finger on
		it-something just wasn't right.

				DANTE
		And you figured it out?

				RANDAL
		Well, the thing is, the first Death
		Star was manned by the Imperial
		army-storm troopers, dignitaries-
		the only people onboard were
		Imperials.

				DANTE
		Basically.

				RANDAL
		So when they blew it up, no prob.
		Evil is punished.

				DANTE
		And the second time around...?

									49.


				RANDAL
		The second time around, it wasn't
		even finished yet. They were still
		under construction.

				DANTE
		So?

				RANDAL
		A construction job of that magnitude
		would require a helluva lot more
		manpower than the Imperial army had
		to offer. I'll bet there were
		independent contractors working on
		that thing: plumbers, aluminum
		siders, roofers.

				DANTE
		Not just Imperials, is what you're
		getting at.

				RANDAL
		Exactly. In order to get it built
		quickly and quietly they'd hire
		anybody who could do the job. Do
		you think the average storm trooper
		knows how to install a toilet main?
		All they know is killing and white
		uniforms.

				DANTE
		All right, so even if independent
		contractors are working on the
		Death Star, why are you uneasy with
		its destruction?

				RANDAL
		All those innocent contractors
		hired to do a job were killed-
		casualties of a war they had
		nothing to do with.
			(notices Dante's confusion)
		All right, look-you're a roofer,

				RANDAL (CONT'D)
		You didn't ask for that. You have
		no personal politics. You're just
		trying to scrape out a living.

	The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Excuse me. I don't mean to
		interrupt, but what were you
		talking about?

				RANDAL
		The ending of Return of the Jedi.

				DANTE
		My friend is trying to convince me
		that any contractors working on the
		uncompleted Death Star were innocent
		victims when the space station was
		destroyed by the rebels.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm
		a roofer...
			(digs into pocket and
			produces business card)
		Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements.
		And speaking as a roofer, I can say
		that a roofer's personal politics
		come heavily into play when choosing
		jobs.

				RANDAL
		Like when?

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Three months ago I was offered a
		job up in the hills. A beautiful
		house with tons of property. It was
		a simple reshingling job, but I was
		told that if it was finished within
		a day, my price would be doubled.
		Then I realized whose house it was.

				DANTE
		Whose house was it?

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Dominick Bambino's.

				RANDAL
		"Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?

									51.


				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		The same. The money was right, but
		the risk was too big. I knew who he
		was, and based on that, I passed
		the job on to a friend of mine.

				DANTE
		Based on personal politics.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Right. And that week, the Foresci
		family put a hit on Babyface's
		house. My friend was shot and
		killed. He wasn't even finished
		shingling.

				RANDAL
		No way!

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
			(paying for coffee)
		I'm alive because I knew there were
		risks involved taking on that
		particular client. My friend wasn't
		so lucky.
			(pauses to reflect)
		You know, any contractor willing to
		work on that Death Star knew the
		risks. If they were killed, it was
		their own fault. A roofer listens
		to this...
			(taps his heart)
		not his wallet.

	The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain
	respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the
	door and pokes her head in.

				WOMAN
		Is that video store open or not?

						CUT TO:

	INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

	RANDAL reads a newspaper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER studies the
	two rental choices she holds. She looks from one movie to
	the other repeatedly.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(attempting a solicit help)
		They say so much, but they never
		tell you if it's any good.

									52.


	RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The
	INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was
	even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different
	approach.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		Are either of these any good?

	RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries
	harder, then louder and more direct:

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		Sir!

	RANDAL continues to read.

				RANDAL
			(flatly)
		What.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(politely)
		Are either of these any good?

	RANDAL, as always, reads on.

				RANDAL
			(again, flatly)
		I don't watch movies.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put
	off.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		Well, have you heard anything about
		either of them?

	RANDAL does his level best to not get involved.

				RANDAL
			(reading)
		No.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(in disbelief)
		You've never heard anybody say
		anything about either movie?

									53.


				RANDAL (O.C.)
		I find it's best to stay out of
		other people's affairs.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(with a new determination)
		Well, how about these two movies?
			(holds up the same two)


	RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up.

				RANDAL
		They suck.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his
	paper. She has caught him.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		I just held up the same two movies.
		You're not even paying attention.

				RANDAL
		No, I wasn't.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		I don't think your manager would
		appreciate...

				RANDAL
			(turning the page)
		I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		I beg your pardon!

				RANDAL
			(reading on)
		Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to
		trick me.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(defending herself)
		I only pointed out that you weren't
		paying any attention to what I was
		saying.

				RANDAL
			(turning page and reading)
		I hope it feels good.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		You hope what feels good?

									54.


				RANDAL
		I hope it feels so good to be right.
		There is nothing more exhilarating
		than pointing out the shortcomings
		of others, is there?

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter
	disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video
	clerk. The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total
	disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL. The INDECISIVE
	CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies
	back onto the wall.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(in a huff)
		Well this is the last time I ever
		rent here...

				RANDAL
		You'll be missed.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(losing it altogether)
		Screw you!

	She storms out. RANDAL is offended. He hops over the counter
	and whips the door open.

				RANDAL
			(calling after her)
		You're not allowed to rent here
		anymore!

	RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily,
	totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.

				RANDAL
		Screw me!

	He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys.
	Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside,
	gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the
	opposite direction from the woman.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	DANTE is staring, open-mouthed, at something O.C. RANDAL
	hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade.

				RANDAL
		You'll never believe what this
		unruly customer just said...

									55.


				DANTE
			(a hand up to urge
			him to hush)
		Wait.

				RANDAL
			(looking around)
		She's in here?

				DANTE
		This guy is going through all of
		the eggs. Look.

	An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs,
	all opened. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it
	open, and examines each egg carefully.

				DANTE (O.C.)
		This has been going on for twenty
		minutes.

	RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity.

				RANDAL
		What's he looking for?

				DANTE
		He said he has to find a perfect
		dozen.

				RANDAL
		Perfect dozen.

				DANTE
		Each egg has to be perfect.

				RANDAL
		The quest isn't going well?

				DANTE
		Obviously not. Look at all the
		cartons that didn't make the grade.

	The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from
	several different angles.

				RANDAL (O.C.)
		Why doesn't he just mix and match?

				DANTE
		I told him that and he yelled at me.

	RANDAL snickers at his friend.

									56.


				RANDAL
		What did he say?

				DANTE
		He said it was important to have
		standards. He said nobody has pride
		anymore.

				RANDAL
		It's not like you laid the eggs
		yourself.

				DANTE
		I'll give him five more minutes
		then I'm calling the cops. I don't
		need this, man. I'm not even
		supposed to be here today.

	A SMOKER steps in.

				SMOKER
		Two packs of cigarettes.

	Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and
	searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at RANDAL and
	then at the O.C. oddity.

	The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor. The SMOKER
	looks at RANDAL.

				RANDAL
			(still staring at the
			ODD MAN)
		I'm as puzzled as you.

				SMOKER
			(paying DANTE)
		I've actually seen it before.

				DANTE
		You know him?

				SMOKER
		No, I've seen that behavior before.
		Looking for the perfect carton of
		eggs, right?

				RANDAL
			(a bit astonished)
		Yeah. How'd you know?

				SMOKER
		I'll bet you a million bucks that
		the guy's a guidance counselor.

									57.


				DANTE
		Why do you say that?

				SMOKER
		I was in the Food City last year
		when the same thing happened,
		different guy though. Stock boy
		told me that the guy had been
		looking through the eggs for like
		half an hour, doing all sorts of
		endurance tests and shit. I ask the
		kid how come nobody called the
		manager, and he says it happens
		twice a week, sometimes more.

				RANDAL
		Get out of here.

				SMOKER
		I kid you not. They call it Shell
		Shock. Only happens with guidance
		counselors for some reason. The kid
		said they used to make a big deal
		about it, but there's no point.

	The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor.
	He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg
	still sitting on the floor.

				SMOKER (O.C.)
		He said they always pay for whatever
		they break and they never bother
		anybody.

	DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man.

				DANTE
		Why guidance counselors?

				SMOKER
		If your job served as little
		purpose as theirs, wouldn't you
		lose it, too?

				RANDAL
		Come to think of it, my guidance
		counselor was kind of worthless.

				SMOKER
			(grabbing matches)
		See? It's important to have a job
		that makes a difference, boys.
		That's why I kill Chinamen for the

				RANDAL
		The jizz-mopper's job is to clean

		Well, I don't know if sorry can

	The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something.

		Well, you think that's offensive...

	RANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic

	wide open.

		Can we not talk about this?

				SANFORD
		Fine by me. But you're living in
		denial and suppressing rage.
			(skating away; to all)
		Dante said we can all drink free
		Gatorade.

	A laid-back hurrah is heard.

				RANDAL
		Are you gonna lock the store?

				DANTE
		I don't know. You going to lock the
		video store?

				RANDAL
		Look who you're asking here. How're
		we gonna block off the street?

				DANTE
		We're not playing in the street.

				RANDAL
		Then where're we gonna play?

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	The sign on the door reads:

	TEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD.

	The PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one.
	ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More
	players join them.

									72.


	From across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a
	store with many men gliding around on the roof.

	On the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player.
	REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls
	his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD
	skates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and
	SILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge
	and JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the
	center of the court.

				DANTE
		Ready?

	PLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and
	holds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off,
	and the ball is in play.

	The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet.
	Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots
	are taken, CU's of various players included.

	INACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the
	sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting
	scored on and more face-offs.

	Below, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He
	reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting
	to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues.

	Below, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other
	impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

	Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of
	the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and
	he watches for a moment before calling out.

				CUSTOMER
		When's this period over?

				SOMEONE (O.C.)
		Eight more minutes!

				CUSTOMER
		Are you shitting me? I want to get
		cigarettes!

	DANTE skids to the sidelines.

				DANTE
			(out of breath)
		If you can just wait a few more
		minutes.

									73.


				CUSTOMER
		Fuck that! I'm gonna break my crazy
		neck on this ladder!

				SOMEONE (O.C.)
		Dante! Where are you?!

				CUSTOMER
		He's busy!

	DANTE starts to skate away.

				DANTE
		I'll be right back. It's almost over.

	He jumps back into the game.

				CUSTOMER
		What the fuck is this?! I want some
		service!

				DANTE (O.C.)
		In a second!

				CUSTOMER
		Fuck in a second! This is...Look at
		you! You can't even pass!

				DANTE (O.C.)
		I can pass!

				CUSTOMER
		How 'bout covering point!? You suck!

	DANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER.

				DANTE
		Who are you to make assessments?

				CUSTOMER
		I'll assess all I want!

				SOMEONE (O.C.)
		DANTE! ARE YOU IN OR OUT!

				CUSTOMER
			(to O.C. SOMEONE)
		Don't pass to this guy! He sucks!
			(to DANTE)
		You suck!

				DANTE
		Like you're better!

									74.


				CUSTOMER
		I can whip your ass.

	Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store,
	face against the glass.

				DANTE (O.C.)
		That's easy to say from over here.

				CUSTOMER (O.C.)
		Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll
		knock your fucking teeth out and
		pass all over your ass.

	The WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the
	roof.

				WOMAN
		Is the convenience store open?

	Above, DANTE and the CUSTOMER shout down at the O.C. WOMAN.

				DANTE AND CUSTOMER
			(simultaneously)
		NO!

				DANTE
			(to CUSTOMER)
		There's a stick over there. You're
		shooting against the goal.
			(to the court)
		REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK
		ON!

	A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball
	drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER
	winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the
	court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls
	to the sidelines.

				DANTE
		Give me another ball.

				SOMEONE (O.C.)
		There are no more.

				DANTE
		What the fuck are you talking about?
		How many balls did you bring?

	SANFORD skates up to him.

									75.


				SANFORD
			(counting)
		There was the orange ball...and the
		orange ball.

	DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over.

				DANTE
		Are there any balls down there?!

				JAY (O.C.)
		'Bout the biggest pair you ever
		seen! NYNNE!!

	DANTE looks around, hyperventilating.

				DANTE
		You only brought one ball?!

				SANFORD
		I thought Redding had like three
		balls!

				REDDING (O.C.)
		I thought Dante had the balls.

				DANTE
		Nobody has another ball?

				SANFORD
		Shit!

				DANTE
		We get...what...twelve minutes of
		game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck!
		Fuck! Fuck!!
			(pause; rubs head)
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

	DANTE skates off.

				SANFORD
		We still get free Gatorade, right?

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	DANTE standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light. An
	OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder.

				OLD MAN
		Be careful.

									76.


				DANTE
		I'm trying.

				OLD MAN
		You know the insides of those are
		filled with stuff that gives you
		cancer.

				DANTE
		So I'm told.

				OLD MAN
		I had a friend that used to chew
		glass for a living. In the circus.

	The light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it.

				DANTE
		And he got cancer by chewing
		fluorescent bulb glass...?

				OLD MAN
		No, he got hit by a bus.

				DANTE
			(confused)
		Oh...Can I help you?

				OLD MAN
		Well, that depends. Do you have a
		bathroom?

				DANTE
		Um...yeah, but it's for employees
		only.

				OLD MAN
		I understand, but can I use it. I'm
		not that young anymore, so I'm kind
		of...you know...incontinent.

				DANTE
		Uh...sure. Go ahead. It's back
		through the cooler.

				OLD MAN
		Thanks son. Say-what kind of toilet
		paper you got back there?

				DANTE
		The white kind.

									77.


				OLD MAN
		I'm not asking about the color. I
		mean is it rough or cottony?

				DANTE
		Actually, it is kind of rough.

				OLD MAN
		Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell
		out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would
		you mind if I took a roll of the
		soft stuff back there. I see you
		sell the soft stuff.

				DANTE
		Yeah, but...

				OLD MAN
		Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference?
		You said yourself the stuff that's
		there now is rough.

				DANTE
		Yeah, okay. Go ahead.

				OLD MAN
		Thanks son, you're a lifesaver.

	The OLD MAN walks off. DANTE heads back to the counter. The
	OLD MAN returns.

				OLD MAN
		Say, young fella, you know I hate
		to bother you again, but can I take
		a paper or something back there...to
		read? It usually takes me a while,
		and I like to read while it's going
		on.

				DANTE
		Jesus...go ahead.

				OLD MAN
		Thanks, young man. You've got a
		heart of gold.

	The OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines.
	He comes back to the counter.

				DANTE
		You know, you probably could've
		been home, already, in the time
		it's taken you to get in there.

									78.


				OLD MAN
		Can I trouble you for one of those
		magazines?

				DANTE
		I said go ahead.

				OLD MAN
		No, I mean the ones there. Behind
		the counter.

	DANTE glances over and reacts.

				DANTE
		The porno mags?

				OLD MAN
		Yeah. I like the cartoons. They
		make me laugh. They draw the
		biggest titties.

				DANTE
			(hands one to him)
		Here. Now leave me alone.

				OLD MAN
		Uh, can I have the other one. The
		one below this one. They show more
		in that one.

	DANTE makes the switch.

				OLD MAN
		Thanks son. I appreciate this.

	The OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close,
	then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE.

				RANDAL
		Helluva game!

				DANTE
		One ball!! They come all the way
		here...I close the damn store...for
		one ball!

				RANDAL
		Hockey's hockey. At least we got to
		play.

				DANTE
		Randal, twelve minutes is not a
		game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up!

									79.


				RANDAL
		Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want
		something to drink?
			(walking away)


				DANTE
		Gatorade.

	Pause. Then...

				RANDAL (O.C.)
		What happened to all the Gatorade?

				DANTE
		Exactly. They drank it all.

				RANDAL (O.C.)
		After an exhausting game like that
		I can believe it.

				DANTE
			(as RANDAL)
		"It's not like we're gonna sell
		out."

	RANDAL comes back with drinks.

				RANDAL
		You know what Sanford told me?
			(offering drink)


				DANTE
		I still can't believe Caitlin's
		getting married.

				RANDAL
		Julie Dwyer died.

				DANTE
		Yeah, right.

				RANDAL
		No, I'm serious.

	DANTE is visibly taken aback.

				DANTE
		Oh, my god.

				RANDAL
		Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
		He found out this morning.

									80.


				DANTE
		How? When?

				RANDAL
		Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

				DANTE
		Jesus.

				RANDAL
		She was swimming at the YMCA pool
		when it happened. Died midbackstroke.

				DANTE
		I haven't seen her in almost two
		years.

				RANDAL
		Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't
		she one of the illustrious twelve?

				DANTE
		Number six.

				RANDAL
		You've had sex with a dead person.

				DANTE
		I'm gonna go to her wake.

				RANDAL
		No, you're not.

				DANTE
		Why not?

				RANDAL
		It's today.

				DANTE
		What!?

				RANDAL
		Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next
		show is at four.

				DANTE
		Shit. What about tomorrow?

				RANDAL
		One night only. She's buried in the
		morning.

									81.


				DANTE
		You've gotta watch the store. I
		have to go to this.

				RANDAL
		Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred
		to you that I might bereaved as well?

				DANTE
		You hardly knew her!

				RANDAL
		True, but do you know how many
		people are going to be there? All
		of our old classmates, to say the
		least.

				DANTE
		Stop it. This is beneath even you.

				RANDAL
		I'm not missing what's probably
		going to be the social event of the
		season.

				DANTE
		You hate people.

				RANDAL
		But I love gatherings. Isn't it
		ironic?

				DANTE
		Don't be an asshole. Somebody has
		to stay with the store.

				RANDAL
		If you go, I go.

				DANTE
		She meant nothing to you!

				RANDAL
		She meant nothing to you either
		until I told you she died.

				DANTE
		I'm not taking you to this funeral.

				RANDAL
		I'm going with you.

				DANTE
		I can't close the store.

									82.


				RANDAL
		You just closed the store to play
		hockey on the roof!

				DANTE
		Exactly, which means I can't close
		it for another hour so we can both
		go to a wake.

						CUT TO:

	INT CAR: DAY

	DANTE drives with passenger RANDAL, their backs to the camera.

				RANDAL
		You were saying?

				DANTE
		Thanks for putting me in a tough
		spot. You're a good friend.

	Silence. Then...

				RANDAL
		She was pretty young, hunhh?

				DANTE
		Twenty-two; same as us.

				RANDAL
		An embolism in a pool.

				DANTE
		An embarrassing way to die.

				RANDAL
		That's nothing compared to how my
		cousin Walter died.

				DANTE
		How'd he die?

				RANDAL
		Broke his neck.

				DANTE
		That's embarrassing?

				RANDAL
		He broke his neck trying to suck
		his own dick.

	Absolute silence. Then...

									83.


				DANTE
		Shut the hell up.

				RANDAL
		Bible truth.

				DANTE
		Stop it.

				RANDAL
		I swear.

				DANTE
		Oh, my god.

				RANDAL
		Come on. Haven't you ever tried to
		suck your own dick?

				DANTE
		No!

				RANDAL
		Yeah sure. You're so repressed.

				DANTE
		Because I never tried to suck my
		own dick?

				RANDAL
		No, because you won't admit to it.
		As if a guy's a fucking pervert
		because he tries to go down on
		himself. You're as curious as the
		rest of us, pal. You've tried it.

				DANTE
		Who found him?

				RANDAL
		My cousin? My aunt found him. On
		his bed, doubled over himself with
		his legs on top. Dick in his mouth.
		My aunt freaked out. It was a mess.

				DANTE
		His dick was in his mouth?

				RANDAL
		Balls resting on his lips.

				DANTE
		He made it, hunhh?

									84.


				RANDAL
		Yeah, but at what a price.

	Silence. Then...

				DANTE
		I could never reach.

				RANDAL
		Reach what?

				DANTE
		You know.

				RANDAL
		What, your dick?

				DANTE
		Yeah. Like you said, you know. I
		guess everyone tries it, sooner of
		later.

				RANDAL
		I never tried it.

	DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then...

				RANDAL
		Fucking pervert.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

	DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor.

				DANTE
		I know it was a bad idea to close
		the store.

				RANDAL
		Listen to you.

				DANTE
		I can't help it. At least when we
		were playing hockey outside, I
		could see if anyone wanted to go in.

				RANDAL
		Nobody's there. It's four o'clock
		on a Saturday. How many people ever
		come to the store at four on a
		Saturday?

						CUT TO:

									85.


	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

	DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by
	a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down.
	The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the
	middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

	The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely
	nobody is outside.

				DANTE
			(furious)
		I can't fucking believe you!!

				RANDAL
		I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!

				DANTE
		You knocked the fucking casket
		over, for Chrissakes!

				RANDAL
		I was just leaning on it! It was an
		accident!

				DANTE
		Does anyone ever knock over a
		casket on purpose?

				RANDAL
		So the casket fell over! Big deal!

				DANTE
		Her fucking body fell out!

				RANDAL
		So they'll put her back in! It's
		not like it's gonna matter if she
		breaks something!

				DANTE
			(opening door)
		Just...go! Go open the video store.

									86.


				JAY (O.C.)
			(mimicking)
		Yeah! Open the video store!!

				RANDAL
			(to O.C.)
		Shut the fuck up, junkie!

	JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt
	at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL.

				DANTE
			(to RANDAL)
		Go open the video store.

				JAY
		Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

				DANTE
			(to JAY)
		How many times I gotta tell you not
		to deal outside the store.

				JAY
		I'm not dealing.

	A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt.

				KID
		You got anything, man?

				JAY
		Yeah, what do you want?

	RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience
	store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the
	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears,
	flashlight in hand, scanning the ground.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
			(to JAY)
		Hey, did you see a set of keys
		lying around here somewhere?

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

	DANTE rearranges the milk. RANDAL joins him.

				RANDAL
		Let me borrow your car.

									87.


				DANTE
		I don't want to talk to you.

				RANDAL
		Fine. Just lend me your car.

				DANTE
		Why should I loan you my car?

				RANDAL
		I want to rent a movie.

				DANTE
			(pause)
		You want to rent a movie.

	DANTE walks away, shaking his head.

				RANDAL
		What's that for?

				DANTE
		You work in a video store!

	They head back to the counter.

				RANDAL
		I work in a shitty video store. I
		want to go to a good video store so
		I can rent a good movie.

				CUSTOMER
		Are you open?

				DANTE AND RANDAL
			(simultaneously)
		YES!

	The CUSTOMER comes to the counter.

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.
			(pets cat)
		Cute cat. What's its name?

				RANDAL
		Annoying Customer.

	The CUSTOMER lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff.
	DANTE puts up cigarettes.

									88.


				DANTE
		Can you imagine being halfway
		decent to the customers at least
		some of the time?

				RANDAL
		Let me borrow your car.

				DANTE
			(calmer)
		May I be blunt with you?

				RANDAL
		If you must.

				DANTE
		We are employees of Quick Stop
		Convenience and RST video,
		respectively. As such, we have
		certain responsibilities which-
		though it may seem cruel and
		unusual-does include manning our
		posts until closing.

				RANDAL
		I see. So playing hockey and
		attending wakes-these practices are
		standard operating procedure.

				DANTE
		There's a difference. Those were
		obligations. Obligations that could
		not have been met at any later date.
		Now renting videos-that's just
		gratuitous, not to mention
		illogical, considering you work in
		a video store.

	Another CUSTOMER leans in.

				CUSTOMER
		Are you open?

				DANTE
			(rolls his eyes)
		Yes.

				RANDAL
		You know what? I don't think I care
		for you rationale.

									89.


				DANTE
		It's going to have to do for now,
		considering that it's my car that's
		up for request.
			(to CUSTOMER)
		Can I help you?

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.

				RANDAL
		What's your point?

				DANTE
		My point is that you're a clerk,
		paid to do a job. You can't just do
		anything you want while you're
		working.

				CUSTOMER
			(reading tabloid)
		"Space Alien Revealed as Head of
		Time Warner; Reports Stock
		Increase."
			(to DANTE and RANDAL)
		They print any kind of shit in
		these papers.

				DANTE
		They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

				RANDAL
		So your argument is that title
		dictates behavior?

				DANTE
		What?

				RANDAL
		The reasons you won't let me borrow
		your care is because I have a title
		and a job description, and I'm
		supposed to follow it, right?

				DANTE
		Exactly.

				CUSTOMER
			(interjecting)
		I saw one, one time, that said the
		world was ending the next week.
				(MORE)

									90.


				CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
		Then in the next week's paper, they
		said we were miraculously saved at
		the zero hour by a Koala-fish
		mutant bird. Crazy shit.

				RANDAL
			(eyes the CUSTOMER, annoyed)
		So I'm no more responsible for my
		own decisions while I'm here at
		work than, say, the Death Squad
		soldiers in Bosnia?

				DANTE
		That's stretching it. You're not
		being asked to slay children or
		anything.

				RANDAL
		Not yet.
			(sips water)


				CUSTOMER
			(again with the interjections)
		And I remember this one time the
		damn paper said...

	RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.
	The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from
	over the counter. RANDAL makes no move, but remains untouched.
	DANTE plays block.

				CUSTOMER
		I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
		YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!

				DANTE
		Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean
		it! He was trying to get me.

				CUSTOMER
		Well, he missed!

				DANTE
		I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund
		your cigarette money, and we'll
		call it even.

									91.


				CUSTOMER
			(considerably calmer;
			takes money)
		This is the last time I ever come
		here.
			(to RANDAL)
		And if I ever see you again, I'm
		gonna break your fucking head open!

	The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL
	salutes him.

				DANTE
			(angrily)
		What the fuck did you do that for?

				RANDAL
		Two reasons: one, I hate when the
		people can't shut up about the
		stupid tabloid headlines.

				DANTE
		Jesus!

				RANDAL
		And two, to make a point: title
		does not dictate behavior.

				DANTE
		What?

				RANDAL
		If title dictated my behavior, as a
		clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
		be allowed to spit a mouthful of
		water at that guy. But I did, so my
		point is that people dictate their
		own behavior. Hence, even though
		I'm a clerk in this video store, I
		choose to go rent videos at Big
		Choice.
			(extends opened palm)
		Agreed?

				DANTE
			(shakes his head;
			hands over keys)
		You're a danger to both the dead
		and the living.

				RANDAL
		I like to think I'm a master of my
		own destiny.

									92.


				DANTE
		Please, get the hell out of here.

				RANDAL
		I know I'm your hero.

	RANDAL exits.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of
	milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt.

				TRAINER
		Sounds to me like somebody needs to
		hit the gym.

				DANTE
		Excuse me?

				TRAINER
		I heard you strain when you put the
		milk in the bag. That milk only
		weighs about seven pounds.

				DANTE
		I didn't strain. I sighed.

				TRAINER
		I don't think so. That was a grunt;
		a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
		in the stretching of muscles. I'm a
		trainer. I know what that sound
		signifies: you're out of shape.

				DANTE
		I don't think so.

				TRAINER
		Oh, I do. You made the same noise
		when you reached across the counter
		for my cash. Your muscles are thin
		and sadly underutilized.

				DANTE
		They are not.

				TRAINER
		Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

									93.


				DANTE
		What are you talking about? There's
		no fat on this body.

				TRAINER
		No fat, but no tone either. You
		don't get enough exercise.

	A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway.

				HEATHER
		Are you open?

				DANTE
		Yes.

				HEATHER
			(grabs a paper)
		Just the paper.

				DANTE
			(to HEATHER)
		Thirty-fire.

				TRAINER
			(to HEATHER)
		Let me ask you a question: Do you
		think this guy's out of shape?

				HEATHER
			(studies DANTE)
		I don't know. I can't really tell
		from here.

				TRAINER
		He is.

				DANTE
		I am not.

				TRAINER
		How much can you bench?

				DANTE
		I don't know.

				HEATHER
			(studying DANTE)
		I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.

				DANTE
		I know I can bench more than that!

									94.


				TRAINER
		I think the lady called it.

				HEATHER
		My ex-boyfriend was about his
		height, but he was much bulkier. He
		could bench two-fifty, three
		hundred easy.

				TRAINER
		I do about three-fifty, four.

				HEATHER
		No way!

				TRAINER
			(rolling up sleeve)
		Feel that.

				HEATHER
		That's tight. Solid.

				TRAINER
		Now feel his.
			(to DANTE)
		Roll up your sleeve, chief.

				DANTE
		Oh for God's sake!

				TRAINER
		See? You're ashamed. You know
		you're out of shape. Take my card.
		I can help you tone that body up in
		no time. Get you on an aerobics and
		free-weights program.

	A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter.

				SUITED MAN
		You open?

				DANTE
			(to MAN)
		Yes.
			(to TRAINER)
		I'm not out of shape.

				SUITED MAN
		Excuse me, but have you been here

			(still studying DANTE)
		He's got those love handles.

				DANTE
			(to HEATHER)
		I don't have love handles.

				SUITED MAN
		Were you working here at about four
		o'clock?

				DANTE
		I've been here since six o'clock
		this morning. Why?

				TRAINER
			(to HEATHER)
		It's probably from being around all
		this food every day.

				HEATHER
		Oh, I know. If I had to work here
		all day, I'd be bloated and out of
		shape, too.

				DANTE
		I'm not out of shape!

				SUITED MAN
		Can I have your name please?

				DANTE
		Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?

	The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook.

				HEATHER
		You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I
		didn't even recognize you!

				TRAINER
		Because he's out of shape.

				DANTE
		Do I know you?

				HEATHER
		You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung
		out with...

				DANTE
		Caitlin Bree. Yeah?

									96.


				HEATHER
		I'm her sister.

				DANTE
		You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?

				HEATHER
		Yep. I remember you got caught in
		my parents' room with Caitlin once.

				TRAINER
		Did you say Caitlin Bree?

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				TRAINER
		Pretty girl, about this girl's
		height-dark hair-gorgeous body?

				DANTE
		Yeah?

				TRAINER
		And your name is Dante Hicks? You
		went to high school with her? You
		played hockey?

				DANTE
		How do you know that?

				TRAINER
		Oh man! Hey, you still going out
		with her?

				DANTE
		No, she's getting married.

				TRAINER
		To you?

				HEATHER
		To an Asian design major.

				TRAINER
		Shit!
			(to DANTE)
		Don't take this the wrong way, but
		I used to fuck her.

				DANTE
		What?

									97.


				TRAINER
		While you two were dating in high
		school. We're talking four, five
		years ago, back when I drove a
		Trans-Am.

				HEATHER
		Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?

				TRAINER
		Yeah!

				DANTE
		You know him?

				HEATHER
		Caitlin used to talk about him all
		the time.

				TRAINER
		Really?

				HEATHER
		Oh yeah. You were the built older
		guy with the black Trans and the
		big...

				DANTE
		Wait a second!
			(to TRAINER)
		You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree?
		While I was dating her?

				TRAINER
		All the time. That girl was like a
		rabbit.

				DANTE
		I...I don't believe this...

				HEATHER
			(to TRAINER)
		I still remember Caitlin telling us
		about that time you two went to
		that motel-the one with the mirrors
		and the hot tub in the room.

				DANTE
		THE GLADES MOTEL?

									98.


				TRAINER
		Holy shit! She told you about that!
			(to DANTE)
		Buddy of mine worked there. Said he
		watched the whole thing. They used
		to film people at that hotel;
		nobody knew about it.

				HEATHER
		She said one time you set up a tent
		on the beach and you guys did it in
		the middle of this big rainstorm.

				DANTE
		What? When? When did all this shit
		happen?

				TRAINER
		Hey man, that was a long time ago.
		Don't let it get to you.

				HEATHER
		I'm surprised you never found out
		about it, Dante. Everybody in
		school knew-even in my class.

				DANTE
		Jesus Christ, what next?

	The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and
	hands it to DANTE.

				SUITED MAN
		Here you go.

				DANTE
		What's this?

				SUITED MAN
		A fine, for five hundred dollars.

				DANTE
		WHAT?

				TRAINER
		Five hundred bucks? What for?

				SUITED MAN
		For violation of New Jersey Statute
		Section Two A, number one-seventy
		slash fifty-one: Any person who
		sells or makes available tobacco or
		tobacco-related products to persons
		under the age of eighteen is
		regarded as disorderly.

									99.


				DANTE
		What are you talking about?

				SUITED MAN
		According to the NJAC-the New
		Jersey Administrative Code, section
		eighteen, five, slash twelve point
		five-a fine of no less than two
		hundred and fifty dollars is to be
		leveled against any person reported
		selling cigarettes to a minor.

				DANTE
		I didn't do that!

				SUITED MAN
		You said you were here all day?

				DANTE
		Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes
		to any kids!

				SUITED MAN
		An angry mother called the state
		division of taxation and complained
		that the man working at Quick Stop
		Convenience sold her five-year-old
		daughter cigarettes today at around
		four o'clock. Division of taxation
		calls the State Board of Health,
		and they send me down here to issue
		a fine. You say you were working
		all day, hence the fine is yours.
		It's doubled due to the incredibly
		young age of the child.

				DANTE
		But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kid!

				TRAINER
		To a five-year-old kid? What a
		scumbag!

				HEATHER
		That's sick, Dante.

				DANTE
		I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kids! I swear!

									100.


				SUITED MAN
		The due date is on the bottom. This
		summons cannot be contested in any
		court of law. Failure to remit
		before the due date will result in
		a charge of criminal negligence,
		and a warrant will be issued for
		your arrest. Have a nice day.

	The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow.

				DANTE
		But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kids! Hey!

				TRAINER
			(takes back the card)
		Forget it. I don't want to deal
		with a guy that sells cigarettes to
		a five-year-old.
			(to HEATHER)
		Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

				HEATHER
		Sure. How about the beach?

				TRAINER
		I like the way you think.

	The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his
	forehead.

				DANTE
		Jesus! What next?

				VOICE (O.C.)
		Dante?

	DANTE spins, angrily.

				DANTE
		What?

	His expression softens.

				DANTE
		Caitlin?

		Just now.

				DANTE
		My God. I haven't seen you since...

				CAITLIN
		Dante. You've got a customer.

	DANTE hops behind the counter. A customer pays for something

				CAITLIN
		You saw it?

				DANTE
		Very dramatic, I thought.

				CAITLIN
		It's not what you think.

				DANTE
		What, it's worse? You're pregnant
		with an Asian design major's child?

				CAITLIN
		I'm not pregnant.

				DANTE
		Were you going to tell me or just
		send me an invitation?

				CAITLIN
		I was going to tell you. But then
		we were getting along so well, I
		didn't want to mess it up.

				DANTE
		You could've broke it to me gently,
		you know; at least started by
		telling me you had a boyfriend. I
		told you I have a girlfriend.

				CAITLIN
		I know, I'm sorry. But when we
		started talking...it's like I
		forgot I had a boyfriend. And then
		he proposed last month...

				DANTE
		And you said yes?

				CAITLIN
		Well...kind of, sort of?

				DANTE
		Is that what they teach you at that
		school of yours? Kind of, sort of?
		Everyone knows about this except me!
		Do you know how humiliating that is?

				CAITLIN
		I would've told you, and you would
		have stopped calling, like a baby.

									105.


				DANTE
		How do you know that?

				CAITLIN
		Because I know you. You prefer
		drastic measures to rational ones.

				DANTE
		So you're really getting married?

				CAITLIN
		No.

				DANTE
		No, you're not really getting
		married?

				CAITLIN
		The story goes like this: He
		proposed, and I told him I had to
		think about it, and he insisted I
		wear the ring anyway. Then my
		mother told the paper we were
		engaged.

				DANTE
		How like her.

				CAITLIN
		Then my mother called me this
		morning and told me the announcement
		was in the paper. That's when I
		hopped the train to come back here,
		because I knew you'd be a wreck.

				DANTE
		Thanks for the vote of confidence.

				CAITLIN
		Was I right?

				DANTE
		Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is
		more like it. Mildly disturbed even.

				CAITLIN
		I love a macho façade. It's such a
		turn-on.
			(sniffing air)
		What smells like shoe polish?

				DANTE
		And you came here to what? To
		comfort me?

									106.


				CAITLIN
		The last thing I needed was for you
		to think I was hiding something
		from you.

				DANTE
		But you were.

				CAITLIN
		No, I wasn't. Not really. I told
		you'd I'd been seeing other people.

				DANTE
		Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
		you're ready to walk down the
		aisle-I'd say that constitutes
		something more than just seeing
		somebody.

				CAITLIN
		I'm giving him his ring back.

				DANTE
		What?

				CAITLIN
		I don't want to marry him. I don't
		want to get married now. I'm on the
		verge of graduation. I want to go
		to grad school after this. And then
		I want to start a career. I don't
		want to be a wife first, and then
		have to worry about when I'' going
		to fit in all of the other stuff.
		I've come way too far and studied
		too hard to let my education go to
		waste as a housewife. And I know
		that's what I'd become. Sang's
		already signed with a major firm,
		and he's going to be pulling a huge
		salary, which would give me no
		reason to work, and he's so
		traditional anyway...

				DANTE
		Sang? His name is a past tense?

				CAITLIN
		Stop it. He's a nice guy.

				DANTE
		If he's so nice, why aren't you
		going to marry him?

									107.


				CAITLIN
		I just told you.

				DANTE
		There's more, isn't there?

				CAITLIN
		Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

				DANTE
		Tell me I don't have something to
		do with it.

				CAITLIN
		You don't have anything to do with
		it.

				DANTE
		You lie.

				CAITLIN
		Look how full of yourself you are.

				DANTE
		I just believe in giving credit
		where credit is due. And I believe
		that I'm the impetus behind your
		failure to wed.

				CAITLIN
		If I'm so nuts about you, then why
		am I having sex with an Asian
		design major?

				DANTE
		Jesus, you're caustic.

				CAITLIN
		I had to bring you down from that
		cloud you were floating on. When I
		say I don't want to get married, I
		mean just that. I don't want to
		marry anybody. Not for years.

				DANTE
		So who's asking? I don't want to
		marry you.

				CAITLIN
		Good. Stay in that frame of mind.

				DANTE
		Buy can we date?

									108.


				CAITLIN
		I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would
		like that.

				DANTE
		We could introduce them. They might
		hit it off.

				CAITLIN
		You're serious. You want to date
		again.

				DANTE
		I would like to be your boyfriend,
		yes.

				CAITLIN
		It's just the shock of seeing me
		after three years. Believe me,
		you'll get over it.

				DANTE
		Give me a bit more credit. I think
		it's time we got back together, you
		know. I'm more mature, you're more
		mature, you're finishing college,
		I'm already in the job market...

				CAITLIN
		You work in a market, all right.

				DANTE
		Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to
		go out again. After all the talking
		we've been doing.

				CAITLIN
		The key word here is talk, Dante. I
		think the idea, the conception of
		us dating is more idyllic than what
		actually happens when we date.

				DANTE
		So...what? So we should just make
		pretend over the phone that we're
		dating?

				CAITLIN
		I don't know. Maybe we should just
		see what happens.

				DANTE
		Let me take you out tonight.

									109.


				CAITLIN
		You mean, on a date?

				DANTE
		Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

				CAITLIN
		The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie
		Date. I think I've been on that one
		before.

				DANTE
		You have a better suggestion?

				CAITLIN
		How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on
		the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked
		Somewhere Kind of Private Date?

				DANTE
		I hear that's a rather popular date.

				CAITLIN
			(hits him)
		Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at
		you, succumbing to your wily
		charms, and you call me a slut, in
		so many words.

				DANTE
		What about Sing?

				CAITLIN
		Sang.

				DANTE
		Sang.

				CAITLIN
		He's not invited.

				DANTE
		He's your fiancé.

				CAITLIN
		I offer you my body and you offer
		me semantics? He's just a boyfriend,
		Dante, and in case you haven't
		gotten the drift of why I came all
		the way here from Ohio, I'm about
		to become single again.
				(MORE)

									110.


				CAITLIN (CONT'D)
		And yes-let me placate your ego-you
		are the inspiration for this bold
		and momentous decision, for which
		I'll probably be ostracized at both
		school and home. You ask me who I
		choose, I choose you.

				DANTE
		So what are you saying?

				CAITLIN
		You're such an asshole.

				DANTE
		I'm just kidding.

				CAITLIN
		I can already tell this isn't going
		to work.

				DANTE
		I'll ask Randal to close up for me-
		when he gets back.

				CAITLIN
		Where'd he go? I'd have thought
		he'd be at your side, like an
		obedient lapdog.

				DANTE
		He went to rent a movie, but he
		hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw
		it; I'll just lock the store up and
		leave him a note.

				CAITLIN
		You're too responsible. But no. I
		have to go home first. They don't
		even know I left school. And I
		should break the disengagement news
		to my mother, which is going to
		cause quite a row, considering she
		loves Sang.

				DANTE
		Who doesn't?

				CAITLIN
		Well, me I guess.
			(gathering herself to go)
		So, I shall take my leave of you,
		but I will return in a little
		while, at which time-yes-I would
		love to go for dinner and a movie
		with you.

		Hey, Caitlin's in the back. You
		might want to see if she's okay;
		she's been back there a long time.

				DANTE
		There's no lights back there.

				RANDAL
		I told her that. She said she
		didn't need any. Why don't you join
		her, man. Make a little bathroom
		bam-bam.

				DANTE
		I love your sexy talk. It's

				RANDAL
		Fuck you.

	The cooler down is heard opening. CAITLIN walks lazily down

		How'd you get here so fast?

				DANTE
		I left like an hour ago.

		Do you always talk weird after you

	RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused.

				RANDAL
		Maybe the Asian design major
		slipped her some opium?

				DANTE
		Could be.

				CAITLIN
			(hugging DANTE)
		Promise me it'll always be like that.

				DANTE
		Like what?

				CAITLIN
		When you just lie perfectly still
		and let me do everything.

				DANTE
		Um...okay.

				RANDAL
		Am I missing something here?

				CAITLIN
		I went back there, and Dante was
		already waiting for me.

				RANDAL
		He was?

				CAITLIN
		It was so cool. He didn't say a
		word. He was just...ready, you know?
		And we didn't kiss or talk or
		anything. He just sat there and let
		me do all the work.

				RANDAL
			(to DANTE)
		You dog! I didn't see you go back

	DANTE is bewildered.

				CAITLIN
		And the fact that there weren't any

		God! That was so great!

			(quietly)
		It wasn't me.

				CAITLIN
			(laughing it off)
		Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?

				DANTE
			(to RANDAL)
		Was it you?

				RANDAL
		I was here the whole time.

				CAITLIN

		You two better quit it.

		No.

				DANTE
		Was he alive when...Caitlin...

				CORONER
		No. I place the time of death at

				RANDAL
		Then how could she...you know...

				CORONER
		The body can maintain an erection
		after expiration. Sometimes for
		hours. Did he have the adult
		magazine when he came in?

				DANTE
		No. I gave it to him.

	RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief.

				DANTE
		Well he asked me for it!

				CORONER
			(continuing)
		I can't say for certain until we

				DANTE
		What about Caitlin?

				CORONER
		Shock trauma. She's going to need

				DANTE
		What responsibility?

				RANDAL
		All right, if you hate this job and
		the people, and the fact that you
		have to come in on your day off,
		then quit.

				DANTE
		As if it's that easy.

				RANDAL
		It is. You just up and quit. There
		are other jobs, and they pay better
		money. You're bound to be qualified
		for at least one of them. So what's
		stopping you?

				DANTE
		Leave me alone.

				RANDAL
		You're comfortable. This is a life
		of convenience for you, and any
		attempt to change it would shatter
		the pathetic microcosm you've
		fashioned for yourself.

				DANTE
		Oh, like your life's any better?

				RANDAL
		I'm satisfied with my situation for

		You, on the other hand, have been

				DANTE
		Thank you. Why don't you go back to

				RANDAL
		It's the same thing with Veronica.

									128.


				DANTE
		Leave her out of this.

				RANDAL
		You date Veronica because she's low

				DANTE
		You're wrong. Things happened

		ruined my chances with Caitlin.

				RANDAL
		What? The dead guy? She'll get over
		fucking the dead guy. Shit, my
		mom's been fucking a dead guy for
		thirty years; I call him Dad.

				DANTE
		Caitlin and I can't be together.
		It's impossible.

		Melodrama coming from you seems

		What do you want me to say? Yes, I
		suppose some of the things you're
		saying may be true. But that's the
		way things are; it's not going to
		change.

				RANDAL
		Make them change.

				DANTE
		I can't, all right! Jesus, would
		you leave me alone? I can't make
		changes like that in my life. If I
		could, I would-but I don't have the
		ability to risk comfortable
		situations on the big money and the
		fabulous prizes.

				RANDAL
		Who're you kidding? You can so.

				DANTE
		Jesus H. Christ, I can't!

				RANDAL
		So you'll continue being miserable

		don't have the guts to face change?

				DANTE

		My mother told me once that when I

		So.

		"A dollar eighty for soda? I should

		feel like driving there. I'll just
		buy it here so I don't have to

		You still didn't have to choke me.

				DANTE
		Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't
		kill you.

				RANDAL
		Why do you say that?

				DANTE
		Why do I say that? Randal...forget
		it.

									140.


				RANDAL
		No, really. What did I do that was
		so wrong?

				DANTE
		What don't you do? Randal, sometimes
		it seems like the only reason you
		come to work is to make my life
		miserable.

				RANDAL
		How do you figure?

				DANTE
		What time did you get to work today?

				RANDAL
		Like ten after.

				DANTE
		You were over half an hour late.
		Then all you do is come over here.

				RANDAL
		To talk to you.

				DANTE
		Which means the video store is
		ostensibly closed.

				RANDAL
		It's not like I'm miles away.

				DANTE
		Unless you're out renting videos at
		other video stores.

				RANDAL
		Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we
		could watch it together!

				DANTE
		You get my slapped with a fine, you
		fight with the customers and I have
		to patch everything up. You get us
		chased out of a funeral by violating
		a corpse. To top it all off, you
		ruin my relationship. What's your
		encore? Do you anally rape my
		mother while pouring sugar in my
		gas tank?
				(MORE)

									141.


				DANTE (CONT'D)
			(sighs)
		You know what the real tragedy is?
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

				RANDAL
			(suddenly outraged)
		Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to
		you trying to pass the buck again.
		I'm the source of all your misery.
		Who closed the store to play hockey?
		Who closed the store to attend a
		wake? Who tried to win back an ex-
		girlfriend without even discussing
		how he felt with his present one?
		You wanna blame somebody, blame
		yourself.
			(beat, as DANTE)
		"I'm not even supposed to be here
		today."
			(whips stuff at DANTE)
		You sound like an asshole. Whose
		choice was it to be here today?
		Nobody twisted your arm. You're
		here today of your own violation,
		my friend. But you'd like to
		believe that the weight of the
		world rests on your shoulders-that
		the store would crumble if Dante
		wasn't here. Well, I got news for
		you, jerk: This store would survive
		without you. Without me either. All
		you do is overcompensate for having
		what's basically a monkey's job:
		You push fucking buttons. Any moron
		can waltz in here and do our jobs,
		but you're obsessed with making it
		seem so much more fucking important,
		so much more epic than it really is.
		You work in a convenience store,
		Dante. And badly, I might add. And
		I work in a shitty video store.
		Badly, as well.
			(beat)
		You know, that guy Jay's got it
		right-he has no delusions about
		what he does. Us? We like to make
		ourselves seem so much better than
		the people that come in here, just
		looking to pick up a paper or-God
		forbid-cigarettes. We look down on
		them, as it we're so advanced.
		Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
		then what are we doing working here?

									142.


	RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong
	words alone.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.

				RANDAL
		I threw out the stuff that got
		broken. The floor looks clean.

				DANTE
		You need a ride?

				RANDAL
			(looks out door)
		Got one. Just pulled up.

	They stand in silence. Then...

				DANTE
		Do you work tomorrow?

				RANDAL
		Same time. What about you?

				DANTE
		I'm calling out. Going to hit the
		hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then
		try to see Veronica.

				RANDAL
		You wanna grab something to eat
		tomorrow night...after I get out of
		here?

				DANTE
		I'll call you. Let you know.

				RANDAL
		All right. Good luck with Veronica.
		If you want, I can talk to her, you
		know, and explain...

				DANTE
		No thanks. I'll take care of it.
		We've got a lot of shit to talk
		about.

									143.


				RANDAL
		Helluva day.

				DANTE
		To say the least.

				RANDAL
		Do you need a hug or something?
		'Cause I would have no hang-ups
		about hugging you...you know, you
		being a guy and all. Just don't
		knead my ass when you do it.

				DANTE
		Get the fuck outta here already.

				RANDAL
		I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

	RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE
	the sheet-sign.

				RANDAL
		You're closed.

	He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

	DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open
	and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

	POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

				DANTE
		What'd you forget something?
			(looks up, surprised)
		Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.

	A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.
	He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

	JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on
	the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs
	a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of
	change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the
	frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

	CREDITS

	Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes
	to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for
	a clerk, looks down the aisles.

				CUSTOMER
		Hello? Little help?

									144.


	No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to
	make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the
	counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.
"Clerks."

	INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS

	A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

	A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

	A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,
	Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark
	Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs
	askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the
	corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly
	atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a
	resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR
	swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE
	rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking
	it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his
	back to the camera, phone in hand.

				FIGURE
			(groggily)
		Hello...What?...No, I don't work
		today...I'm playing hockey at two.

	THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

				FIGURE (O.C.)
		Why don't you call Randal?...
		Because I'm fucking tired....I just
		closed last night....
			(deep sigh)
		Jesus...What time are you going to
		come in?...Twelve...Be there be
		twelve?...Swear...

	A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is
	decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

				FIGURE (O.C.)
		Swear you'll be in by twelve and
		I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I
		walk.

	THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE
	slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair
	and stands.

	THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The
	Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It
	is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is
	Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

				DANTE
		Next time, I get the bed.

										2.


	He releases the dog and sits up.

				DANTE
			(exhausted)
		Shit.

						CUT TO:

	INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER

	A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from
	the toilet.

						CUT TO:

	INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER

	A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He
	grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

						CUT TO:

	INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER

	Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two
	scoops, three scoops, four scoops.

						CUT TO:

	INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER

	DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet
	for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.
	THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

						CUT TO:

	INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER

	DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from
	atop a VCR.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER

	A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

						CUT TO:

										3.


	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground
	from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens
	it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the
	store.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the
	lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the
	convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the
	camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a
	knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack
	remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.
	Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in
	the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes
	to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY
	PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of
	papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls
	his eyes as it occurs to him.

				DANTE
		Shit.

	The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE

	Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE
	approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls
	the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he
	reaches toward the camera.

	DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press
	vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand
	as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but
	the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops
	him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

						CUT TO:

										4.


	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding
	flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He
	looks down at it.

				DANTE
		Shit!

	The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and
	obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.
	DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car
	trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a
	folded white sheet.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips
	his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on
	the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the
	sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I
	ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to
	OPEN.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

	The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the
	morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then
	drops his head in his hands. The day has begun.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim
	morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.

						CUT TO:

										5.


	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

				DANTE
		Thanks. Have a good one.

				ACTIVIST
		Do you mind if I drink this here?

				DANTE
		Sure. Go ahead.

	The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.
	Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.

				CUSTOMER
		Are you open?

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.

				ACTIVIST
		Are you sure?

				CUSTOMER
		Am I sure?

				ACTIVIST
		Are you sure?

				CUSTOMER
		Am I sure about what?

				ACTIVIST
		Do you really want to buy those
		cigarettes?

				CUSTOMER
		Are you serious?

				ACTIVIST
		How long have you been smoking?

				CUSTOMER
			(to DANTE)
		What is this, a poll?

				DANTE
		Beats me.

										6.


				ACTIVIST
		How long have you been a smoker?

				CUSTOMER
		Since I was thirteen.

	The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens
	it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

				ACTIVIST
		I'd say you're about nineteen,
		twenty, am I right?

				CUSTOMER
		What the hell is that?

				ACTIVIST
		That's your lung. By this time,
		your lung looks like this.

				CUSTOMER
		You're shittin' me.

				ACTIVIST
		You think I'm shitting you...

	The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

				CUSTOMER
		What's this?

				ACTIVIST
		It's a trach ring. It's what they
		install in your throat when throat
		cancer takes your voice box. This
		one came out of a sixty-year-old man.

				CUSTOMER
			(drops ring)
		Unnhh!

				ACTIVIST
			(picks up the ring)
		He smoked until the day he died.
		Used to put the cigarette in this
		thing and smoke it that way.

				DANTE
		Excuse me, but...

										7.


				ACTIVIST
		This is where you're heading. A
		cruddy lung, smoking through a hole
		in your throat. Do you really want
		that?

				CUSTOMER
		Well, if it's already too late...

				ACTIVIST
		It's never too late. Give those
		cigarettes back now, and buy some
		gum instead.
			(grabs nearby pack, reads)
		Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.

				CUSTOMER
		It's not the same.

				ACTIVIST
		It's cheaper than cigarettes. And
		it certainly beats this.

	Hands him a picture.

				CUSTOMER
		Jesus!

				ACTIVIST
		It's a picture of a cancer-ridden
		lung. Keep it.

				CUSTOMER
			(to DANTE)
		I'll just take the gum.

				DANTE
		Fifty-five.

				ACTIVIST
		You've made a wise choice. Keep up
		the good work.

	The CUSTOMER exits.

				DANTE
		Maybe you should take that coffee
		outside.

				ACTIVIST
		No, I think I'll drink it in here,
		thanks.

										8.


				DANTE
		If you're going to drink it in
		here, I'd appreciate it if you'd
		not bother the customers.

				ACTIVIST
		Okay. I'm sorry about that.

	Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.
			(looks at model)
		What's that?

				ACTIVIST
		This? How long have you been smoking?

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT
	BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of
	SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam
	dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

				JAY
		WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH!

	SILENT BOB lights a smoke.

				JAY
		I feel good today, Silent Bob.
		We're gonna make some money! And
		then you know what we're going to
		do? We're going to go to that party
		and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck
		this bitch, that bitch...
			(Blue Velvet Hopper)
		I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES!

	SILENT BOB points to something off-screen.

				JAY
			(to O.C.)
		What you looking at?! I'll kick
		your fucking ass!
			(to SILENT BOB)
		Doesn't that motherfucker still owe
		me ten bucks?

	SILENT BOB nods.

										9.


				JAY
		Tonight, you and me are going off
		that fucker's head, and take out
		his fucking soul! Remind me if he
		tries to buy something from us, to
		cut it with leafs and twigs...or
		fucking shit in the motherfucker's
		bag!

	Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them.

				JAY
		Wa sup sluts?
			(to SILENT BOB)
		Damn Silent Bob! You one rude
		motherfucker! But you're cute as
		hell.
			(slowly drops to knees)
		I wanna go down on you, and suckle
		you.
			(makes blow job neck-jerks)
		And then, I wanna line up three
		more guys, and make like a circus
		seal...

	JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,
	looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little
	humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.

				JAY
		Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I
		fucking hate guys!
			(yelling)
		I LOVE WOMEN!
			(calmer)
		Neh.

	A GUY comes up to them.

				GUY
		You selling?

				JAY
			(all business)
		I got hits, hash, weed, and later
		on I'll have 'shrooms. We take
		cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It
	has become something of a rally.

									10.


				ACTIVIST
		You're spending what? Twenty,
		thirty dollars a week on cigarettes.

				LISTENER 1
		Forty.

				LISTENER 2
		Fifty-three.

				ACTIVIST
		Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay
		someone that much money every week
		to kill you? Because that's what
		you're doing now, by paying for the
		so-called privilege to smoke!

				LISTENER 3
		We all gotta go sometime...

				ACTIVIST
		It's that kind of mentality that
		allows this cancer-producing
		industry to thrive. Of course we're
		all going to die someday, but do we
		have to pay for it? Do we have to
		actually throw hard-earned dollars
		on a counter and say, "Please,
		please, Mister Merchant of Death,
		sir; please sell me something that
		will give me bad breath, stink up
		my clothes, and fry my lungs."

				LISTENER 1
		It's not that easy to quit.

				ACTIVIST
		Of course it's not; not when you
		have people like this mindless
		cretin so happy and willing to sell
		you nails for your coffin!

				DANTE
		Hey, now wait a sec...

				ACTIVIST
		Now he's going to launch into his
		rap about how he's just doing his
		job; following orders.
				(MORE)

									11.


				ACTIVIST (CONT'D)
		Friends, let me tell you about
		another bunch of hate mongers that
		were just following orders: they
		were called Nazis, and they
		practically wiped a nation of
		people from the Earth...just like
		cigarettes are doing now! Cigarette
		smoking is the new Holocaust, and
		those that partake in the practice
		of smoking or sell the wares that
		promote it are the Nazis of the
		nineties! He doesn't care how many
		people die from it! He smiles as
		you pay for your cancer sticks and
		says, "Have a nice day."

				DANTE
		I think you'd better leave now.

				ACTIVIST
		You want me to leave? Why? Because
		somebody is telling it like it is?
		Somebody's giving these fine people
		a wake-up call?!

				DANTE
		You're loitering in here, and
		causing a disturbance.

				ACTIVIST
		You're the disturbance, pal! And
		here...
			(slaps a dollar on
			the counter)
		I'm buying some...what's
		this?...Chewlie's Gum. There. I'm
		no longer loitering. I'm a customer,
		a customer engaged in a discussion
		with other customers.

				LISTENER 2
			(to DANTE)
		Yeah, now shut up so he can speak!

				ACTIVIST
		Oh, he's scared now! He sees the
		threat we present! He smells the
		changes coming, and the loss of
		sales when the nonsmokers finally
		demand satisfaction. We demand the
		right to breathe cleaner air!

									12.


				LISTENER 3
		Yeah!

				ACTIVIST
		We'd rather chew our gum than
		embrace slow death! Let's abolish
		this heinous practice of sucking
		poison, and if it means ruffling
		the feathers of a convenience store
		idiot, then so be it!

				DANTE
		That's it, everybody out.

				ACTIVIST
		We're not moving! We have a right,
		a constitutional right, to assemble
		and be heard!

				DANTE
		Yeah, but not in here.

				ACTIVIST
		What better place than this? To
		stamp it out, you gotta start at
		the source!

				DANTE
		Like I'm responsible for all the
		smokers!

				ACTIVIST
		The ones in this town, yes! You
		encourage their growth, their habit.
		You're the source in this area, and
		we're going to shut you down for
		good! For good, cancer-merchant!

	The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

				CROWD
		Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!
		Cancer merchant!

	VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws
	cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a
	loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the
	throng. Everyone turns to face...

	VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding
	a fire extinguisher.

				VERONICA
		Who's leading this mob?

									13.


	The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

				SOMEONE
		That guy.

	The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward
	the door.

				VERONICA (O.C.)
		Freeze.

	VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of
	the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

				VERONICA
		Let's see some credentials.

	He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher
	nozzle at him, warningly.

				VERONICA
		Slowly...

	He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads
	it.

				VERONICA
		You're a Chewlie's Gum
		representative?

	He nods.

				VERONICA
		And you're stirring up all this
		antismoking sentiment
		to...what?...sell more gum?

	He nods again.

				VERONICA
			(through gritted teeth)
		Get out of here.

	He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he
	exits.

				VERONICA
			(to the crowd)
		And you people: Don't you have jobs
		to go to? Get out of here and go
		commute.

	The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic
	glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.

									14.


	VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

				VERONICA
		You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
		Easily led automatons. Try thinking
		for yourself before you pelt and
		innocent man with cigarettes.

	The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire
	extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the
	floor, head in his folded arms.

				VERONICA
		It looked like Tiananmen Square in
		here for a second.

	DANTE is silent.

				VERONICA
		"Thank you, Veronica; you saved me
		from an extremely ugly mob scene."

	DANTE remains silent.

				VERONICA
			(sits beside him)
		Okay, champ. What's wrong?

	DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

				VERONICA
		All right, stupid question. But
		don't you think you're taking this
		a bit too hard?

				DANTE
		Too hard?! I don't have enough
		indignities in my life-people start
		throwing cigarettes at me!

				VERONICA
		At least they weren't lit.

				DANTE
		I hate this fucking place.

				VERONICA
		Then quit. You should be going to
		school anyway...

				DANTE
		Please, Veronica. Last thing I need
		is a lecture at this point.

									15.


				VERONICA
		All I'm saying is that if you're
		unhappy you should leave.

				DANTE
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

				VERONICA
		I know. I stopped by your house and
		your mom said you left at like six
		or something.

				DANTE
		The guy got sick and couldn't come
		in.

				VERONICA
		Don't you have a hockey game at two?

				DANTE
		Yes! And I'm going to play like
		shit because I didn't get a good
		night's sleep!

				VERONICA
		Why did you agree to come in then?

				DANTE
		I'm only here until twelve, then
		I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

				VERONICA
		Why don't you open the shutters and
		get some sunlight in here?

				DANTE
		Somebody jammed the locks with gum.

				VERONICA
		You're kidding.

				DANTE
		Bunch of savages in this town.

				VERONICA
		You look bushed. What time did you
		get to bed?

				DANTE
		I don't know-like two-thirty, three.

				VERONICA
		What were you doing up so late?

									16.


				DANTE
			(skirting)
		Hunhh? Nothing.

				VERONICA
			(persistent)
		What were you doing?

				DANTE
		Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with
		you now?

				VERONICA
		Who's fighting? Why are you so
		defensive?

				DANTE
		Who's defensive? Just...Would you
		just hug me?! All right? Your
		boyfriend was accosted by an angry
		mob, and he needs to be hugged.

	She stares at him.

				DANTE
		What? What is that?

				VERONICA
		She called you, didn't she?

				DANTE
		Oh, be real! Would you...Would you
		please hug me? I just went through
		a very traumatic experience and I
		haven't been having the best day so
		far. Now come on.

	VERONICA stares at him.

				DANTE
		What? What's with that look?! I
		wasn't talking to anyone, especially
		her! Look at you, being all sort
		of...I don't know...stand-offish.

	VERONICA looks away.

				DANTE
		Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug
		me. I see how it is. All right
		Pissy-pants, you just go on being
		suspicious and quiet. I don't even
		want to hug you at this point.

	VERONICA looks back at him.

				DANTE
			(pleadingly)
		Give you a dollar?

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

	A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:

	PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN
	APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.

	DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the
	counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her
	chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.

				DANTE
			(to O.C. customer)
		Thanks.

	The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.

				VERONICA
		How much money did you leave up
		there?

				DANTE
		Like three dollars in mixed change
		and a couple of singles. People
		only get the paper of coffee this
		time of morning.

				VERONICA
		You're trusting.

				DANTE
		Why do you say that?

				VERONICA
		How do you know they're taking the
		right amount of change? Or even
		paying for what they take?

				DANTE
		Theoretically, people see money on
		the counter and nobody around, they
		think they're being watched.

				VERONICA
		Honesty through paranoia. Why do
		you smell like shoe polish?

									18.


				DANTE
		I had to use shoe polish to make
		that sign. The smell won't come off.

				VERONICA
		Do you think anyone can see us down
		here?

				DANTE
		Why? You wanna have sex or something?

				VERONICA
			(sarcastic)
		Ooh! Can we?!

				DANTE
		Really?

				VERONICA
		I was kidding.

				DANTE
		Yeah, right. You can't get enough
		of me.

				VERONICA
		Typically male point of view.

				DANTE
		How do you figure?

				VERONICA
		You show some bedroom proficiency,
		and you think you're gods. What
		about what we do for you?

				DANTE
		Women? Women, as lovers, are all
		basically the same: they just have
		to be there.

				VERONICA
		"Be there?"

				DANTE
		Making a male climax is not all
		that challenging: insert somewhere
		close and preferably moist; thrust;
		repeat.

				VERONICA
		How flattering.

									19.


				DANTE
		Now, making a woman cum...therein
		lies a challenge.

				VERONICA
		Oh, you think so?

				DANTE
		A girl makes a guy cum, it's
		standard. A guy makes a girl cum,
		it's talent.

				VERONICA
		And I actually date you?

				DANTE
		Something wrong?

				VERONICA
		I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan,
		it takes more than that to get a
		guy off. Just "being there"-as you
		put it-is not enough.

				DANTE
		I touched a nerve.

				VERONICA
		I'm astonished to hear you
		trivialize my role in our sex life.

				DANTE
		It wasn't directed at you. I was
		making a broad generalization.

				VERONICA
		You were making a generalization
		about "broads!"

				DANTE
		These are my opinions based on my
		experiences with the few women who
		were good enough to sleep with me.

				VERONICA
		How many?

				DANTE
		How many what?

				VERONICA
		How many girls have you slept with?

									20.


				DANTE
		How many different girls? Didn't we
		already have this discussion once?

				VERONICA
		We might have; I don't remember.
		How many?

				DANTE
		Including you?

				VERONICA
		It better be up to and including me.

				DANTE
			(pause to count)
		Twelve.

				VERONICA
		You've slept with twelve different
		girls?

				DANTE
		Including you; yes.

	Pause. She slaps him.

				DANTE
		What the hell was that for?

				VERONICA
		You're a pig.

				DANTE
		Why'd you hit me?

				VERONICA
		Do you know how many different men
		I've had sex with?

				DANTE
		Do I get to hit you after you tell
		me?

				VERONICA
		Three.

				DANTE
		Three?

				VERONICA
		Three including you.

									21.


				DANTE
		You've only had sex with three
		different people?

				VERONICA
		I'm not the pig you are.

				DANTE
		Who?

				VERONICA
		You!

				DANTE
		No; who were the three, besides me?

				VERONICA
		John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.

				DANTE
			(with true admiration)
		Wow. That's great. That's something
		to be proud of.

				VERONICA
		I am. And that's why you should
		feel like a pig. You men make me
		sick. You'll sleep with anything
		that says yes.

				DANTE
		Animal, vegetable, or mineral.

				VERONICA
		Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

				DANTE
		They put up the least amount of
		struggle.

				VERONICA
		After dropping a bombshell like
		that, you owe me. Big.

				DANTE
		All right. Name it.

				VERONICA
		I want you to come with me on Monday.

				DANTE
		Where?

									22.


				VERONICA
		To school. There's a seminar about
		getting back into a scholastic
		program after a lapse in enrollment.

				DANTE
		Can't we ever have a discussion
		without that coming up?

				VERONICA
		It's important to me, Dante. You
		have so much potential that just
		goes to waste in this pit. I wish
		you'd go back to school.

				DANTE
		Jesus, would you stop? You make my
		head hurt when you talk about this.

	VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.

				DANTE
		Shit! Why are we getting up?

				VERONICA
		Unlike you, I have a class in
		forty-five minutes.

	A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.
	VERONICA reacts to him.

				VERONICA
			(surprised)
		Willam!

				WILLAM
		Ronnie! How are you? You work here
		now?

				VERONICA
			(locks arms with DANTE)
		No, I'm just visiting my man.
			(to DANTE)
		Dante, this is Willam Black.
			(to WILLAM)
		This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

				DANTE
		How are you? Just the soda?

				WILLAM
		And a pack of cigarettes.
			(to VERONICA; paying)
		Are you still going to Seton Hall?

									23.


				VERONICA
		No, I transferred into Monmouth
		this year. I was tired of missing
		him.
			(squeezes DANTE'S arm)


				WILLAM
		Do you still talk to Sylvan?

				VERONICA
		I just talked to her on Monday. We
		still hang out on weekends.

				WILLAM
			(leaving)
		That's cool. Well-you two lovebirds
		take it easy, all right?

				VERONICA
		I will. Take it easy.

				WILLAM
		Bye.
			(exits)


				VERONICA
		Bye
			(to DANTE)
		That was Snowball.

				DANTE
		Why do you call him that?

				VERONICA
		Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job
		thing.

				DANTE
		What do you mean?

				VERONICA
		After he gets a blow job, he likes
		to have the cum spit back into his
		mouth while kissing. It's called
		snowballing.

				DANTE
		He requested this?

				VERONICA
		He gets off on it.

									24.


				DANTE
		Sylvan can be talked into anything.

				VERONICA
		Why do you say that?

				DANTE
		Like you said-she snowballed him.

				VERONICA
		Sylvan? No; I snowballed him.

				DANTE
		Yeah, right.

				VERONICA
		I'm serious...

	A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.

				DANTE
		You sucked that guy's dick?

				VERONICA
		Yeah. How do you think I know he
		liked...

				DANTE
			(panicky)
		But...but you said you only had sex
		with three guys! You never mentioned
		him!

				VERONICA
		That's because I never had sex with
		him!

				DANTE
		You sucked his dick!

				VERONICA
		We went out a few times. We didn't
		have sex, but we fooled around.

				DANTE
			(massive panic attack)
		Oh my God! Why did you tell me you
		only slept with three guys?

				VERONICA
		Because I did only sleep with three
		guys! That doesn't mean I didn't
		just go with people.

									25.


				DANTE
		Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...

				VERONICA
		I'm sorry, Dante. I thought you
		understood.

				DANTE
		I did understand! I understand that
		you slept with three different
		guys, and that's all you said.

				VERONICA
		Please calm down.

				DANTE
		How many?

				VERONICA
		Dante...

				DANTE
		How many dicks have you sucked?!

				VERONICA
		Let it go...

				DANTE
		HOW MANY?

				VERONICA
		All right! Shut up a second and
		I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't
		freak like this when you told me
		how many girls you fucked.

				DANTE
		This is different. This is important.
		How many?!

	She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on
	a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.

				DANTE
		Well...?

				VERONICA
			(half-mumbled)
		Something like thirty-six.

				DANTE
		WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?

									26.


				VERONICA
		Lower your voice!

				DANTE
		What the hell is that anyway,
		"something like thirty-six?" Does
		that include me?

				VERONICA
		Um. Thirty-seven.

				DANTE
		I'M THIRTY-SEVEN?

				VERONICA
			(walking away)
		I'm going to class.

				DANTE
		Thirty-seven?!
			(to CUSTOMER)
		My girlfriend sucked thirty-seven
		dicks!

				CUSTOMER
		In a row?

	DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.

				DANTE
		Hey! Where are you going?!

				VERONICA
		Hey listen, jerk! Until today you
		never even knew how many guys I'd
		slept with, because you never even
		asked. And then you act all
		nonchalant about fucking twelve
		different girls. Well, I never had
		sex with twelve different guys!

				DANTE
		No, but you sucked enough dick!

				VERONICA
		Yeah, I went down on a few guys...

				DANTE
		A few?

									27.


				VERONICA
		...And one of those guys was you!
		The last one, I might add, which-if
		you're too stupid to comprehend-
		means that I've been faithful to
		you since we met! All the other
		guys I went with before I met you,
		so, if you want to have a complex
		about it, go ahead! But don't look
		at me like I'm the town whore,
		because you were plenty busy
		yourself, before you met me!

				DANTE
			(a bit more rational)
		Well...why did you have to suck
		their dicks? Why didn't you just
		sleep with them, like any decent
		person?!

				VERONICA
		Because going down it's a big deal!
		I used to like a guy, we'd make
		out, and sooner or later I'd go
		down on him. But I only had sex
		with the guys I loved.

				DANTE
		I feel sick.

				VERONICA
			(holds him)
		I love you. Don't feel sick.

				DANTE
		Every time I kiss you now I'm going
		to taste thirty-six other guys.

	VERONICA violently lets go of him.

				VERONICA
		I'm going to school. Maybe later
		you'll be a bit more rational.

				DANTE
			(pause)
		Thirty-seven. I just can't...

				VERONICA
		Goodbye, Dante.

	She exits in a huff. DANTE stands there in silence for a
	moment. Then he swings the door open and yells out.

									28.


				DANTE
		Try not to suck any more dicks on
		your way through the parking lot!

	Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside
	double back and head in the direction. VERONICA went.

				DANTE
		HEY! HEY, YOU! GET BACK HERE!

	A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips
	repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. The IMPATIENT

	Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
			(pissed off)
		I thought that place was supposed
		to be opened at eleven o'clock?
		It's twenty after!

				DANTE
		I called his house twice already.
		He should be here soon.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
		It's not like it's a demanding job.
		I'd like to get paid to sit on my

		walked in there and that sonofabitch
		was sleeping.

				DANTE
		I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
		You calling me a liar?

				DANTE
		No; he was probably just resting
		his eyes.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
		What the hell is that? Resting his

				DANTE
		Actually, that's his night job.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
		Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack

		convenience store instead of doing
		an honest day's work.
			(tosses tape on counter)
		I got no more time to bullshit

		You make sure this gets back. The

		If you'll just tell me the title of

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
			(storming out)
		Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to

			(opening paper)
		I'll bet the most frequent topic of

		Seven months.

				RANDAL
		Chick's nuts about you. How long

				DANTE
		Five years.

				RANDAL
		Chick only made you nuts. She

				DANTE
		Eight and a half.

									35.


				RANDAL
			(looks up from paper)
		Eight and a half?

				DANTE
		Party at John K's-senior year. I
		get blitzed and pass out in his
		bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives
		all over me.

				RANDAL
		That's cheating?

				DANTE
		In the middle of it, she calls me
		Brad.

				RANDAL
		She called you Brad?

				DANTE
		She called me Brad.

				RANDAL
		That's not cheating. People say
		crazy shit during sex. One time, I
		called this girl "Mom."

				DANTE
		I hit the lights and she freaks.
		Turns out she thought I was Brad
		Michaelson.

				RANDAL
		What do you mean?

				DANTE
		She was supposed to meet Brad
		Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked
		the wrong one. She had no idea I
		was even at the party.

				RANDAL
		Oh, my God.

				DANTE
		Great story, isn't it?

				RANDAL
		That girl was vile to you.

									36.


				DANTE
		Interesting postscript to that
		story: Do you know who wound up
		going with Brad Michaelson in the
		other dark bedroom?

				RANDAL
		Your mother.

				DANTE
		Allan Harris.

				RANDAL
		Chess team Allan Harris?!

				DANTE
		The two moved to Idaho together
		after graduation. They raise sheep.

				RANDAL
		That's frightening.

				DANTE
		It takes different strokes to move
		the world.

				RANDAL
		In light of this lurid tale, I
		don't see how you could even
		romanticize your relationship with
		Caitlin-she broke your heart and
		inadvertently drove men to deviant
		lifestyles.

				DANTE
		Because there was a lot of good in
		our relationship.

				RANDAL
		Oh yeah.

				DANTE
		I'm serious. Aside from the
		cheating, we were a great couple.
		That's what high school's all
		about-algebra, bad lunch, and
		infidelity.

				RANDAL
		You think things would be any
		different now?

									37.


				DANTE
		They are. When she calls me now,
		she's a different person-she's
		frightened and vulnerable. She's
		about to finish college and enter
		the real world. That's got to be
		scary for anyone.

				RANDAL
			(suddenly recalling)
		Oh shit, I've got to place an order.

				DANTE
		I'm talking to myself here.

				RANDAL
		No, no, I'm listening. She's
		leaving college, and...?

				DANTE
		...and she's looking to me for
		support. And I think that this is
		leading our relationship to a new
		level.

				RANDAL
		What about Veronica?

				DANTE
		I think the arguments Veronica and
		I are having are some kind of
		manifestation of a subconscious
		desire to break away from her so
		that I can pursue the possibility
		of a more meaningful relationship
		with Caitlin.

				RANDAL
		Caitlin's on the same wave-length?

				DANTE
		I think it's safe to say yes.

				RANDAL
		Then I think all four of you had
		better sit down and talk it over.

				DANTE
		All four?

				RANDAL
		You, Veronica, Caitlin...

				DANTE
		Yes, I'd like to check on a misprint
		in today's edition...Today's
		edition...It says "Bree to Wed
		Asian Design Major...No, no;
		everything's spelled fine. I just
		wanted to know if the piece was a
		misprint...I don't know, like a
		typographical error or something...

	A CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the
	litter box. A black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts
	pawing around.

				DANTE (O.C.)
		Maybe it's supposed to be Caitlin
		Bray, or Caitlin Bre, with one
		e...I'm a curious party...A curious
		party...

	DANTE on the phone:

				DANTE
		...I'm an ex-boyfriend...Well, it's
		just that we talk all the time, and
		she never mentioned this engagement,
		which is why I'm thinking maybe
		it's a misprint...

	The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning
	on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load.

				DANTE (O.C.)
		...Are you sure?...Maybe there's
		like a vindictive printer working
		for you...

	DANTE on the phone:

				DANTE
		Meaning like someone who maybe-I
		don't know-asked her out once and
		got shot down, and his revenge is
		throwing this bogus article in when
		the paper went to
		press...Hello?...Hello?

	DANTE hangs up. He looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his
	head. He then sniffs the air.

	JAY, SILENT BOB and OLAF lean against wall.

				JAY
		"Not in me." That's what she says.
		I gotta pull out and spank it to
		get it on. So I blow a nut on her
		belly, and I get out of there, just
		as my uncle walks in. It was such a
		close call. I tell you what,
		though, I don't care if she is my
		cousin, I'm gonna knock those boots

		Oh shit, look who it is. The human

		Check this out, he's from Russia.

		No way.

	SILENT BOB shakes his head:

		See? And Silent Bob never told a

				GIRL 2
		What part of Russia?

				JAY
		I don't fucking know. What am I,

	OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB.

		Home.

		He only speaks Russian?

				JAY
		He knows some English, but he can't

		He's moving to the big city next

	OLAF makes a metal face.

		That's his fucking metal face.

				JAY
		I don't know, man. He's a fucking

				GIRL 2
		He really wants to play metal?

				JAY
		He's got his own band in Moscow.
		It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue
		Jeans" or something like that.

				GIRL 1
		That doesn't sound metal.

				JAY
		You gotta hear him sing.
			(to OLAF)
		Olaf, "Berserker!"

	OLAF laughs and shakes his head.

				JAY
		Come on, man, "Berserker!"

				GIRL 2
		Does he sing in English or Russian?

				JAY
		English.
			(to OLAF)
		Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think
		sexy.

				OLAF

		Da. Da.

		He's gonna sing it. This is too

		Wait, there's more.

		Return of the Jedi.

				DANTE
		Didn't you hear me? Caitlin really
		is getting married.

				RANDAL
		Which did you like better: Jedi or
		The Empire Strikes Back.

				DANTE
			(exasperated)
		Empire.

				RANDAL
		Blasphemy.

				DANTE
		Empire had the better ending: Luke
		gets his hand cut off, and finds
		out Vader's his father; Han gets
		frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.
		It ends on such a down note. And
		that's life-a series of down
		endings. All Jedi had was a bunch
		of Muppets.

				RANDAL
		There was something else going on
		in Jedi. I never noticed it until
		today.

	RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store.

				DANTE
		What's that?

				RANDAL
		All right, Vader's boss...

				DANTE
		The Emperor.

				RANDAL
		Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor
		is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?

				DANTE
		How do you mean?

				RANDAL
		Well, he's like the pope for the
		dark side of the Force. He's a holy
		man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an
		evil one.

									47.


				DANTE
		I guess.

				RANDAL
		Now, he's in charge of the Empire.
		The Imperial government is under
		his control. And the entire galaxy
		is under Imperial rule.

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				RANDAL
		Then wouldn't that logically mean
		that it's a theocracy? If the head
		of the Empire is a priest of some
		sort, then it stands to reason that
		the government is therefore one
		based on religion.

				DANTE
		It would stand to reason, yes.

				RANDAL
		Hence, the Empire was a fascist
		theocracy, and the rebel forces
		were therefore battling religious
		persecution.

				DANTE
		More or less.

				RANDAL
		The only problem is that at no
		point in the series did I ever hear
		Leia or any of the rebels declare a
		particular religious belief.

				DANTE
		I think they were Catholics.

	A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Are you open?

				DANTE
		Yeah. Come in.

	He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe.

				RANDAL
		You know what else I noticed in Jedi?

									48.


				DANTE
		There's more?

				RANDAL
		So they build another Death Star,
		right?

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				RANDAL
		Now the first one they built was
		completed and fully operational
		before the Rebels destroyed it.

				DANTE
		Luke blew it up. Give credit where
		it's due.

				RANDAL
		And the second one was still being
		built when they blew it up.

				DANTE
		Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

				RANDAL
		Something just never sat right with
		me the second time they destroyed
		it. I could never put my finger on
		it-something just wasn't right.

				DANTE
		And you figured it out?

				RANDAL
		Well, the thing is, the first Death
		Star was manned by the Imperial
		army-storm troopers, dignitaries-
		the only people onboard were
		Imperials.

				DANTE
		Basically.

				RANDAL
		So when they blew it up, no prob.
		Evil is punished.

				DANTE
		And the second time around...?

									49.


				RANDAL
		The second time around, it wasn't
		even finished yet. They were still
		under construction.

				DANTE
		So?

				RANDAL
		A construction job of that magnitude
		would require a helluva lot more
		manpower than the Imperial army had
		to offer. I'll bet there were
		independent contractors working on
		that thing: plumbers, aluminum
		siders, roofers.

				DANTE
		Not just Imperials, is what you're
		getting at.

				RANDAL
		Exactly. In order to get it built
		quickly and quietly they'd hire
		anybody who could do the job. Do
		you think the average storm trooper
		knows how to install a toilet main?
		All they know is killing and white
		uniforms.

				DANTE
		All right, so even if independent
		contractors are working on the
		Death Star, why are you uneasy with
		its destruction?

				RANDAL
		All those innocent contractors
		hired to do a job were killed-
		casualties of a war they had
		nothing to do with.
			(notices Dante's confusion)
		All right, look-you're a roofer,
		and some juicy government contract
		comes your way; you got the wife
		and kids and the two-story in
		suburbia-this is a government
		contract, which means all sorts of
		benefits. All of a sudden these
		left-wing militants blast you with
		lasers and wipe out everyone within
		a three-mile radius.

				RANDAL (CONT'D)
		You didn't ask for that. You have
		no personal politics. You're just
		trying to scrape out a living.

	The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Excuse me. I don't mean to
		interrupt, but what were you
		talking about?

				RANDAL
		The ending of Return of the Jedi.

				DANTE
		My friend is trying to convince me
		that any contractors working on the
		uncompleted Death Star were innocent
		victims when the space station was
		destroyed by the rebels.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm
		a roofer...
			(digs into pocket and
			produces business card)
		Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements.
		And speaking as a roofer, I can say
		that a roofer's personal politics
		come heavily into play when choosing
		jobs.

				RANDAL
		Like when?

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Three months ago I was offered a
		job up in the hills. A beautiful
		house with tons of property. It was
		a simple reshingling job, but I was
		told that if it was finished within
		a day, my price would be doubled.
		Then I realized whose house it was.

				DANTE
		Whose house was it?

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Dominick Bambino's.

				RANDAL
		"Babyface" Bambino? The gangster?

									51.


				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		The same. The money was right, but
		the risk was too big. I knew who he
		was, and based on that, I passed
		the job on to a friend of mine.

				DANTE
		Based on personal politics.

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
		Right. And that week, the Foresci
		family put a hit on Babyface's
		house. My friend was shot and
		killed. He wasn't even finished
		shingling.

				RANDAL
		No way!

				BLUE-COLLAR MAN
			(paying for coffee)
		I'm alive because I knew there were
		risks involved taking on that
		particular client. My friend wasn't
		so lucky.
			(pauses to reflect)
		You know, any contractor willing to
		work on that Death Star knew the
		risks. If they were killed, it was
		their own fault. A roofer listens
		to this...
			(taps his heart)
		not his wallet.

	The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain
	respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the
	door and pokes her head in.

				WOMAN
		Is that video store open or not?

						CUT TO:

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

		They say so much, but they never
		tell you if it's any good.

	RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		Are either of these any good?

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		Sir!

			(flatly)
		What.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

		Well, have you heard anything about

		No.

		You've never heard anybody say

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER

		Well, how about these two movies?
			(holds up the same two)


	RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up.

				RANDAL
		They suck.

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his
	paper. She has caught him.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		I just held up the same two movies.
		You're not even paying attention.

				RANDAL
		No, I wasn't.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		I don't think your manager would

				RANDAL
			(turning the page)
		I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		I beg your pardon!

				RANDAL
			(reading on)
		Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to
		trick me.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(defending herself)
		I only pointed out that you weren't
		paying any attention to what I was
		saying.

				RANDAL
			(turning page and reading)
		I hope it feels good.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
		You hope what feels good?

									54.


				RANDAL
		I hope it feels so good to be right.
		There is nothing more exhilarating
		than pointing out the shortcomings
		of others, is there?

	The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter
	disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video
	clerk. The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total
	disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL. The INDECISIVE
	CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies
	back onto the wall.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(in a huff)
		Well this is the last time I ever
		rent here...

				RANDAL
		You'll be missed.

				INDECISIVE CUSTOMER
			(losing it altogether)
		Screw you!

	She storms out. RANDAL is offended. He hops over the counter
	and whips the door open.

				RANDAL
			(calling after her)
		You're not allowed to rent here
		anymore!

	RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily,
	totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.

				RANDAL
		Screw me!

	He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys.
	Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside,
	gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the

				DANTE
			(a hand up to urge

		Wait.

				RANDAL
			(looking around)
		She's in here?

				DANTE
		This guy is going through all of

	An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs,
	all opened. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it
	open, and examines each egg carefully.

				DANTE (O.C.)
		This has been going on for twenty
		minutes.

	RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity.

				RANDAL
		What's he looking for?

				DANTE
		He said he has to find a perfect
		dozen.

				RANDAL
		Perfect dozen.

				DANTE
		Each egg has to be perfect.

				RANDAL
		The quest isn't going well?

				DANTE
		Obviously not. Look at all the
		cartons that didn't make the grade.

	The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from
	several different angles.

				RANDAL (O.C.)
		Why doesn't he just mix and match?

				DANTE
		I told him that and he yelled at me.

	RANDAL snickers at his friend.

									56.


				RANDAL
		What did he say?

				DANTE
		He said it was important to have
		standards. He said nobody has pride
		anymore.

				RANDAL
		It's not like you laid the eggs
		yourself.

				DANTE
		I'll give him five more minutes
		then I'm calling the cops. I don't

	A SMOKER steps in.

				SMOKER
		Two packs of cigarettes.

	Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and
	searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at RANDAL and

	The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor. The SMOKER
	looks at RANDAL.

				RANDAL

		I'm as puzzled as you.

				SMOKER
			(paying DANTE)
		I've actually seen it before.

				DANTE
		You know him?

				SMOKER
		No, I've seen that behavior before.
		Looking for the perfect carton of
		eggs, right?

				RANDAL
			(a bit astonished)
		Yeah. How'd you know?

				SMOKER
		I'll bet you a million bucks that
		the guy's a guidance counselor.

									57.


				DANTE
		Why do you say that?

				SMOKER
		I was in the Food City last year
		when the same thing happened,
		different guy though. Stock boy
		told me that the guy had been
		looking through the eggs for like
		half an hour, doing all sorts of
		endurance tests and shit. I ask the
		kid how come nobody called the
		manager, and he says it happens
		twice a week, sometimes more.

				RANDAL
		Get out of here.

				SMOKER
		I kid you not. They call it Shell
		Shock. Only happens with guidance
		counselors for some reason. The kid
		said they used to make a big deal
		about it, but there's no point.

	The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor.
	He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg
	still sitting on the floor.

				SMOKER (O.C.)
		He said they always pay for whatever
		they break and they never bother
		anybody.

	DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man.

				DANTE
		Why guidance counselors?

				SMOKER
		If your job served as little
		purpose as theirs, wouldn't you
		lose it, too?

				RANDAL
		Come to think of it, my guidance
		counselor was kind of worthless.

				SMOKER
			(grabbing matches)
		See? It's important to have a job
		that makes a difference, boys.
		That's why I kill Chinamen for the

		Do you have any new movies in?

	MONTAGE INSERT #3/DUMB QUESTIONS

	A series of people standing in various locations throughout
	the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions.

				FIRST
			(holding coffee)
		What do you mean there's no ice?
		You mean I've gotta drink this
		coffee hot?!

				SECOND
			(holding up item from
			clearly marked $.99 display)
		How much?

				THIRD
			(peeking in door)
		Do you sell hubcaps?

	END INSERT

				RANDAL
		See? You vented. Don't you feel
		better now?

				DANTE
		No.

				RANDAL
		Why not?

				DANTE
		Because my ex-girlfriend is getting

				RANDAL
		Jesus, you got a one-track mind.
		It's always Caitlin, Caitlin,
		Caitlin...

				DANTE
			(jerking head toward door)
		Veronica!

	DANTE gives RANDAL a shove to shut him up. VERONICA enters
	the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum
	foil.

				VERONICA
		What happened to home by twelve?

	DANTE is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under
	her arm.

				DANTE
		He still hasn't shown up. Why
		aren't you in class?

				VERONICA
		Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped
		home and brought you some lunch.

				DANTE
		What is it?

				VERONICA
		Peanut butter and jelly with the
		crusts cut off. What do you think
		it is? It's lasagne.

									64.


				DANTE
		Really?
			(kisses her forehead)
		You're the best.

				VERONICA
		I'm glad you've calmed down a bit.
			(to RANDAL)
		Hi, Randal.

		Thirty-seven!

				DANTE
			(to O.C.)
		Shut up!
			(to VERONICA)
		Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still
		not happy about it, but I've been
		able to deal.

	RANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C.

				DANTE
			(to O.C.)
		Why don't you go back to the video
		store?

	RANDAL walks past the two, and pats VERONICA on the head. He
	exits.

				VERONICA
		You had to tell him.

				DANTE
		I had to tell someone. He put it
		into perspective.

				VERONICA
		What did he say?

				DANTE
		At least he wasn't thirty-six.

				VERONICA
		And that made you feel better?

				DANTE
		And he said most of them are
		college guys, I've never met or seen.

									65.


				VERONICA
		The ostrich syndrome: if you don't
		see it...

				DANTE
		...it isn't there. Yes.

				VERONICA
		Thank you for being rational.

				DANTE
		Thank you for the lasagne.

				VERONICA
		You couldn't get these shutters open?

				DANTE
		I called a locksmith and he said
		the earliest he could get here it
		tomorrow.

				VERONICA
		Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back
		for the one-thirty class.

				DANTE
		What time do you get finished?

				VERONICA
		Eight. But I have a sorority
		meeting till nine, so I'll be back
		before you close. Can we go out and
		get some coffee?

				DANTE
		Sure.

				VERONICA
		Good.
			(kisses him)
		I'll see you when you close, then.
		Enjoy the lasagne.

		really went to Vermont?...When the

	He hangs up. RANDAL joins him.

				RANDAL
		Vermont?

				DANTE
		Can you believe this?!

				RANDAL

				DANTE
		Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!

				RANDAL
		So, what-you're stuck here all day?

				DANTE
		FUCK!

				RANDAL
		Why'd you apologize?

				DANTE
		What?

				RANDAL
		I heard you apologize. Why? You
		have every right in the world to be
		mad.

				DANTE
		I know.

				RANDAL
		That seems to be the leitmotif in
		your life; ever backing down.

				DANTE
		I don't back down.

				RANDAL
		Yes, you do. You always back down.
		You assume blame that isn't yours,
		you come in when called as opposed
		to enjoying your day off, you
		buckle like a belt.

				DANTE
		You know what pisses me off the most?

				RANDAL
		The fact that I'm right about your
		buckling?

				DANTE
		I'm going to miss the game.

				RANDAL
		Because you buckled.

				DANTE
		Would you shut the hell up with

				RANDAL
		Don't yell at me, pal.

				DANTE
		Sorry.

				RANDAL
		See? There you go again.

				DANTE
		I can't believe I'm going to miss

		At least we're stuck here together.

		Sanford? Dante...I can't play

	SANFORD skates up and skids to a halt.

		Dante, let me grab a Gatorade.

				DANTE
		If you grab a Gatorade, then

		So?

		So? So nobody's going to want to

		What responsibility? You're closing

				RANDAL
		He's blunt, but he's got a point.

				DANTE
		At least let me maintain some
		semblance of managerial control here.

				SANFORD
		All I'm saying is if you're going

		Fine by me. But you're living in

						CUT TO:

	The sign on the door reads:

	TEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD.

	The PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one.
	ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More
	players join them.

									72.


	From across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a
	store with many men gliding around on the roof.

	On the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player.
	REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls
	his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD
	skates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and
	SILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge
	and JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the
	center of the court.

				DANTE
		Ready?

	PLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and
	holds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off,
	and the ball is in play.

	The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet.
	Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots
	are taken, CU's of various players included.

	INACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the
	sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting
	scored on and more face-offs.

	Below, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He
	reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting
	to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues.

	Below, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other
	impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

	Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of
	the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and
	he watches for a moment before calling out.

				CUSTOMER
		When's this period over?

				SOMEONE (O.C.)
		Eight more minutes!

				CUSTOMER
		Are you shitting me? I want to get
		cigarettes!

	DANTE skids to the sidelines.

		If you can just wait a few more

		I'll be right back. It's almost over.

	He jumps back into the game.

				CUSTOMER
		What the fuck is this?! I want some
		service!

				DANTE (O.C.)
		In a second!

				CUSTOMER
		Fuck in a second! This is...Look at
		you! You can't even pass!

				DANTE (O.C.)
		I can pass!

				CUSTOMER
		How 'bout covering point!? You suck!

	DANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER.

				DANTE
		Who are you to make assessments?

				CUSTOMER
		I'll assess all I want!

				SOMEONE (O.C.)

				CUSTOMER

		Don't pass to this guy! He sucks!

				CUSTOMER
		I can whip your ass.

	Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store,
	face against the glass.

				DANTE (O.C.)
		That's easy to say from over here.

				CUSTOMER (O.C.)
		Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll
		knock your fucking teeth out and
		pass all over your ass.

	The WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the
	roof.

				WOMAN
		Is the convenience store open?

	Above, DANTE and the CUSTOMER shout down at the O.C. WOMAN.

				DANTE AND CUSTOMER
			(simultaneously)
		NO!

				DANTE
			(to CUSTOMER)
		There's a stick over there. You're
		shooting against the goal.
			(to the court)
		REDDING! COME OFF AND LET THIS FUCK
		ON!

	A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball
	drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER
	winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the
	court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls
	to the sidelines.

				DANTE
		Give me another ball.

				SOMEONE (O.C.)
		There are no more.

				DANTE
		What the fuck are you talking about?
		How many balls did you bring?

	SANFORD skates up to him.

									75.


				SANFORD
			(counting)
		There was the orange ball...and the
		orange ball.

	DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over.

				DANTE
		Are there any balls down there?!

				JAY (O.C.)
		'Bout the biggest pair you ever
		seen! NYNNE!!

	DANTE looks around, hyperventilating.

				DANTE
		You only brought one ball?!

				SANFORD
		I thought Redding had like three
		balls!

				REDDING (O.C.)
		I thought Dante had the balls.

				DANTE
		Nobody has another ball?

				SANFORD
		Shit!

				DANTE
		We get...what...twelve minutes of
		game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck!
		Fuck! Fuck!!

		Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell

				RANDAL
		Listen to you.

				DANTE
		I can't help it. At least when we
		were playing hockey outside, I
		could see if anyone wanted to go in.

				RANDAL
		Nobody's there. It's four o'clock
		on a Saturday. How many people ever
		come to the store at four on a
		Saturday?

						CUT TO:

	EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

	DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by
	a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down.
	The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the
	middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

	The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely
	nobody is outside.

				DANTE
			(furious)
		I can't fucking believe you!!

				RANDAL
		I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!

				DANTE
		You knocked the fucking casket
		over, for Chrissakes!

				RANDAL
		I was just leaning on it! It was an
		accident!

				DANTE
		Does anyone ever knock over a
		casket on purpose?

				RANDAL
		So the casket fell over! Big deal!

				DANTE
		Her fucking body fell out!

				RANDAL
		So they'll put her back in! It's
		not like it's gonna matter if she
		breaks something!

				DANTE
			(opening door)
		Just...go! Go open the video store.

									86.


				JAY (O.C.)
			(mimicking)
		Yeah! Open the video store!!

				RANDAL
			(to O.C.)
		Shut the fuck up, junkie!

	JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt
	at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL.

				DANTE
			(to RANDAL)
		Go open the video store.

				JAY
		Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.

				DANTE
			(to JAY)
		How many times I gotta tell you not
		to deal outside the store.

				JAY
		I'm not dealing.

	A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt.

				KID
		You got anything, man?

				JAY
		Yeah, what do you want?

	RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience
	store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the
	IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears,
	flashlight in hand, scanning the ground.

				IMPATIENT CUSTOMER
			(to JAY)
		Hey, did you see a set of keys
		lying around here somewhere?

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

	DANTE rearranges the milk. RANDAL joins him.

				RANDAL
		Let me borrow your car.

									87.


				DANTE
		I don't want to talk to you.

				RANDAL
		Fine. Just lend me your car.

				DANTE
		Why should I loan you my car?

				RANDAL
		I want to rent a movie.

				DANTE
			(pause)
		You want to rent a movie.

	DANTE walks away, shaking his head.

				RANDAL
		What's that for?

				DANTE
		You work in a video store!

	They head back to the counter.

				RANDAL
		I work in a shitty video store. I
		want to go to a good video store so
		I can rent a good movie.

				CUSTOMER
		Are you open?

				DANTE AND RANDAL
			(simultaneously)
		YES!

	The CUSTOMER comes to the counter.

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.
			(pets cat)
		Cute cat. What's its name?

				RANDAL
		Annoying Customer.

	The CUSTOMER lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff.
	DANTE puts up cigarettes.

									88.


				DANTE
		Can you imagine being halfway
		decent to the customers at least
		some of the time?

				RANDAL
		Let me borrow your car.

				DANTE
			(calmer)
		May I be blunt with you?

				RANDAL
		If you must.

				DANTE
		We are employees of Quick Stop
		Convenience and RST video,
		respectively. As such, we have
		certain responsibilities which-
		though it may seem cruel and
		unusual-does include manning our
		posts until closing.

				RANDAL
		I see. So playing hockey and
		attending wakes-these practices are
		standard operating procedure.

				DANTE
		There's a difference. Those were
		obligations. Obligations that could
		not have been met at any later date.
		Now renting videos-that's just
		gratuitous, not to mention
		illogical, considering you work in
		a video store.

	Another CUSTOMER leans in.

				CUSTOMER
		Are you open?

				DANTE
			(rolls his eyes)
		Yes.

				RANDAL
		You know what? I don't think I care
		for you rationale.

									89.


				DANTE
		It's going to have to do for now,
		considering that it's my car that's
		up for request.
			(to CUSTOMER)
		Can I help you?

				CUSTOMER
		Pack of cigarettes.

				RANDAL
		What's your point?

				DANTE
		My point is that you're a clerk,
		paid to do a job. You can't just do
		anything you want while you're
		working.

				CUSTOMER
			(reading tabloid)
		"Space Alien Revealed as Head of
		Time Warner; Reports Stock
		Increase."
			(to DANTE and RANDAL)
		They print any kind of shit in
		these papers.

				DANTE
		They certainly do. Two fifty-five.

				RANDAL
		So your argument is that title
		dictates behavior?

				DANTE
		What?

				RANDAL
		The reasons you won't let me borrow
		your care is because I have a title
		and a job description, and I'm
		supposed to follow it, right?

				DANTE
		Exactly.

				CUSTOMER
			(interjecting)
		I saw one, one time, that said the
		world was ending the next week.
				(MORE)

									90.


				CUSTOMER (CONT'D)
		Then in the next week's paper, they
		said we were miraculously saved at
		the zero hour by a Koala-fish
		mutant bird. Crazy shit.

				RANDAL
			(eyes the CUSTOMER, annoyed)
		So I'm no more responsible for my
		own decisions while I'm here at
		work than, say, the Death Squad
		soldiers in Bosnia?

				DANTE
		That's stretching it. You're not
		being asked to slay children or
		anything.

				RANDAL
		Not yet.
			(sips water)


				CUSTOMER
			(again with the interjections)
		And I remember this one time the
		damn paper said...

	RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.
	The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from
	over the counter. RANDAL makes no move, but remains untouched.
	DANTE plays block.

				CUSTOMER
		I'M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING HEAD!
		YOU FUCKING JERKOFF!

				DANTE
		Sir! Sir, I'm sorry! He didn't mean
		it! He was trying to get me.

				CUSTOMER
		Well, he missed!

				DANTE
		I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund
		your cigarette money, and we'll
		call it even.

									91.


				CUSTOMER
			(considerably calmer;
			takes money)
		This is the last time I ever come
		here.
			(to RANDAL)
		And if I ever see you again, I'm
		gonna break your fucking head open!

	The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL
	salutes him.

				DANTE
			(angrily)
		What the fuck did you do that for?

				RANDAL
		Two reasons: one, I hate when the
		people can't shut up about the
		stupid tabloid headlines.

				DANTE
		Jesus!

				RANDAL
		And two, to make a point: title
		does not dictate behavior.

				DANTE
		What?

				RANDAL
		If title dictated my behavior, as a
		clerk serving the public, I wouldn't
		be allowed to spit a mouthful of
		water at that guy. But I did, so my
		point is that people dictate their
		own behavior. Hence, even though
		I'm a clerk in this video store, I
		choose to go rent videos at Big
		Choice.
			(extends opened palm)
		Agreed?

				DANTE
			(shakes his head;
			hands over keys)
		You're a danger to both the dead
		and the living.

				RANDAL
		I like to think I'm a master of my
		own destiny.

									92.


				DANTE
		Please, get the hell out of here.

				RANDAL
		I know I'm your hero.

	RANDAL exits.

	DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of
	milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt.

				TRAINER
		Sounds to me like somebody needs to
		hit the gym.

				DANTE
		Excuse me?

				TRAINER
		I heard you strain when you put the
		milk in the bag. That milk only
		weighs about seven pounds.

				DANTE
		I didn't strain. I sighed.

				TRAINER
		I don't think so. That was a grunt;
		a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid
		in the stretching of muscles. I'm a
		trainer. I know what that sound
		signifies: you're out of shape.

				DANTE
		I don't think so.

				TRAINER
		Oh, I do. You made the same noise
		when you reached across the counter
		for my cash. Your muscles are thin
		and sadly underutilized.

				DANTE
		They are not.

				TRAINER
		Yes, they are. You're out of shape.

									93.


				DANTE
		What are you talking about? There's
		no fat on this body.

				TRAINER
		No fat, but no tone either. You
		don't get enough exercise.

	A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway.

				HEATHER
		Are you open?

				DANTE
		Yes.

				HEATHER
			(grabs a paper)
		Just the paper.

				DANTE
			(to HEATHER)
		Thirty-fire.

				TRAINER
			(to HEATHER)
		Let me ask you a question: Do you
		think this guy's out of shape?

				HEATHER
			(studies DANTE)
		I don't know. I can't really tell
		from here.

				TRAINER
		He is.

				DANTE
		I am not.

				TRAINER
		How much can you bench?

				DANTE
		I don't know.

				HEATHER
			(studying DANTE)
		I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops.

				DANTE
		I know I can bench more than that!

									94.


				TRAINER
		I think the lady called it.

				HEATHER
		My ex-boyfriend was about his
		height, but he was much bulkier. He
		could bench two-fifty, three
		hundred easy.

				TRAINER
		I do about three-fifty, four.

				HEATHER
		No way!

				TRAINER
			(rolling up sleeve)
		Feel that.

				HEATHER
		That's tight. Solid.

				TRAINER
		Now feel his.
			(to DANTE)
		Roll up your sleeve, chief.

				DANTE
		Oh for God's sake!

				TRAINER
		See? You're ashamed. You know
		you're out of shape. Take my card.
		I can help you tone that body up in
		no time. Get you on an aerobics and
		free-weights program.

	A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter.

				SUITED MAN
		You open?

				DANTE

		Yes.
			(to TRAINER)
		I'm not out of shape.

				SUITED MAN
		Excuse me, but have you been here

				DANTE
		What?

									95.


				HEATHER
			(still studying DANTE)
		He's got those love handles.

				DANTE
			(to HEATHER)
		I don't have love handles.

				SUITED MAN
		Were you working here at about four
		o'clock?

				DANTE
		I've been here since six o'clock
		this morning. Why?

				TRAINER
			(to HEATHER)
		It's probably from being around all
		this food every day.

				HEATHER
		Oh, I know. If I had to work here
		all day, I'd be bloated and out of
		shape, too.

				DANTE
		I'm not out of shape!

				SUITED MAN
		Can I have your name please?

				DANTE
		Dante Hicks. Why? What is this about?

	The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook.

				HEATHER
		You're Dante Hicks? Oh my God! I
		didn't even recognize you!

				TRAINER
		Because he's out of shape.

				DANTE
		Do I know you?

				HEATHER
		You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung
		out with...

				DANTE
		Caitlin Bree. Yeah?

									96.


				HEATHER
		I'm her sister.

				DANTE
		You're Alyssa's sister? Heather?

				HEATHER
		Yep. I remember you got caught in

				TRAINER
		Did you say Caitlin Bree?

				DANTE
		Yeah.

				TRAINER
		Pretty girl, about this girl's
		height-dark hair-gorgeous body?

				DANTE
		Yeah?

				TRAINER
		And your name is Dante Hicks? You
		went to high school with her? You
		played hockey?

				DANTE
		How do you know that?

				TRAINER
		Oh man! Hey, you still going out

				DANTE
		No, she's getting married.

				TRAINER
		To you?

				HEATHER
		To an Asian design major.

				TRAINER
		Shit!
			(to DANTE)
		Don't take this the wrong way, but
		I used to fuck her.

				DANTE
		What?

									97.


				TRAINER
		While you two were dating in high
		school. We're talking four, five
		years ago, back when I drove a
		Trans-Am.

				HEATHER
		Oh my God! You're Rick Derris?

				TRAINER
		Yeah!

				DANTE
		You know him?

				HEATHER
		Caitlin used to talk about him all
		the time.

				TRAINER
		Really?

				HEATHER
		Oh yeah. You were the built older
		guy with the black Trans and the
		big...

				DANTE
		Wait a second!
			(to TRAINER)
		You used to sleep with Caitlin Bree?
		While I was dating her?

				TRAINER
		All the time. That girl was like a
		rabbit.

				DANTE
		I...I don't believe this...

				HEATHER
			(to TRAINER)
		I still remember Caitlin telling us
		about that time you two went to
		that motel-the one with the mirrors
		and the hot tub in the room.

				DANTE
		THE GLADES MOTEL?

									98.


				TRAINER
		Holy shit! She told you about that!
			(to DANTE)
		Buddy of mine worked there. Said he
		watched the whole thing. They used
		to film people at that hotel;
		nobody knew about it.

				HEATHER
		She said one time you set up a tent
		on the beach and you guys did it in
		the middle of this big rainstorm.

				DANTE
		What? When? When did all this shit
		happen?

				TRAINER
		Hey man, that was a long time ago.
		Don't let it get to you.

				HEATHER
		I'm surprised you never found out
		about it, Dante. Everybody in
		school knew-even in my class.

				DANTE
		Jesus Christ, what next?

	The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and
	hands it to DANTE.

				SUITED MAN
		Here you go.

				DANTE
		What's this?

				SUITED MAN
		A fine, for five hundred dollars.

				DANTE
		WHAT?

				TRAINER
		Five hundred bucks? What for?

				SUITED MAN
		For violation of New Jersey Statute
		Section Two A, number one-seventy
		slash fifty-one: Any person who
		sells or makes available tobacco or
		tobacco-related products to persons
		under the age of eighteen is
		regarded as disorderly.

									99.


				DANTE
		What are you talking about?

				SUITED MAN
		According to the NJAC-the New
		Jersey Administrative Code, section
		eighteen, five, slash twelve point
		five-a fine of no less than two
		hundred and fifty dollars is to be
		leveled against any person reported
		selling cigarettes to a minor.

				DANTE
		I didn't do that!

				SUITED MAN
		You said you were here all day?

				DANTE
		Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes
		to any kids!

				SUITED MAN
		An angry mother called the state
		division of taxation and complained
		that the man working at Quick Stop
		Convenience sold her five-year-old
		daughter cigarettes today at around
		four o'clock. Division of taxation
		calls the State Board of Health,
		and they send me down here to issue
		a fine. You say you were working
		all day, hence the fine is yours.
		It's doubled due to the incredibly
		young age of the child.

				DANTE
		But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kid!

				TRAINER
		To a five-year-old kid? What a
		scumbag!

				HEATHER
		That's sick, Dante.

				DANTE
		I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kids! I swear!

									100.


				SUITED MAN
		The due date is on the bottom. This
		summons cannot be contested in any
		court of law. Failure to remit
		before the due date will result in
		a charge of criminal negligence,
		and a warrant will be issued for
		your arrest. Have a nice day.

	The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow.

				DANTE
		But I didn't sell cigarettes to any
		kids! Hey!

				TRAINER
			(takes back the card)
		Forget it. I don't want to deal
		with a guy that sells cigarettes to
		a five-year-old.
			(to HEATHER)
		Can I offer you a ride somewhere?

				HEATHER
		Sure. How about the beach?

				TRAINER
		I like the way you think.

	The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his
	forehead.

				DANTE
		Jesus! What next?

				VOICE (O.C.)
		Dante?

	DANTE spins, angrily.

				DANTE
		What?

	His expression softens.

				CAITLIN
		I'm not pregnant.

				DANTE
		Were you going to tell me or just

				CAITLIN
		I was going to tell you. But then
		we were getting along so well, I
		didn't want to mess it up.

				DANTE
		You could've broke it to me gently,
		you know; at least started by
		telling me you had a boyfriend. I
		told you I have a girlfriend.

				CAITLIN
		I know, I'm sorry. But when we

				DANTE
		So you're really getting married?

				CAITLIN
		No.

				DANTE
		No, you're not really getting
		married?

				CAITLIN
		The story goes like this: He
		proposed, and I told him I had to
		think about it, and he insisted I
		wear the ring anyway. Then my
		mother told the paper we were
		engaged.

				DANTE
		How like her.

				CAITLIN
		Then my mother called me this

		was in the paper. That's when I
		hopped the train to come back here,

		Thanks for the vote of confidence.

				CAITLIN
		Was I right?

				DANTE
		Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is

				DANTE
		But you were.

				CAITLIN
		No, I wasn't. Not really. I told
		you'd I'd been seeing other people.

				DANTE
		Yeah, but not seriously. Christ,
		you're ready to walk down the
		aisle-I'd say that constitutes
		something more than just seeing
		somebody.

				CAITLIN
		I'm giving him his ring back.

				DANTE
		What?

				CAITLIN
		I don't want to marry him. I don't
		want to get married now. I'm on the
		verge of graduation. I want to go
		to grad school after this. And then
		I want to start a career. I don't
		want to be a wife first, and then
		have to worry about when I'' going
		to fit in all of the other stuff.
		I've come way too far and studied
		too hard to let my education go to
		waste as a housewife. And I know
		that's what I'd become. Sang's
		already signed with a major firm,
		and he's going to be pulling a huge
		salary, which would give me no
		reason to work, and he's so
		traditional anyway...

				DANTE
		Sang? His name is a past tense?

				CAITLIN
		Stop it. He's a nice guy.

				DANTE
		If he's so nice, why aren't you
		going to marry him?

				CAITLIN
		I just told you.

				DANTE
		There's more, isn't there?

				CAITLIN
		Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?

				DANTE
		Tell me I don't have something to
		do with it.

				CAITLIN
		You don't have anything to do with
		it.

				DANTE
		You lie.

				CAITLIN
		Look how full of yourself you are.

				DANTE
		I just believe in giving credit
		where credit is due. And I believe
		that I'm the impetus behind your
		failure to wed.

				CAITLIN
		If I'm so nuts about you, then why
		am I having sex with an Asian
		design major?

				DANTE
		Jesus, you're caustic.

				CAITLIN
		I had to bring you down from that
		cloud you were floating on. When I
		say I don't want to get married, I
		mean just that. I don't want to
		marry anybody. Not for years.

				DANTE
		So who's asking? I don't want to
		marry you.

				CAITLIN
		Good. Stay in that frame of mind.

				DANTE
		Buy can we date?

									108.


				CAITLIN
		I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would

				DANTE
		We could introduce them. They might
		hit it off.

				CAITLIN
		You're serious. You want to date
		again.

				DANTE
		I would like to be your boyfriend,
		yes.

				CAITLIN
		It's just the shock of seeing me
		after three years. Believe me,
		you'll get over it.

				DANTE
		Give me a bit more credit. I think
		it's time we got back together, you
		know. I'm more mature, you're more
		mature, you're finishing college,
		I'm already in the job market...

				CAITLIN
		You work in a market, all right.

				DANTE
		Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to
		go out again. After all the talking
		we've been doing.

				CAITLIN
		The key word here is talk, Dante. I
		think the idea, the conception of
		us dating is more idyllic than what
		actually happens when we date.

				DANTE
		So...what? So we should just make
		pretend over the phone that we're
		dating?

				CAITLIN
		I don't know. Maybe we should just
		see what happens.

				DANTE
		Let me take you out tonight.

									109.


				CAITLIN
		You mean, on a date?

				DANTE
		Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie.

				CAITLIN
		The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie
		Date. I think I've been on that one
		before.

				DANTE
		You have a better suggestion?

				CAITLIN
		How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on
		the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked
		Somewhere Kind of Private Date?

				DANTE
		I hear that's a rather popular date.

				CAITLIN
			(hits him)
		Jerk. Here I am, throwing myself at
		you, succumbing to your wily
		charms, and you call me a slut, in
		so many words.

				DANTE
		What about Sing?

				CAITLIN
		Sang.

				DANTE
		Sang.

				CAITLIN
		He's not invited.

				DANTE
		He's your fiancé.

				CAITLIN
		I offer you my body and you offer
		me semantics? He's just a boyfriend,
		Dante, and in case you haven't
		gotten the drift of why I came all
		the way here from Ohio, I'm about
		to become single again.

									110.


				CAITLIN (CONT'D)
		And yes-let me placate your ego-you
		are the inspiration for this bold
		and momentous decision, for which
		I'll probably be ostracized at both
		school and home. You ask me who I
		choose, I choose you.

				DANTE
		So what are you saying?

				CAITLIN
		You're such an asshole.

				DANTE
		I'm just kidding.

				CAITLIN
		I can already tell this isn't going
		to work.

				DANTE
		I'll ask Randal to close up for me-
		when he gets back.

				CAITLIN
		Where'd he go? I'd have thought
		he'd be at your side, like an
		obedient lapdog.

				DANTE
		He went to rent a movie, but he
		hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw
		it; I'll just lock the store up and
		leave him a note.

				CAITLIN
		You're too responsible. But no. I
		have to go home first. They don't
		even know I left school. And I
		should break the disengagement news
		to my mother, which is going to
		cause quite a row, considering she
		loves Sang.

				DANTE
		Who doesn't?

				CAITLIN
		Well, me I guess.
			(gathering herself to go)
		So, I shall take my leave of you,
		but I will return in a little
		while, at which time-yes-I would
		love to go for dinner and a movie
		with you.

				DANTE
		What happened to the walk and the
		nakedness?

				CAITLIN
		I'm easy, but I'm not that easy.

		See you later, handsome.

		YES!

		I like to expand my horizons.

		I don't; you did.

		Really?

				DANTE
		Little girl. Maybe five years old?

				RANDAL

		Holy shit. That girl?

				DANTE
		As opposed to the hundreds of other

				RANDAL
		Then how come you got the fine?

		Because I'm here.

				RANDAL
		You're happy?

				DANTE
		I'm happy.

				RANDAL
		You're happy to get a fine?

				DANTE
		No. I'm happy because Caitlin came

				RANDAL
		Now I know you're lying.

				DANTE
		I'm not. She just left.

				RANDAL
		What did she say?

				DANTE
		She's not going to marry that guy.
		She went home to tell her mother.

				RANDAL
		You're kidding.

		I'm not.

				RANDAL

		Wow. You've had quite an evening.

				DANTE
		She went home, she's getting ready,

				RANDAL
		I feel so ineffectual. Is there
		anything I can do for you?

				DANTE
		Watch the store while I go home and

				DANTE
		This is my way of spitting water at

				RANDAL

		Hey, what about Veronica?

		No! Don't bring it up. I don't want

				RANDAL
		You're a snake.

				DANTE
		In my absence, try not to sell

				RANDAL
		You want me to bring the VCR over
		here so we can watch this?

				DANTE
		I might be leaving early to go out
		with Caitlin, in which case you'll
		have to close the store tonight.

				RANDAL
		All right, but you're missing out.
		Chicks with dicks.

				DANTE
			(puts cats on counter)
		I'll read the book.

	writes on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker.
	SILENT BOB hands him the scissors. JAY slowly cuts the large
	piece of paper. SILENT BOB hands him the tape. JAY snaps off
	a few pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store
	door. It is a large word balloon, and it reads I EAT COCK!
	Once in place, he raps on the window. RANDAL looks out, his

		Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian

				CAITLIN
		You saw that article? God, isn't it
		awful? My mother sent that in.

				RANDAL
		I take it she likes the guy.

				CAITLIN
		You'd think she was marrying him.
		What are you watching?

				RANDAL
		Children's programming. What did
		your mom say when you told her you
		weren't engaged anymore?

				CAITLIN
		She said not to come home until
		graduation.

				RANDAL
		Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante?

				CAITLIN
		What can I say? He does weird

				CAITLIN
		You can hold me down.

				RANDAL

				CAITLIN
		You might be let down. I'm not a

				RANDAL
		Few are. So what makes you think
		you can maintain a relationship
		with Dante this time around?

				CAITLIN
		A woman's intuition. Something in

		boy a serious try.

				RANDAL
		Wow. Hey, I was just about to order
		some dinner. You eat Chinese, right?

				CAITLIN
		Dick.

				RANDAL
		Exactly.

				CAITLIN
		So where is he?

				RANDAL
		He went home to change for the big

				CAITLIN
		God, isn't he great?

		No, this is great.

				CAITLIN
		Can I use the bathroom?

		There's no light back there.

		Why aren't there any lights?

				RANDAL
		Well, there are, but for some
		reason they stop working at five-
		fourteen every night.

				CAITLIN
		You're kidding.

				RANDAL
		Nobody can figure it out. And the
		boss doesn't want to pay the
		electrician to fix it, because the
		electrician owes money to the video

				CAITLIN
		Such a sordid state of affair.

				RANDAL
		And I'm caught in the middle-torn
		between my loyalty for the boss,
		and my desire to piss with the

				CAITLIN
		I'll try to manage.

	She heads toward the back.

				RANDAL
		Hey Caitlin...

		Break his heart again this time,

				CAITLIN
		You're very protective of him,
		Randal. You always have been.

		Territoriality. He was mine first.

		How'd you get here so fast?

		I left like an hour ago.

				DANTE
		Could be.

				CAITLIN

				CAITLIN
		When you just lie perfectly still

				DANTE
		Um...okay.

				RANDAL
		Am I missing something here?

				CAITLIN
		I went back there, and Dante was

				RANDAL
		He was?

				CAITLIN
		It was so cool. He didn't say a

		And we didn't kiss or talk or
		anything. He just sat there and let

		You dog! I didn't see you go back

		No. I place the time of death at

		Then how could she...you know...

				CORONER
		The body can maintain an erection
		after expiration. Sometimes for

		magazine when he came in?

				DANTE
		No. I gave it to him.

				DANTE
		Well he asked me for it!

				CORONER

		I can't say for certain until we

		don't hang out with drug dealers."

									131.


				DANTE
		Nothing personal.

	SILENT BOB hands weed to JAY.

				JAY
		I work, just like you. You're more
		of a crook than I am, dude.

				DANTE
		How do you figure...HEY! You can't
		roll a joint in here!

				JAY
			(rolling a joint)
		Relax brother. What I mean is that
		you sell the stuff in this store at
		the highest prices around. A dollar
		seventy-nine for wraps-what's that
		shit?

				DANTE
		It's not my store.

				JAY
		And these aren't my drugs-I just
		sell them.

				DANTE
		The difference is you exploit a
		weakness.

				JAY
		What's that mean?

				DANTE
		You sell to people that can't stay
		away from an addiction.

				JAY
		All right. How much is Pepsi here?

				DANTE
		A dollar sixty-nine, plus tax.

				JAY
		At Food City it's ninety-nine
		cents, plus tax.

				DANTE
		So.

									132.


				JAY
		So why do you sell it for so much
		more? I'll tell you why-because
		people come here and they're like
		"A dollar eighty for soda? I should
		get it at Food City. But I don't
		feel like driving there. I'll just
		buy it here so I don't have to
		drive up there." That's exploiting
		a weakness, too, isn't it?

				DANTE
		I can't believe you just rolled a
		joint in here.

				JAY
		Hey, man, what happened with that
		old guy?

				DANTE
		He died in the bathroom.

				JAY
		That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he
		was jerkin' off.

				DANTE
		I don't know. I wasn't watching.

				JAY
		Probably saw that Caitlin chick. I
		know I felt like beatin' it when I
		saw her.
			(pantomimes sex)
		Come here, bitch! You like this? Is
		this what you want? Hunhh?

				DANTE
		Knock it off. That used to be my
		girlfriend.

				JAY
		You used to go out with her?

				DANTE
		We were going to start again, I
		think.

				JAY
		Don't you already have a girlfriend?

				DANTE
		Veronica.

									133.


				JAY
		Is she that girl who's down here
		all the time? She came here today
		carrying a plate of food.

				DANTE
		Lasagne.

				JAY
		And what-you were gonna dump her to
		date that Caitlin chick?

				DANTE
		Maybe.

				JAY
		I don't know dude. That Caitlin
		chick's nice. But I see that
		Veronica girl doing shit for you
		all the time. She brings you food,
		she rubs your back...Didn't I see
		her change your tire one day?

				DANTE
		I jacked the car up. All she did
		was loosen the nuts and put the
		tire on.

				JAY
		Damn. She sure goes out of her way.

				DANTE
		She's my girlfriend.

				JAY
		I've had girlfriends, but all they
		wanted from me was weed and shit.
			(beat)
		Shit, my grandma used to say,
		"Which is better: a good plate with
		nothing on it..." No, wait. I
		fucked up. She said "What's a good-
		looking plate with nothing on it?"

				DANTE
		Meaning?

				JAY
		I don't know. She was senile and
		shit. Used to piss herself all the
		time. C'mon Silent Bob.

	Exit JAY. SILENT BOB stands there.

									134.


				SILENT BOB
		You know, there's a million fine-
		looking women in the world, but
		they don't all bring you lasagne at
		work. Most of them just cheat on you.

	SILENT BOB leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the
	bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in
	deep concentration. He suddenly snaps his eyes open.

				DANTE
			(nearly surprised)
		He's right. I love her.

						CUT TO:

	INT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

	RANDAL has a heart-to-heart with VERONICA.

				RANDAL
		So that's it. He doesn't love you
		anymore. He loves Caitlin.

	VERONICA stares, dumbfounded.

				VERONICA
		And...he told you all of this?

				RANDAL
		Pretty much. All except the latent
		homosexuality part-that's just my
		theory.

				VERONICA
		I...I don't know what to say.

				RANDAL
		Don't hold it against him. He just
		never got Caitlin out of his system.
		It's not your fault. It's Dante.
			(beat)
		I don't know thing one about chicks.
		Do you want to cry or something? I
		can leave.

				VERONICA
		I'm not sad.

				RANDAL
		You're not?

									135.


				VERONICA
		No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed
		off. I feel like he's been killing
		time while he tries to grow the
		balls to tell me how he really
		feels, and then he can't even do it!
		He has his friend do it for him!

				RANDAL
		He didn't ask me to...

				VERONICA
		After all that I've done for that
		fuck! And he wants to be with that
		slut? Fine! He can have his slut!

				RANDAL
		Um, do you think you can give me a
		lift home tonight?

				VERONICA
			(oblivious of RANDAL)
		I'm going to have a word with that
		asshole.

	VERONICA storms out.

				RANDAL
		Wait! Veronica...I don't think...

	RANDAL stares after her. A customer stands nearby.

				RANDAL
			(to customer)
		What am I worried about? He'll
		probably be glad I started the ball
		rolling. All he ever did was
		complain about her anyway. I'm just
		looking out for his best interests.
		I mean, that's what a friend does,
		am I right? I did him a favor.

				CUSTOMER
			(sees box on counter)
		Oooh! Navy Seals!

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

	DANTE is on the ground holding his knee. VERONICA stands
	above him.

									136.


				DANTE
		What the fuck did you do that for?

				VERONICA
		If you didn't want to go out with
		me anymore, why didn't you just say
		it? Instead, you pussyfoot around
		and see that slut behind my back!

				DANTE
		What're you talking about?

				VERONICA
			(kicks him)
		You've been talking to her on the
		phone for weeks!

				DANTE
		It was only a few times...

				VERONICA
		And then you pull that shit this
		morning, freaking out because I've
		gone down on a couple guys!

				DANTE
		A couple...?

				VERONICA
			(throws purse at him)
		I'm not the one trying to patch
		things up with my ex, sneaking
		around behind your back! And if you
		think that thirty-seven dicks are a
		lot, then just wait, mister: I'm
		going to put the hookers in Times
		Square to shame with all the guys I
		go down on now!

				DANTE
		Would you let me explain...

				VERONICA
		Explain what? How you were waiting
		until the time was right, and then
		you were going to dump me for her?

				DANTE
			(getting up)
		Veronica...I...it's not like that
		anymore...I mean, it was never
		really like that...

									137.


	VERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down,
	yelling in pain.

				VERONICA
		You're damn right it's not like
		that! Because I won't let it be
		like that! You want your slut? Fine!
		The slut is yours!

				DANTE
		I don't want Caitlin...

				VERONICA
		You don't know what you want, but
		I'm not going to sit here anymore
		holding your hand until you figure
		it out! I've encouraged you to get
		out of this fucking dump and go
		back to school, to take charge of
		your life and find direction. I
		even transferred so maybe you would
		be more inclined to go back to
		college if I was with you. Everyone
		said it was a stupid move, but I
		didn't care because I loved you and
		wanted to see you pull yourself out
		of this senseless funk you've been
		in since that whore dumped you, oh
		so many years ago. And now you want
		to go back to her so she can fuck
		you over some more?

				DANTE
		I don't want to go back with her...

				VERONICA
		Of course not; not now! You're
		caught, and now you're trying to
		snake out of doing what you wanted
		to do. Well, I won't let you. I
		want you to follow through on this,
		just so you can find out what a
		fucking idiot you are. And when she
		dumps you again-and she will,
		Dante, I promise you that-when she
		dumps you again, I want to laugh at
		you, right in your face, just so
		you realize that that was what you
		gave up our relationship for!
			(grabs her purse)
		I'm just glad Randal had the balls
		to tell me, since you couldn't.

									138.


				DANTE
			(weakly)
		Randal...?

				VERONICA
		And having him tell me...that was
		just the weakest move ever. You're
		spineless.

				DANTE
		Veronica, I love you...

				VERONICA
		Fuck you.

	VERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone.

						CUT TO:

	EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

	RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him.

						CUT TO:

	INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

	Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside.

				RANDAL
		Dante?

	Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame.
	DANTE throttles RANDAL, choking him to the ground. RANDAL
	throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back
	into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE
	comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as
	Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs
	a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the
	opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. DANTE leaps at
	his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin
	over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face.
	DANTE paws at his eyes. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and
	smacks it into DANTE'S face as he rushes him blindly. DANTE
	chases him out of the frame. M&M's scatter wildly across the
	empty floor, and the ruckus is heard O.C.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE and RANDAL later, out of breath, on the floor. RANDAL
	sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck. DANTE lies
	on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies,
	ripped-open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods.

									139.


				RANDAL
		How's your eye?

				DANTE
			(reluctantly)
		The swelling's not so bad. But the
		FDS stings.
			(then)
		How's your neck?

				RANDAL
		It's hard to swallow.

	They are both silent. Then...

				RANDAL
		You didn't have to choke me.

				DANTE
		Why the fuck did you tell Veronica
		that I was going to dump her for
		Caitlin?

				RANDAL
		I thought I was doing you a favor.

				DANTE
		Thanks.

				RANDAL
		You were saying how you couldn't
		initiate change yourself, so I
		figured I'd help you out.

				DANTE
		Jesus.

	Silence. Then...

				RANDAL
		You still didn't have to choke me.

				DANTE
		Oh please! I'm surprised I didn't
		kill you.

				RANDAL
		Why do you say that?

				DANTE
		Why do I say that? Randal...forget
		it.

									140.


				RANDAL
		No, really. What did I do that was
		so wrong?

				DANTE
		What don't you do? Randal, sometimes
		it seems like the only reason you
		come to work is to make my life
		miserable.

				RANDAL
		How do you figure?

				DANTE
		What time did you get to work today?

				RANDAL
		Like ten after.

				DANTE
		You were over half an hour late.
		Then all you do is come over here.

				RANDAL
		To talk to you.

				DANTE
		Which means the video store is
		ostensibly closed.

				RANDAL
		It's not like I'm miles away.

				DANTE
		Unless you're out renting videos at
		other video stores.

				RANDAL
		Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we
		could watch it together!

				DANTE
		You get my slapped with a fine, you
		fight with the customers and I have
		to patch everything up. You get us
		chased out of a funeral by violating
		a corpse. To top it all off, you
		ruin my relationship. What's your
		encore? Do you anally rape my
		mother while pouring sugar in my
		gas tank?
				(MORE)

									141.


				DANTE (CONT'D)
			(sighs)
		You know what the real tragedy is?
		I'm not even supposed to be here
		today!

				RANDAL
			(suddenly outraged)
		Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to
		you trying to pass the buck again.
		I'm the source of all your misery.
		Who closed the store to play hockey?
		Who closed the store to attend a
		wake? Who tried to win back an ex-
		girlfriend without even discussing
		how he felt with his present one?
		You wanna blame somebody, blame
		yourself.
			(beat, as DANTE)
		"I'm not even supposed to be here
		today."
			(whips stuff at DANTE)
		You sound like an asshole. Whose
		choice was it to be here today?
		Nobody twisted your arm. You're
		here today of your own violation,
		my friend. But you'd like to
		believe that the weight of the
		world rests on your shoulders-that
		the store would crumble if Dante
		wasn't here. Well, I got news for
		you, jerk: This store would survive
		without you. Without me either. All
		you do is overcompensate for having
		what's basically a monkey's job:
		You push fucking buttons. Any moron
		can waltz in here and do our jobs,
		but you're obsessed with making it
		seem so much more fucking important,
		so much more epic than it really is.
		You work in a convenience store,
		Dante. And badly, I might add. And
		I work in a shitty video store.
		Badly, as well.
			(beat)
		You know, that guy Jay's got it
		right-he has no delusions about
		what he does. Us? We like to make
		ourselves seem so much better than
		the people that come in here, just
		looking to pick up a paper or-God
		forbid-cigarettes. We look down on
		them, as it we're so advanced.
		Well, if we're so fucking advanced,
		then what are we doing working here?

									142.


	RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong
	words alone.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.

						CUT TO:

	DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.

				RANDAL
		I threw out the stuff that got
		broken. The floor looks clean.

				DANTE
		You need a ride?

				RANDAL
			(looks out door)
		Got one. Just pulled up.

	They stand in silence. Then...

				DANTE
		Do you work tomorrow?

				RANDAL
		Same time. What about you?

				DANTE
		I'm calling out. Going to hit the
		hospital-see how Caitlin is. Then
		try to see Veronica.

				RANDAL
		You wanna grab something to eat
		tomorrow night...after I get out of
		here?

				DANTE
		I'll call you. Let you know.

				RANDAL
		All right. Good luck with Veronica.
		If you want, I can talk to her, you
		know, and explain...

				DANTE
		No thanks. I'll take care of it.
		We've got a lot of shit to talk
		about.

									143.


				RANDAL
		Helluva day.

				DANTE
		To say the least.

				RANDAL
		Do you need a hug or something?
		'Cause I would have no hang-ups
		about hugging you...you know, you
		being a guy and all. Just don't
		knead my ass when you do it.

				DANTE
		Get the fuck outta here already.

				RANDAL
		I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.

	RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE
	the sheet-sign.

				RANDAL
		You're closed.

	He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

	DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open
	and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

	POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

				DANTE
		What'd you forget something?
			(looks up, surprised)
		Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.

	A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.
	He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

	JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on
	the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs
	a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of
	change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the
	frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

	CREDITS

	Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes
	to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for
	a clerk, looks down the aisles.

				CUSTOMER
		Hello? Little help?

									144.


	No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to
	make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the
	counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.

 OK, so here it is. The entire script to Clueless including important actions, songs from the soundtrack, and my own personal comments. Just hit the little speaker  next to the character's name to hear the lines from the movie (They're not working yet). I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it. It's amazing the things you pick up when watching a scene 50 times. One thing: this is written by a hopelessly devoted and loyal Alicia Silverstone fan, so some of the commentary may be biased. But, I figure if you're reading this then you must have some interest her. Enjoy.

 Any suggestions, errors, anything?! Please email me pacey578@rocketmail.com

   

 SCENE I - CHER'S HOUSE

 "Kids in America" The Muffs

 (Heaps of shots of the girls having fun)

 CHER V.O.

 So OK, you're probably thinking, "Is this, like a Noxema commercial, or what?!" But seriously, I actually have a way normal life for a teenage girl. I mean I get up, I brush my teeth, and I pick out my school clothes.


 "Fashion Girl" David Bowie

 Daddy's a litigator. Those are the scariest kinds of lawyers. Even Lucy, our maid, is terrified of him. He's so good he gets paid five hundred dollars an hour just to fight with people, but he fights with me for free 'cause I'm his daughter.


 CHER

 Daddy!


 MEL

 Cher, please don't start with the juice again.


 CHER

 Daddy, you need your vitamin C.


 MEL

 Where's my briefcase?


 CHER

 It's been a couple of months now, so I say we go out to Malibu.


 MEL

 Don't tell me those braindead low-lifes have been calling again.


 CHER

 They are your parents. And don't try sneaking out of the office. Dr. Lovitz is coming by to give you a flu shot.


 MEL

 Oh, Josh is in town. He's coming for dinner.


 CHER

 Why?


 MEL

 Because he's your step-brother!


 CHER

 But you were hardly even married to his mother and that was five years ago. Why do I have to see Josh?


 (Watch those LIPS!!)

 MEL

 You divorce wives, not children.


 CHER

 Here.


 MEL

 Forget it!


 SCENE II - CHER'S CAR

 "Just a girl" No Doubt

 CHER V.O.

 Did I show you the loqued-out Jeep Daddy got me? It's got four wheel drive, dual side airbags and monster sound system. I don't have a licence yet, but I need something to learn on.


 (Cher runs over a potted plant on the kerb)

 Oh, why that came out of nowhere.


 (Watch her face when she looks back at the road)

 Here's where Dionne lives. She's my friend because we both know what it's like to have people be jealous of us.


 DIONNE

 Dude!


 CHER

 Girlfriend!


 CHER V.O.

 And I must give her snaps for her courageous fashion efforts.


 DIONNE

 Hey Cher.


 CHER V.O. 

 Dionne and I were both named after great singers of the past who now do infomercials.


 DIONNE

 So?


 CHER

 Shopping with Dr. Seuss?


 DIONNE

 Well, at least I wouldn't skin a Collie to make my backpack.


 CHER

 It's Faux.


 DIONNE

 Hello. That was a stop sign!


 CHER

 I totally paused!


 DIONNE

 Yeah, OK.


 SCENE III - SCHOOL WALKWAY

 DIONNE

 It's not even eight thirty and Murray is paging me.


 CHER

 He is so possesive.


 DIONNE

 Tell me about it. This weekend he called me up and he's all "Where were you today?" and I'm like "I'm at my Grandmother's house"...


 CHER V.O.

 Dionne and her boyfriend, Murray are in this dramatic relationship. I think they've seen that Ike and Tina Turner movie just too many times. Now I have to say to her...


 CHER

 Dee, why do you put up with it? You could do so much better.


 DIONNE

 Alright, sh, sh. Here he comes.


 "Shoop" Salt n' Pepa

 MURRAY

 Woman, why don't you be answering any of my pages?


 DIONNE

 I hate when you call me Woman!


 MURRAY

 Where you been all weekend? What's up? You been jeepin' around behind my back?


 DIONNE

 Jeepin'?


 CHER

 Jeepin'.


 (Watch Cher closely. It's Classic!)

 MURRAY

 Jeepin', jeepin'.


 DIONNE

 No, but speaking of vehicular sex, perhaps you can explain to me how this cheap K-mart hair extension got into the back seat of your car.


 MURRAY

 I don't know where that came from. That looks like one of your stringy something on others you got up here...


 DIONNE

 Excuse me. I do not wear polyester hair, OK. Unlike some people I know, like Shawanna.


 CHER

 Dee, I'm outie.


 DIONNE

 Bye.


 MURRAY

 Why do you gotta go there?


 DIONNE

 That's it. I've had it with you.


 MURRAY

 Is it that time of the month again?


 (Croud Gasps)

 CHER V.O.

 I don't know why Dionne is going out with a high school boy. They're like dogs. You have to clean them and feed them and they're just like these nervous creatures that jump and slobber all over you.


 (Random guy puts his arm around Cher)

 CHER 

 Ooo! Get off of me! Uh, AS IF!


 SCENE IV - CLASSROOM DEBATE

 MR HALL

 Should all oppressed people be allowed refuge in America? Amber will take the con position. Cher will be pro. Cher, two minutes.


 CHER 

 So, OK, like right now, for example, the Haitians need to come to America. But some people are all "What about the strain on our resources?" But it's like, when I had this garden party for my father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner. But people came that like, did not R.S.V.P. so I was like, totally buggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squish in extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the more the merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrange some things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion, may I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue of Liberty?


 (Class breaks into applause)

 CHER

 Thank you very much.


 MR HALL

 Uh, Amber? Replying?


 AMBER

 Mr. Hall, how can I answer that? The topic is Haiti and she's talking about some little party.


 CHER

 Hello?! It was his fiftieth birthday!


 AMBER

 Whatever. If she doesn't do the assignment, I can't do mine.


 MR HALL

 Ladies. So, does anyone have any further thoughts on Cher's oration? Elton? Comments?


 ELTON

 Yeah, I can't find my Cranberries CD. I've gotta do to the Quad before somebody snags it.


 MR HALL

 I'm afraid I can't permit that. Any further insights?


 TRAVIS

 I had an insight, Mr. Hall.


 MR HALL

 I'm all ears.


 TRAVIS

 OK, like, the way I feel about the Rolling Stones is the way my kids are going to feel about Nine Inch Nails, so I really shouldn't torment my Mom anymore, huh?


 MR HALL

 Yes. Well, it's a little off the subject of Haiti, but tolerance is always a good lesson, even when it comes out of nowhere.


 TRAVIS

 Thank you.


 MR HALL

 And with that in mind, I'm going to distribute you report cards. Now, is there a Christian Stobich in this class?


 CHER

 MR. Hall? The buzz on Christian is that his parents have joint custody, so he'll be spending one semester in Chicago and one semester here. I think it is a travesty on the part of the legal profession.


 (Look at Cher's face while speaking! Ahhh, I can't take it anymore!)

 MR HALL

 Thank you for that perspective Cher.


 (Mr. Hall hands out the report cards)

 Now could all conversations please come to a halt.


 (Travis jumps up to the window)

 And could the suicide attempts please be postponed till the next period?


 TRAVIS

 Must die.


 (After Cher, the most classic character in the movie)

 CHER V.O.

 Suddenly, a dark cloud settled over first period. I got a C in debate?!


 SCENE V - SCHOOL HALLWAY

 CHER (on phone)

 Dee?


 DIONNE

 Wassup?


 CHER

 Did you get your report card?


 DIONNE

 Yeah, I'm toast. How'd you do?


 CHER

 I totally choked. My father is going to go ballistic on me.


 DIONNE

 Mr. Hall was way harsh!


 (Cher and Dionne meet up in the hall)

 He gave me a C minus.


 CHER

 Well, he gave me a C, which drags down my entire average.


 DIONNE

 Bye.


 CHER

 I'll call ya, OK?


 DIONNE

 Yeah.


 SCENE VI - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 Isn't my house classic? The columns date all the way back to 1972. Wasn't my Mom a betty? She died when I was just a baby. A fluke accident during a routine liposuction. I don't remember her, but I like to pretend she still watches over me.


 CHER

 Hey, Ma. 98 in geometry. Pretty groovy, huh?


 "Fake Plastic Trees (Acoustic Version)" Radiohead

 CHER V.O. 

 Yuk! Uh, the maudlin music of the University station.


 CHER

 Waa, waa, waa.


 (Cher enters the kitchen)

 Yuh, what is it about college and cry-baby music?


 JOSH

 Hey, who's watching the Galleria?


 CHER 

 So, the flannel shirt deal. Is that a nod to the crispy Seattle weather, or are you just trying to stay warm in front of the refrigerator?


 JOSH (grabs Cher's tummy)

 Oo, wow. You're filling out there.


 CHER

 Wow. Your face is catching up with your mouth.


 JOSH

 I went by Dad's office.


 CHER

 He is not your Dad. Why don't you torture a new family.


 JOSH

 Hey, just because my mother marries someone else, doesn't mean he's my father.


 CHER

 Actually, Kato, that's exactly what it means.


 (They enter the Lounge)

 I hope you're not thinking of staying here.


 JOSH

 I sure want to.


 CHER

 I'm sure you do.


 JOSH

 I've got a place in Westwood, near School.


 CHER

 Shouldn't you go to school on the East Coast? I hear girls at N.Y.U. aren't at all particular.


 JOSH

 Hahaha, you're funny.


 (Josh changes the channel from Beavis and Butthead to the News)

 CHER

 Hey! God, you just got here and already you're playing couch Commando!


 JOSH

 Hey! In some parts of the Universe, maybe not in Contempo Casual, but in some parts, it's considered cool to know what's going on in the world.


 CHER

 Thank you, Josh. I so need lessons from you on how to be cool. Tell me that part about Kenny G again?


 MEL (From Dining Room)

 C'mon you chuckleheads, get in here!


 (They move to the Dining Room)

 Josh, are you still growing? You look taller than you did at Easter.


 JOSH

 I don't think so.


 MEL (to Cher)

 Doesn't he look bigger?


 CHER

 His head does.


 MEL

 So, Josh, have you given any thought to our little discussion about Corporate Law?


 JOSH

 Yeah, you know, but I think I'd really like to check out Environmental Law.


 MEL

 What for? Do you want to have a miserable, frustrating life?


 CHER

 Oh, Josh will have that no matter what he does.


 MEL 

 At least he knows what he's doing. And he's in good college. I'd like to see you have a little bit of direction.


 CHER

 I have direction.


 JOSH

 Yeah, towards the mall.


 MEL

 Which reminds me, where's your report card?


 CHER

 It's not ready yet.


 MEL

 What do you mean, "it's not ready yet?"


 CHER

 Well, some teachers are trying to low-ball me, Daddy. And I know how you say, "Never accept a first offer", so I figure these grades are just a jumping off point to start negotiations.


 MEL

 Very good.


 (One of the mobile phones rings, everyone answers their phone)

 CHER

 Dee?


 JOSH

 Yeah?


 MEL

 Hello? Yeah, Jake, what? NO! Not the afternoon.


 (Cher and Josh put their phones down)

 CHER

 You are such a brown-noser.


 JOSH

 Oh, and you are such a superficial space-cadet. What makes you think you can get teachers to change your grades?


 MEL (in background)

 I told you I wanted it in the morning! Doesn't he understand? In the morning.


 CHER

 Only the fact that I've done it every other semester.


 SCENE VII - VARIOUS SCHOOL LOCALES

 "Shake some action" Cracker

 CHER V.O.

 I told my P.E. teaher an evil male had broken my heart, so she raised my C to a B.


 CHER

 I'm so miserable. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't study.


 MISS STOEGER

 They're slime, they're slime, I mean they're horrible, don't feel bad, don't feel bad, I know, and you see they're all like this.


 CHER V.O.

 Then I promised Miss Giest I'd start a letter writing campaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act.


 But Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debates were unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing, AS IF!


 I felt impotent and out of control, which I really hate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my thoughts and regain my strength.


 SCENE VIII - THE MALL

 DIONNE

 Dude, what's wrong? Are you suffering from buyer's remorse or something?


 (Watch Cher flick her head)

 CHER

 God, no! Nothing like that. It's just that, we've been shopping all day and I still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall. I have tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude, but I was brutally rebuffed.


 DIONNE

 Get over it, OK. He's a miserable little man who wants to make everyone else miserable too.


 CHER

 Dee, that's it! We've got to figure out a way to make Mr. Hall sublimely happy.


 SCENE IX - SCHOOL

 CHER V.O.

 Here's the four-one-one on Mr. Hall. He's single, he's 47, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job. What that man needs is a good healthy boinkfest. Unfortunately, there was a major babe drought in our school. The evil trolls from the math department were actually married,... oooh Snickers... and in the grand tradition of P.E. teachers, Ms. Stoeger seemed to be same-sex oriented. Of course, there was always Miss Giest. Something told me not to discount Miss Giest. Well sure, she has runs in her stockings, and her slip is always showing, and she always has more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth. God, this woman is screaming for a make-over. I'm her only hope.


 (Cher is writing a note outside Miss Giest's pidgeon hole)

 DIONNE

 Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May but thy eternal summer shall not fade. Phat! Did you write that?


 CHER

 Duh, it's like a famous quote.


 DIONNE

 From where?


 CHER

 Cliff's notes.


 DIONNE

 Oh.


 (Travis and Miss Giest walk out of her office toward where Cher and Dionne have split the scene)

 MISS GIEST

 I know you're going to be better now. Now, you run along and I'll see you third period and you will try to remember to bring your textbook.


 TRAVIS

 Uh, OK.


 (Miss Giest reads the note left by the girls and her face brightens)

 DIONNE

 Oh, my God! She actually looked happy!


 CHER

 Oooh, classic!


 (Scene changes to Mr. Hall's classroom)

 MR HALL

 Paroudasm Budapshawn, 16 tardies to work off.


 (Paroudasm mutters something in Farsi and his friends cheer)

 Janet Huon, no tardies.


 CLASSMATES

 Kisser!


 MR HALL

 Travis Berkenstock, 38 tardies. By far the most tardies in the class. Congratulations.


 (The whole class cheers and applaudes. Travis approaches the podium)

 TRAVIS 

 This is so unexpected, I, uh, I didn't even have a speech prepared. Uh, but I would like to say this: Tardiness is not something you can do all on your own. Many, many people contributed to my tardiness. Uh, I'd like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school, the L.A. city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid, and, uh, last but not least, the wonderful crew at McDonalds for spending hours making those egg McMuffins, without which I might never be tardy.


 MR HALL 

 Well, if Mr. Berkenstock has no political messages to include in his speech, I'll go on. Cher Horowitz, two tardies.


 CHER

 I object! Do you recall the dates of these alleged tardies?


 (Cher in lawyer mode. Legendary!)

 MR HALL

 One was last Monday!


 CHER

 Mr. Hall, I was surfing the crimson wave, I had to haul ass to the ladies'.


 MR HALL

 I assume your referring to women's troubles, and so I'll let that one slide.


 CHER

 Thank you, Mr. Hall. Miss Giest was right about you.


 MR HALL

 What do you mean?


 CHER

 Well, she said that you were the only one in this school with any intelligence.


 SCENE X - CHER'S HOUSE

 MEL

 Cher, get in here!


 CHER

 Yes, Daddy?


 MEL

 Would you tell me what the hell this is?


 CHER

 Um, a second notice for three outstanding tickets. I don't remember getting a first notice.


 MEL

 The ticket is the first notice. I didn't even know you could get tickets without a licence.


 CHER

 Oh, sure you can. You can get tickets anytime.


 MEL

 Oh, is that so?


 (Cher nods)

 Well not around here you can't. From this moment on, you will not drive, sit, do anything in that jeep without a supervised driver present. And no cruisin' around with Dionne, alright? Two permits do not equal a licence! Do I make myself clear?


 CHER

 Yes, Daddy.


 MEL

 Cher, I expect you to become a good driver. I want to see you apply yourself.


 CHER

 I will. I'm gonna practise real hard.


 MEL

 OK. 

 (The scene moves to the poolside)

 CHER V.O. 

 A licenced driver with nothing to do? Where would I find such a loser?


 CHER

 Hey, granola breath, you got something on your chin.


 JOSH

 I'm growing a goatee.


 CHER

 Oh, that's good. You don't want to be the last one at the coffee house without chin pubes.


 JOSH

 I can't tell you how much I enjoy these little chats of ours, but in the interest of saving time, why don't you just tell me what you want.


 CHER

 OK. So, actually, I have a permit and I can drive and all, but Daddy says I can't take the jeep out without a licenced driver, and since your not doing anything and all, you know?


 JOSH

 What are the chances of you shutting up until you get your way?


 CHER

 Hmmm, slim to none. C'mon!


 SCENE XI - CHER'S CAR

 JOSH

 Hey, James Bond, in America we drive on the right side of the road.


 CHER

 I am. You try driving in platforms.


 JOSH 

 Look, I got to get back to school. Ah, you want to practise parking?


 CHER

 What's the point? Everywhere you go has valet. What class you going to?


 JOSH

 Actually, I'm going to a tree people meeting. Me might get Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.


 CHER

 How fabulous. Getting Marky Mark to take time from his busy pants-dropping schedule to plant trees? Josh, why don't you just hire a gardener?


 JOSH

 You know, maybe Marky Mark wants to use his popularity for a good cause, make a contribution. In case you have never heard of that, a contribution is the giving of...


 CHER

 Excuse me, but I have donated many expensive Italian outfits to Lucy...


 JOSH

 time... funds...


 CHER

 And as soon as I get my licence I fully intend to brake for animals, and I have contributed many hours helping two lonely teachers find romance.


 JOSH 

 Which I'll bet serves your interest more than theirs. You know, if I ever saw you do something that wasn't ninety percent selfish, I'd die of shock.


 CHER

 Oh, that'd be reason enough for me.


 SCENE XII - SCHOOL

 CHER

 Would you call me selfish?


 DIONNE

 No. Not to your face.


 CHER

 Really?


 DIONNE

 What's wrong? Is Josh giving you shit because he's going through his post-adolescent idealistic phase?


 CHER

 Look, there's Mr. Hall.


 (The girls run over to Mr. Hall)

 Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall, um, do you drink coffee?


 MR HALL

 Well, not from this cafeteria. But, uh, yes under normal circumstances.


 CHER

 Well, I am such a retard. When I was packing Daddy's lunch this morning I gave him my lemon snapple, and I took his sucky Italian roast. Do you want it?


 MR HALL

 Are you sure you don't want it?


 CHER

 Duh, it might stunt my growth. I wanna be 5'10" like Cindy Crawford. But I thought maybe you and Miss Giest might like it?


 DIONNE

 Maybe you can share it?


 MR HALL

 Well, uh, thanks.


 CHER

 Sure.


 (To Dionne)

 Hmm?


 (Outside Miss Giest's office, she opens the door)

 CHER & DIONNE

 Miss Giest!


 MISS GIEST

 Hi girls. Did you sign up for the environmental fair?


 DIONNE

 Oh, yeah, we will.


 CHER

 You have such pretty eyes. Don't hide them. And these clips are so cute.


 DIONNE

 And this tiny little waist. Oooh, wow.


 MISS GIEST

 Girls. Oh, and don't forget to sign up for the environmental fair.


 DIONNE

 Not a total betty, but a vast improvement.


 CHER

 Well, we did our best. 


 DIONNE

 Mmmm, Hmmm.


 CHER

 We gotta book it if we're going to make it to P.E.


 (Scene moves outside)

 C'mon, Dee.


 DIONNE

 Ohh, I feel like failing, dude, c'mon.


 CHER

 I know what you mean, but at least it's exercise. I feel like such a heffer. I had two bowls of special K, three pieces of turkey bacon, a handful of popcorn, five peanut butter M&M's, and like, three pieces of licorice.


 DIONNE

 (Gasp) Oh, my God. Look. Is that a photo op, or what?


 CHER

 Will you look at that body language? Legs crossed towards each other. That's an unequivocal sex invite.


 DIONNE

 Oh, Cher, he's getting her digits. Look at Giest, she is so cute.


 CHER

 Ohh, old people can be so sweet.


 "Change" Lightning Seeds

 (The following scenes show Miss Giest and Mr. Hall get it on while everyone is thanking Cher.)


 CHER V.O.

 The entire student body was utterly grateful for the improvement in their grades.


 SCENE XIII - CHER'S HOUSE

 MEL

 Cher, what's this all about?


 CHER

 My report card?


 MEL

 The same semester?


 CHER

 Uh-huh.


 MEL

 What'd you do? Turn in some extra-credit reports?


 CHER

 No.


 MEL

 You take the mid-terms over?


 CHER

 Uh-uh.


 MEL 

 You mean to tell me that you argued your way from a C+ to an A-?


 CHER

 Totally based on my powers of persuasion. You proud?


 MEL

 Honey, I couldn't be happier than if they were based on real grades.


 CHER

 Thank you.


 MEL

 Fabulous.


 SCENE XIV - SCHOOL P.E.

 "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" Robert Hazard

 CHER V.O.

 I felt so satisfied, I wanted to do more good deeds.


 (Dionne sneezes)

 CHER

 Dee, when your allergies act up, take out your nose-ring.


 MISS STOEGER

 Follow... through! There you go, there you go. All right, Cher. Earth to Cher! Come in Cher!


 CHER

 Oh. Miss Stoeger? I would just like to say that physical education in this school is a disgrace. I mean, standing in line for forty minutes is hardly aerobically effective. I doubt I've worked off the calories in a stick of care-free gum.


 (Class cheers)

 MISS STOEGER

 Well, you certainly exercised your mouth Cher. Now, hit the ball.


 (Ball flies by, inches from Cher's nose)

 CHER

 Miss Stoeger, that machine is just a lawsuit waiting to happen!


 MISS STOEGER 

 Thanks for the legal advice.


 (Cher returns to line)

 Dionne? You're up.


 DIONNE

 Uh, no, Miss Stoeger? I have a note from my tennis instructor, and he would prefer it if I didn't expose myself to any training that might derail his teachings.


 MISS STOEGER

 Fine! Amber?


 AMBER

 Miss Stoeger. My plastic surgeon doesn't want me doing any activity where balls fly at my nose.


 DIONNE

 Well, there goes your social life.


 (Girls giggle. Principal walks onto the scene)

 PRINCIPAL

 Miss Stoeger? Got another one. Ladies, we have a new student with us. This is Tai Frasier.


 MISS STOEGER

 Tai, you don't have time to change, but you could hit a few balls in those clothes.


 AMBER

 She could be a farmer in those clothes.


 CHER

 Dee, my mission is clear. Would you look at that girl? She is so adorably clueless. We have got to adopt her.


 DIONNE

 Cher, she is toe-up. Our stock would plummet.


 CHER

 Dee, don't you want to use your popularity for a good cause?


 DIONNE

 No.


 CHER

 (Motions to Tai)

 C'mere. Yeah, c'mere. Hang with us.


 TAI

 Oh, thank you.


 CHER

 How do you like California?


 TAI

 Man, I am freakin'. I could really use some sort of a herbal refreshment?


 DIONNE

 Well, we do lunch in ten minutes. We don't have any tea, but we have Coke and stuff.


 TAI

 No shit! You guys got Coke here?


 DIONNE

 Well, yeah.


 CHER

 Yeah, this is America.


 (Scene changes to the girls walking down main path)

 "Unknown song and artist"

 CHER V.O.

 So, we decided to show Tai the ropes at Bronson Alcott High School.


 CHER

 That is Alana's group over there. They do the T.V. station. They think that's the most important thing on Earth. And that's the Persian mafia. You can't hang with them unless you own a BMW. And there's Elton in the white vest, and all the most popular boys in the school.


 DIONNE

 Including my boyfriend. Ain't he cute?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHER

 If you make the decision to date a high school boy, they are the only acceptable ones.


 TAI

 Cher, which one of them is your boyfriend?


 CHER

 As if!


 DIONNE

 Cher's got attitude about high school boys.


 CHER

 It's a personal choice every woman has got to make for herself.


 (Murray approaches the girls)

 MURRAY (to Dionne) 

 Woman, lend me five dollars.


 DIONNE

 Murray, I have asked you repeatedly not to call me Woman!


 MURRAY

 Excuse me, Miss Dionne. 


 DIONNE

 Thank you.


 MURRAY 

 OK, but street slang is an increasingly valid form of expression. Most of the feminine pronouns do have mocking, but not necessarily in a misogynistic undertone.


 (Murray hops away)

 TAI

 Wow! You guys talk like grown-ups.


 CHER

 Oh, well, this is a really good school.


 TAI

 I'm gonna go get a soda. You guys want?


 CHER

 Sure.


 TAI

 Alright.


 DIONNE

 She's nice.


 CHER

 Oooh, project!


 (I can't put that cute little squeal into words)

 (Scene changes to inside cafeteria)

 "My Iron Lung" Radiohead

 TRAVIS (To food)

 Oh, wow. That's disgusting.


 (To Tai)

 That's nice representation.


 TAI

 Thanks. Those are really nice stickers.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, you like 'em? See, I was thinking it was too cluttered. You know, I wanna wipe all of this out and concentrate on one main decorative statement. Like, uh, Marvin the Martian. Right there.


 TAI

 Get outa town! I can do Marvin the Martian.


 TRAVIS

 Really?


 TAI

 Well, I mean, there's not really a lot to him. But, you wanna see?


 TRAVIS

 Yeah.


 TAI

 Here.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, wow! That's really cool.


 TAI

 Thanks.


 TRAVIS

 You drew that?


 TAI

 Yeah, and wait, I got... one here.


 TRAVIS

 You didn't trace this?


 TAI

 Uh-uh. No. Here's another one over here. And, lots of little guys. 


 TRAVIS

 That is so cute! 


 TAI

 I love to draw.


 TRAVIS

 You're really good at it.


 TAI

 No.


 TRAVIS

 Yeah, really you are.


 TAI

 No.


 TRAVIS

 Yeah!


 (Scene changes to outside)

 DIONNE

 Are you sure that's fat free?


 CHER

 Oh, yes. And you lose wait by doing it like this. Like really small.


 (Dionne giggles/hisses)

 It's true.


 TAI

 I met a really cool guy.


 CHER

 Describe!


 TAI

 Alright, he's got long hair, he's really funny, and straight off, right? He offers me some smoke. There he is!


 CHER

 Are you talking about drugs?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHER

 Tai, how old are you?


 TAI

 I'll be sixteen in May.


 CHER

 My birthday is in April, and as someone older, can I please give you some advice?


 (Tai nods)

 It is one thing to spark up a dubie and get laced at parties, but it is quite another to be fried all day.


 DIONNE

 Do you see the distinction?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHER

 Loadies generally hang on the grassy knoll over there.


 "unknown song and artist" guitarish

 Sometimes they come to class and say bonehead things, and we all laugh, of course. But no respectable girl actually dates them. 


 DIONNE

 Hmm-mm.


 CHER 

 You don't want to start off on the wrong foot, do you?????????????


 (TAI shakes her head)

 I've got an idea. Let's do a make-over!


 (Dionne lights up)

 TAI

 No, no.


 DIONNE

 Oh, c'mon! Let us! Cher's main thrill in life is a make-over. OK, it gives her a sense of control on a world full of chaos.


 CHER

 Pleeeaaase.


 (How could anyone resist that?!)

 TAI

 Sure. Why not? Shit! You guys! I have never had straight friends before.


  


 SCENE XV - MAKE-OVER AT CHER'S HOUSE

 "Supermodel" Jill Sobule

 (Various scenes of Cher and Dionne making over Tai, then Cher and Tai working out in the lounge room)

 CHER

 Squeeze in.


 TAI

 Cher, I don't wanna do this any more, and my buns, they don't feel nothin' like steel.


 CHER

 OK, it will get easier, I promise. Just as long as we do it every day. Not just sporadically.


 TAI

 How do you know if we're doing it sporadically?


 CHER

 That's another thing, Tai. We've got to work on your accent and vocabulary. See, sporadic means once in a while. Try and use it in a sentence today.


 TAI

 Alright.


 CHER

 OK, from now on we're alternating Cindy Crawford's "Aerobicise" and "Buns of Steel", and reading one non-school book a week. My first book is "Fit or Fat".


 TAI

 Mine is "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".


 CHER

 Good. Now that takes care of our minds and bodies, but we should do something good for mankind or the planet for a couple of hours.


 (Josh walks in)

 JOSH

 Hey, brainiac.


 CHER

 Uh, the dreaded ex. Tai, this is Josh.


 JOSH

 Nice to meet ya.


 CHER 

 Hey! You know about this stuff. I want to do something good for humanity.


 JOSH

 How about sterilization?


 (Tai cracks up. Cher and Josh enter the kitchen)

 CHER

 So, what do ya think?


 JOSH

 I'm amazed.


 CHER

 That I'm devoting myself so generously to someone else?


 JOSH

 No, that you've found someone even more clueless than you are to worship you.


 CHER

 I am rescuing her from teenage hell. Do you know the wounds from adolescence can take years to heal?


 JOSH

 Yeah, and you've never had a mother so you're acting out on that poor girl as if she was your Barbie doll.


 CHER

 Freshman psych rears it's ugly head


 JOSH

 Hey, I am not taking psych.


 CHER

 Whatever. I am going to take that lost soul in there and make her well-dressed and popular. Her life will be better because of me. How many girls can say that about you?


 (Josh and Cher walk back to the lounge where Tai is watching T.V. and singing along with the "Mentos" ad. God I hate those ads!)

 JOSH

 Be seein' ya.


 TAI

 Yeah, I hope not sporadically.


 SCENE XVI - SCHOOL

 CHER

 Oh, my God. Do you see how boys are responding? My heart is totally bursting.


 DIONNE

 I know. I'm kvelling!

 (Travis approaches)


 TRAVIS

 Cher, you have Timor, right?


 CHER

 Giest.


 TRAVIS

 Hey, Tai! Did you get a flyer?


 TAI

 Uh-uh.


 TRAVIS

 Here.


 TAI

 Thanks. Wow, a party!


 CHER

 It's in the Valley. The cops usually break 'em up in less than an hour, and it takes that long to get there.


 DIONNE

 And besides, it's just local loadies.


 TAI

 Do you guys think that Travis is gonna be there?


 DIONNE

 Tai, I thought we moved on from there.


 CHER

 Don't sell yourself short now. You've got something going for you that no one in this school has.


 TAI

 Oh, I'm not a virgin.


 CHER

 I mean mystery. As far as everyone is concerned you were the most popular girl in your school, and the fact that you hang with Dee and I, well...


 DIONNE

 Speaks very highly of you.


 CHER

 If you strike while the iron is hot, you can have any guy that you want.


 TAI

 Like who?


 CHER

 Let's see. Who's available? There's Bronson... I got it! Elton! He just broke up with Collette.


 DIONNE

 Oh, yes!


 TAI

 Who's Elton?


 DIONNE

 Oh, my God. He's way popular. He's like the social director of the crew.


 CHER

 Yeah, and his Dad can get you into any concert, and I noticed him scoping you out.


 TAI

 He was looking at me?


 CHER

 He said you gave him a toothache.


 TAI

 How'd I do that?


 CHER

 It's an expression. It means he thought you were sweet.


 TAI

 Yeah?


 CHER

 Yeah.


 TAI

 Wow.


 DIONNE

 Is that true?


 CHER

 No.


 DIONNE

 Oh, you are so bad.


 (Scene moves to fountain where Cher is taking pictures of the crew)

 "Alright" Supergrass

 CHER

 Ok, you guys, all get together. Oh, that is great. Smile! Tai, Tai, get a little closer. Closer Tai. Good, great! Hey, Elton, uh, why don't you put your arm around Tai?


 ELTON

 (Unwillingly) Alright!


 CHER

 Yeah, that's great.


 (Check out Cher's little smile and rock! Awesome!)

 OK. Tai, c'mere, c'mere, Tai.


 (Scene moves to just Cher and Tai by bushes)

 Hold that.


 TAI

 OK. 

 CHER

 OK. 

 (Elton approaches.)

 ELTON

 Cool picture.


 CHER

 Doesn't she look classic?


 ELTON

 Yeah, this is beautiful.


 CHER

 She looks like one of those Bottichellis chicks.


 ELTON

 Hey, why don't you make me a copy of this, OK?


 CHER

 Sure.


 (Another one of Cher's little squeals. Classic!)

 SCENE XVII - CHER'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM

 CHER

 Hi Daddy. This is my friend, Tai.


 MEL

 Get out of my chair!


 (Tai moves to opposite Cher. Lucy brings in dinner.)

 CHER

 Thank you, Lucy. It looks great.


 MEL

 What is this crap?


 CHER

 Daddy, it's from the "Cut your Colesterol" cook book. Doctor Lovitz says you've got to get down to two hundred.


 (Cher's pager beeps.)

 MEL

 No calls tonight.


 CHER

 But it's Dionne, it might...


 MEL

 Sorry!


 CHER

 It might be important.


 MEL 

 We're going to have a nice family dinner. So, uh, what'd you do at school today?


 CHER

 Well... I broke in my purple clogs.


 (Mel's phone rings.)

 MEL

 Yeah, hello? Alright, Jake. Yeah, yeah, no, no, what?


 CHER

 Dee? Whatup?


 DIONNE

 So, check it. Murray's geometry class is right by Elton's locker, and taped up inside was the picture you took of Tai.


 CHER

 Oh, my God.


 TAI

 What?


 CHER

 Elton's got a picture of you hanging up in his locker.


 TAI

 Oh, no shit!


 DIONNE 

 Hello! So, anyway, the whole crew is going to this party in the Valley.


 CHER

 Bye. 


 (Cher hangs up the phone.)

 Looks like we're going to have to make a cameo at the Val party.


 MEL (in background)

 I told you I want it in the morning. No!


 SCENE XVIII - MURRAY'S CAR

 DIONNE

 Murray!


 MURRAY

 Just look at the top of the map. Sun Valley is north.


 DIONNE

 OK, no. All I see is Bel Air, OK. 

 MURRAY

 Then you're on the wrong map. 

 DIONNE

 I am not on the wrong map.


 MURRAY

 Look at the number on the top. What is the number on the top?


 DIONNE

 There are no numbers on the top. There's letters.


 (Murray makes a frustrated noise.)

 DIONNE

 Murray, shut up!


 CHER

 Please don't friz out!


 SCENE XIX - THE VAL PARTY

 (The gang pull up outside the party.)

 Listen Tai, when we get there make sure Elton sees you, but don't say hi first. Look like you're having fun and you're really popular. Talk to someone in his eyeline, preferably a guy. Make him come to you, and find an excuse to leave while he's still into the conversation. The key is, always have him wanting more. You got it?


 TAI

 I got it.


 CHER

 OK. 

 TRAVIS

 Heads up!


 (Does a rail slide with his skateboard on the stair-rail.)

 TAI

 Oh, did you just see that?!


 CHER

 Oh, God. Skateboards, that is like, so five years ago.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, you guys came! That's great! You want a beer? I'll get you one.


 CHER (to Tai)

 No.


 (The girls enter the party house.)

 "Unknown song and artist"

 TAI

 This is ragin'.


 CHER

 Let's do a lap before we commit to a location.


 (Dionne drags a dancing girl away from Murray.)

 DIONNE

 Who was that?!


 TAI

 Cher, ain't that the same dress that you was wearin' yesterday?


 CHER

 Say, Ambular?


 AMBER

 Hi.


 CHER

 Was that you going through my laundry?


 AMBER

 As if. Like I would really wear something from Judy's.


 CHER

 Do you prefer fashion victim or ensembly challenged?


 (Amber walks off.)

 AMBER

 Uh!


 CHER

 What a clone.


 TAI

 Cher, you looked much better in that dress than she did.


 (Travis bursts onto the scene spilling drink on Cher's shoes.)

 CHER

 Uh! Ruin my satin shoes, why don't you?!


 TRAVIS

 I'm sorry.


 (They move to the kitchen.)

 CHER

 Excuse me, my shoes! Uh! This is so not fixable.


 TRAVIS

 It's a small price to pay to the party gods. Look, I'll make amends. How about some chronic shit?


 CHER

 Oh, it's the least you could do.


 TAI

 Spark it.


 CHER

 Hey, Elton's over there. Act like Travis is saying something funny.


 (Tai hands joint to Cher and blows smoke in her face.)

 TAI

 Sorry.


 (Tai starts cracking up.)

 TRAVIS

 What's so funny?


 TAI

 Nothing.


 (Elton approaches and reaches behind Cher for the joint)

 CHER

 Oh, here.


 (Summer enters holding a card)

 SUMMER

 Hey, everyone! Let's play suck and blow.


 (The card passes through the group until Elton drops it (on purpose) and plants one right on Cher's mouth)

 CHER

 God, Elton. Can you suck?


 (Dionne screams in the background)

 It's Dee. C'mon!


 (Scene changes to the bathroom, where Murray is getting his head shaved)

 DIONNE

 What have you done! Oh, my God! Uh! Why did you do this to your head?!


 MURRAY

 Because I'm keeping it real. Because I'm keeping it real.


 DIONNE

 What?!


 MURRAY

 'Cause I'm keeping it... 'cause I'm keeping it real.


 DIONNE (to Cher)

 Look! Look what he's done to his head! Can you believe this?


 MURRAY

 Look at Lawrence's head. Alright?


 LAWRENCE

 It's the bomb!


 MURRAY

 You know what I'm sayin'? You look good.


 LAWRENCE

 As will you.


 DIONNE

 What'd you care what he thinks, Murray? I'm the one that has to look at you. That was a big mistake. What am I going to do with you now? And right before the year book pictures? What am I going to tell my grandchildren?


 MURRAY

 Alright.


 DIONNE

 You know what? Ok, that's it.


 MURRAY (mimicking)

 That's it.


 DIONNE

 You wanna play games?


 MURRAY (mimicking agin)

 You wanna play games?


 DIONNE

 I'm calling your mother.


 MURRAY

 I'm... I'm ca... Oh, wait! Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, wait. Don't call my Ma.


 LAWRENCE

 Yo, man. Chill, chill!


 MURRAY

 Chill?!


 (Cher and Tai start walking away)

 CHER

 Same thing happened at the spring dance. She spent the entire after-party in the bathroom.


 TAI

 See, that almost destroyed by buzz.


 CHER

 I'm still baked.


 TAI

 Yeah.


 (Back to the dance floor.)

 "Rollin' With My Homies" Coolio

 CHER

 What do ya say, we go bump into people?


 TAI

 Yeah, I'm cool with that.


 TRAVIS (from on the fireplace)

 Hey, Tai! Wait up! Whooh!


 (Travis jumps onto the crowd. No one keeps him up and he hits the deck.)

 TAI

 Are you OK?


 TRAVIS (to dancers)

 Where's your sense of pit hospitality?


 TAI

 That was so cool, the way you did that. I wish I could do it.


 TRAVIS

 Oh, no, don't.


 TAI

 Why not?


 TRAVIS

 Well, 'cause if girls did it, what would guys do to impress them?


 TAI

 I don't know, like stuff. You know?


 TRAVIS

 What kind of stuff?


 (Cher spots Travis tuning Tai and butts in to stop it)

 CHER

 Tai, I need you.


 TAI

 OK. 

 CHER

 Elton's over there.


 (The girls start dancing. As Tai is trying to impress Elton she is hit in the head by a flying Clog)

 CHER

 Tai! Tai, Elton, help me!


 (Elton carries Tai into the kitchen and places her on the counter)

 CHER

 Thank you.


 TRAVIS

 Here, you should use ice.


 CHER

 No, Travis! We've got it under control. 


 TRAVIS

 Tai, are you OK?


 CHER

 Travis, Tai would have wanted you to enjoy the party.


 CHER 

 If it's a concussion, you have to keep her concious, OK? Ask her questions.


 ELTON

 What's seven times seven?


 CHER

 Stuff she knows!


 (Tai sits up and hits her head on the light. What a clutz!)

 ELTON

 Some bump you've got there.


 TAI

 Yeah.


 ELTON

 Yeah? You ready to go back out there?


 TAI

 Yeah, I am.


 ELTON

 Alright. Are you sure? Can you do this? (Singing) Rollin' with the homies.


 TAI

 (Singing) Rollin' with the homies. 


 (Great voice.)

 ELTON

 Yeah, let's do it. You're ready.


 (Elton and Tai go back to the dance floor.)

 CHER V.O.

 I had to give myself snaps for all the good deeds I was doing. It was so great. Love was everywhere. Even though I was alone, I was really happy for Tai. It's like that book I read in ninth grade that said, "'tis a far, far better thing doing stuff for other people."


 (Scene changed to outside by the pool. Cher's phone rings.)

 CHER 

 Hello?


 MEL

 Do you know what time it is?


 CHER

 A watch really doesn't go with this outfit, Daddy.


 MEL

 Where are you?


 CHER

 Uuhh, just having a snack with my girlfriends.


 MEL

 Where, in Kuwait?!


 CHER

 Is that in the Valley?


 MEL

 Cher, I expect you to walk in this door in twenty minutes.


 CHER

 Well, um, it might take longer than that, Dad.


 MEL

 Everywhere in L.A. takes twenty minutes.


 (Cher hangs up the phone.)

 (Scene changes to outside front of party house.)

 CHER

 Sorry to make you leave, Dionne is bucking for best dramatic actress at a Val party.


 (Tai laughs.)

 CHER

 Hey, Summer!


 SUMMER

 Hi! Pretty random fiesta. Need a ride home?


 CHER

 That'd be great! Thanks!


 ELTON

 No, I got it.


 SUMMER

 Well, I'm right below Wilshire and Lindon.


 TAI

 Oh, that's right near me! I'm, um, above Olympic.


 ELTON

 Great! Then, Tai you'll go with Summer, and Cher you'll come with me.


 CHER

 Actually, you could take Wilshire to Cannon and that turns into Bennedict.


 ELTON

 Well, then she'd have to go back south and I'm already going north.


 CHER

 But, you could take Tai on your way up to Sunset. Yeah.


 ELTON

 That doesn't make any sense! I'd have to get off the freeway, I hate that. Tai, go with Summer, Cher, you'll come with me. Watch your feet.


 (Each get into respective cars and wave each other goodbye.)

 SCENE XX - ELTON'S CAR

 "Away" The Cranberries

 (Elton is singing along to music. Trying to be sexy, but he fails miserably, the sleazy bastard!)

 CHER

 Didn't Tai look cute tonight?


 (Elton just sings.)

 I really love her hair when it's all wild, you know? But it's also very pretty when it's all up, with that curly tendrils. Like in that picture I took.


 ELTON

 You know, you're one of my best friends and I do not have friends that are girls.


 CHER

 Well, I'm glad, because your happiness means a lot to me.


 ELTON

 It does?


 CHER

 Sure. I mean, I saw how hard your breakup with Collette was.


 ELTON

 Yeah. I think we both know what it feels like to be lonely.


 CHER

 Whatever. The thing is, is that I'd really like to see you settled already.


 (Elton pulls the car into a parking lot.)

 Where are we going?


 (The car stops.)

 ELTON

 I knew it, I knew it.


 (Elton makes a pass at Cher.)

 CHER

 Oooh, you knew what?!


 ELTON

 That you were totally sprung on me.


 CHER

 Hello?! Don't you mean Tai?


 ELTON

 Tai?!


 CHER

 You have her picture in your locker.


 ELTON

 I have the picture you took in my locker.


 CHER

 Ohh, I'm having a twin peaks experience.


 ELTON

 I knew it, I knew it when you kissed me.


 CHER

 Suck and Blow is a game, Elton!


 (Elton has another go at Cher.)

 Stop it!


 ELTON

 Alright! You know, I don't get you Cher. I mean, you flirt with me all year.


 CHER

 As if! I have been tryng to get you together with Tai.


 ELTON

 Tai?! Why would I go with Tai?


 CHER

 Why not?


 ELTON

 Why not? Why not?! Don't you even know who my father is?


 CHER

 You are snob and a half.


 ELTON

 Cher, listen to me. Me and Tai, I mean, we don't make any sense, right? Me and you, well, makes sense.


 (Elton tries for Cher, yet again.)

 CHER

 Cut it out!


 ELTON

 C'mon.


 CHER

 Stop it!


 (Cher gets out of the car.)

 (Watch Cher compose herself after getting out of the car. i.e. the head movements and sound effects.)

 ELTON

 Cher?! Where are you going? You're only hurting yourself here, baby. C'mon, you gonna walk home? Would you get back in the car, please? Get back in the car.


 CHER

 Leave me alone!


 ELTON

 Fine!


 (Elton drives away. What a prick!)

 CHER

 Hey, where are you going? Shit!


 (Cher whips out the phone and dials)

 OPERATOR

 Valley information.


 CHER

 Yeah, do you have the number of a cab company?


 OPERATOR

 Which one?


 CHER

 I don't know which one. What do you have out here?


 OPERATOR

 We have Valley Cabs...


 ROBBER

 Hand it over.


 (Cher squeals/moans)

 Give me the phone.


 (Cher complies)

 OK. Bag, too. C'mon! Alright, now, uh, get down on the ground. Face down. C'mon!


 CHER

 Oh, no. You don't understand, this is an Alaia.


 ROBBER

 An a-what-a?


 CHER

 It's like a totally important designer.


 ROBBER

 And I will totally shoot you in the head. Get down!


 (Cher whimpers as she lies down on the pavement)

 Alright, um, count to a hundred. Thank you.


 CHER

 One, two...


 CHER V.O.

 The evening had turned into a royal mess. Sexually harrassed, robbed. I didn't know the number of the party, so I couldn't call Dionne, and Daddy would kill me if he knew where I was. There was just one person left to call, and I really, really didn't want to call him.


 (Cher dials up Josh's place. He's trying to get it on with his girlfriend)

 JOSH

 C'mon.


 (Phone rings)

 Hello.


 CHER

 Josh, you busy?


 HEATHER

 Who is it?


 JOSH

 It's Mel's daughter.


 CHER

 So, OK, I was at this party, and my designated driver tried to attack me, so I got out 'cause we'd stopped, and then he drove off and deserted me, and then this guy with a gun held me up, took my money, and my phone and he yelled at me and he forced me to ruin my dress.


 JOSH

 OK, OK, look, um. Where are you?


 CHER

 Sun Valley.


 JOSH

 Man, you owe me.


 SCENE XXI - JOSH'S CAR

 "The Ghost in You" Counting Crows

 HEATHER

 The man is ridiculous. He doesn't have one unique thought in his little, puny brain.


 JOSH

 I think there's some merit in learning the form straight off.

 SCENE XXIV - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 Suddenly, Daddy had a case that had to be solved right away, so some clerks and Josh came to help him go through a gazillion depositions.


 (The doorbell rings)

 CHER (from upstairs)

 Daddy!


 MEL

 What?


 CHER

 I can't just open it, I have to make him wait a while.


 MEL

 Then he can wait outside.


 CHER

 Josh, pleeeaaase!


 (Who could resist that?!)

 C'mon, Josh? C'mon.


 (Josh opens the door. Christian walks right in)

 CHRISTIAN

 What do ya hear?


 JOSH

 She's not ready.


 (The two of them walk over to where Mel is working)

 CHRISTIAN

 Hey, man.


 (Christian extends his hand, but Mel ignores it)

 Nice pile of bricks you got here.


 MEL

 You drink?


 CHRISTIAN

 No, thanks. I'm cool.


 MEL

 I'm not offering, I'm asking you if you drink? You think I'd give alcohol to teenage drivers taking my daughter out?


 CHRISTIAN

 Hey, man. The protective vibe, I dig.


 MEL

 What's with you kid? You think the death of Sammy Davis left an opening in the Rat Pack?


 (Cher appears walking down the stairs. Josh and every male in the audience is stunned)

 CHER

 Christian.


 CHRISTIAN

 Doll face.


 CHER

 Handsome.


 CHRISTIAN

 Stunning.


 JOSH (to Mel)

 You're not letting her go out like that, are ya?


 MEL

 Cher, get in here.


 CHER

 What's up, Daddy?


 MEL

 What the hell is that?


 CHER

 A dress.


 MEL

 Says who?


 CHER

 Calvin Klein.


 MEL

 It looks like underwear. Go upstairs and put something over it.


 CHER

 Duh, I was just going to.


 (Cher runs off)

 MEL 

 Hey, you?!


 (Christian turns around)

 Anything happens to my daughter, I got a .45 and shovel. I doubt anybody would miss you.


 (Cher reappears)

 CHER

 Bye, Daddy. C'mon!


 (They walk out)

 CHER

 It's so killer!


 CHRISTIAN

 Thank you. Your dad is pretty scary.


 CHER

 Isn't he?


 CHRISTIAN

 You like Billie Holiday?


 CHER

 I love him.


 CHRISTIAN

 Right.


 "Miss Brown To You" Billie Holiday

 (They drive off)

 JOSH

 I didn't like him.


 MEL

 What's to like?


 JOSH

 I think I should go to the party.


 MEL

 If you feel like you should go...


 JOSH

 You don't need me, do ya?


 MEL

 No, no, no.


 JOSH

 I mean, unless you want? I mean, unless you want?


 MEL

 Josh! Go to the party. Go, go, go, go.


 JOSH

 OK. I'll watch her for you.


 (Josh walks off)

 MEL

 You do that.


 SCENE XXV - THE FRAT PARTY

 "Someday I Suppose" Mighty Mighty Bosstones

 (Everyone is just dancing. Tai enters)

 CHER

 Tai!


 (Tai falls down the stairs on her butt! Classic!)

 Oh, my God. Tai, are you OK?


 TAI

 God, shit! That is so embarassing!


 CHER

 No, no one saw.


 TAI

 Now, all night long, I'm gonna be known as that girl who fell on her butt.


 CHER

 Tai, no one noticed.


 "Where'd You Go?" Mighty Mighty Bosstones

 COLLEGE GUY

 Wow! Are you OK? That looked really bad.


 TAI

 Yeah, thanks.


 (Tai spots Elton dancing with Amber.)

 Oh, my God, Cher, look. He's going with Amber?!


 CHER

 No, he's probably just dancing with her.


 TAI

 Do you think she's pretty?


 CHER

 No, she's a full on Monet.


 TAI

 What's a monet?


 CHER

 It's like a painting, see? From far away, it's OK, but up close, it's a big old mess. Let's ask a guy. Christian, what do you think of Amber?


 CHRISTIAN

 Hagsville.


 CHER

 See?


 CHRISTIAN

 Dig this. They're charging for brewskies. Cash me a five, I'll pay you back.


 CHER

 Sure.


 (Christian kisses Cher on the cheek)

 CHRISTIAN

 Thanks.


 (Christian walks away)

 TAI

 He is so cute!


 CHER

 Oh, my God. Do you see how he is falling in love with me?


 (The girls watch Christian shrug off an interested girl)

 I mean, look how he ignores every other girl.


 TAI

 Oh, God, look. There's Josh.


 CHER V.O.

 I didn't even see him come in, but it's like he finds the only adult in here, like he's deliberately trying to not have fun.


 (Watch the look on Cher's face as she's waving. Truly legend.)

 TAI

 Cher, I have a question. What do you think I should do with this thing? Should I, uh, like tie it around, or put it over my shoulder?


 CHER

 Tie it around your waist.


 CHRISTIAN

 Ready to slide?


 TAI

 Thanks.


 CHRISTIAN

 Let's go.


 (Christian and Cher return to the dance floor)

 CHER V.O.

 The band was kickin', and Christian was the hottest guy there, but my enjoyment was put on pause when I saw how unhappy Tai was.


 (Josh walks over to Tai, engages in small talk, then asks her to dance)

 CHER

 Oh, look, look! Josh is dancing with Tai, he never dances.


 CHRISTIAN

 I can see why.


 CHER

 No, he's doing her a prop so she won't feel left out.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, I dig it.


 (Time passes. Cher, Tai, Josh, and Christian are left. Christian is still dancing by himself)

 "Here (Squirmel Mix)" Luscious Jackson

 JOSH

 How are you guys holding up?


 CHER

 We're so ready to leave.


 TAI

 I'm tired.


 CHER

 Let's get Christian and go. Christian! You wanna go?


 CHRISTIAN

 Now? These guys here have got the skinny on the happenin' after hours.


 CHER

 My trainer's coming really, really early this morning.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh.


 JOSH

 Look, I could take the girls home.


 CHRISTIAN

 No, it's OK.


 CHER

 No, I'm fine, stay.


 CHRISTIAN

 You sure?


 CHER

 Yeah, sure.


 CHRISTIAN (to Josh)

 Thanks, man. You got my marker.


 (to Cher) You are a down girl. I'll call you tomorrow.

 SCENE XXVI - JOSH'S CAR

 CHER

 That was really decent of you to dance with Tai tonight.


 JOSH

 My pleasure.


 CHER

 You notice any positive changes in her?


 JOSH

 Yeah, it's under your tutilage she's exploring the challenging world of bare midriffs. So you didn't want to make a night of it with the ring-a-ding kid?


 CHER

 Yeah, Daddy wouldn't go too ballistic, it's not like he's going to sleep or anything.


 JOSH

 No, not if they're going to finish those depo's.


 CHER

 Hey, you what would be so dope? If we got some really delicious take-out. I bet they haven't eaten all night.


 JOSH

 That would be pretty dope of us. Let's do it.


 SCENE XXVII - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 The midnight snack totally revived the lawyers and Daddy was way grateful.


 MEL

 Mmm, Meat!


 CHER

 Meaty oranges and you get a lot of vitamin C.


 (Mel picks up a large sandwich)

 Daddy, no! Daddy, no. You know you can't have that...


 MEL

 Cher, c'mon!


 CHER

 Don't be silly.


 CHER V.O.

 I know it sounds mental, but sometimes I have more fun vegging out than when I go partying. Maybe because my party clothes are so binding.


 JOSH

 Look, I'm just curious. How many hours a day do you spend grooming yourself?


 CHER

 Some people are not lucky enough to be as naturally adorable as you are.


 JOSH

 Stop it, you're making me blush.


 (Phone rings. Cher answers)

 CHER

 Hello?


 GAIL

 Hi Cher, how are you?


 CHER

 Hi, Gail.


 GAIL

 Is my son there, cleaning out your refridgerator?


 (Josh motions a "No" to Cher)

 CHER

 No, no, he's not here. You should try the dorms.


 GAIL

 Alright, bye, hon.


 CHER

 Bye-bye.


 (Cher hangs up the phone)

 What was that all about?


 JOSH

 She wants me to come home for spring break.


 CHER

 So, what's the big deal? Nobody will be in school.


 JOSH

 Yeah, but husband number four's at home and his whole idea of acting like a family is to criticize me.


 CHER

 So, what? You're just going to roam around campus for two weeks all by yourself?


 JOSH

 I don't mind.


 CHER

 That is stupid. Why don't you just come here, you can have your old room, and there are going to be some great parties.


 JOSH

 I don't know.


 CHER

 Why not?


 JOSH

 You got your whole social world going on, I don't want to get in the way.


 CHER

 you won't be in the way.


 JOSH

 How much fun would it be having a brother-type tagging along?


 CHER

 Josh, you are not my brother.


 JOSH

 You know what I mean.


 CHER

 C'mon, you need some excitement in your life. It'll replenish you for your finals.


 JOSH

 OK. 

 CHER

 Good.


 JOSH

 I can't believe I'm taking advice from someone who watches cartoons.


 CHER 

 That's Ren and Stimpy. They're way existential.


 JOSH

 Do you have any idea what you're talking about?


 CHER

 No, why? Do I sound like I do?


 SCENE XXVIII - CHER'S HOUSE

 (Theme from "2001:A Space Odyssey" is playing while camera is focused on phone. The phone rings)

 CHER V.O.

 Christian said he'd call the next day, but in boy time, that meant Thursday. So, you can imagine my astonishment to hear from him while I was packing Daddy up.


 CHER

 Hello?


 "I Believe I'm You" Gail Orange

 CHER V.O.

 He said he'd come over with some video tapes and we'd watch them. A night alone with Christian! I sent for reinforcements. Then, Dee and I had to design a lighting concept, and costume decisions. I don't rely on mirrors, so I always take polaroids. Whenever a boy comes, you should always have something baking.


 CHER

 Oh, I'm still all red.


 DIONNE

 Well, I'm trying to make you as white as I can, Cher. Look, you're all flushed. You have to calm down. OK? Calm.


 CHER

 You know, I am so glad I never did it with someone I had lukewarm feelings for. Christian is brutally hot, and I am going to remember tonight forever.


 DIONNE

 Blot.


 (Later)

 (The door bell rings. Cher opens the door)

 CHRISTIAN

 Hi.


 CHER

 Hi.


 CHRISTIAN

 Is something burning?


 CHER

 Oh, my God!


 (Cher runs to the kitchen. The bake was fried)

 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, honey, you baked.


 CHER

 I tried.


 CHRISTIAN

 C'mon, show me the rest of your pad.


 (Cher and Christian are outside among Mel's art collection)

 CHRISTIAN

 Your father has a well-rounded collection.


 CHER

 Daddy says it's a good investment.


 CHRISTIAN

 He's absolutely right. Klaus Oldenberg.


 CHER

 Oh, he's way famous!


 (Christian approaches a different sculpture)

 CHRISTIAN

 This is older, see? Transitional. A very important piece.


 CHER

 Um, do you want to go swimming?


 CHRISTIAN

 Hmmm, let's watch the movies.


 CHER

 Oh, OK.


 (Scene moves to Christian and Cher lying on bed watching "Spartacus")

 CHER V.O.

 Christian had a thing for Tony Curtis, so he brought over "Some Like It Hot" and "Sparaticus".


 (Cher starts rubbing her feet up against Christian's legs. Christian doesn't enjoy it)

 CHER

 My feet are cold.


 (Christian puts a pillow over Cher's feet)

 Thanks.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, watch this part, this is good.


 (Cher falls off the bed while trying to look sexy. Too funny.)

 Are you OK?


 CHER

 I'm fine. Do you want some, something to drink? You know, I could get you some wine.


 CHRISTIAN

 No. You notice how wine makes people wanna feel, like sexy.


 CHER

 That's OK.


 CHRISTIAN

 I'm actually getting tired.


 CHER

 But, um, I could make you some coffee if you'd like?


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, no thanks. Got the ulcer.


 CHER

 But you had all those cappucinos before?


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh. Well, you know, that was, like... foam.


 (They move to the front door)

 You're great. We're friends, right?


 (Cher nods)

 Knock me a little kiss.


 (Cher kisses him on the cheek)

 I'll see ya.


 (Christian leaves)

 CHER V.O.

 I don't get it. Did my hair get flat? Did I stumble into some bad lighting? What's wrong with me?


 (NOTHING!)

 SCENE XXIX - MURRAY'S CAR

 DIONNE

 Nothing! Maybe he really was tired!


 CHER 

 I suppose it wasn't meant to be, I mean, he does dress better than I do. What would I bring to the relationship?


 MURRAY

 Get back into the right lane. What's the first thing you do?


 DIONNE

 First thing I do is, I put on my blinker.


 (Dionne accidently turns the wipers on)

 Oh, wait, shit.


 MURRAY

 Watch the road, watch the road!


 DIONNE

 Alright! Stop. Then, I look in my mirror. OK, then I glance at my blind spot.


 MURRAY

 Glance with your head, not the whole car. I swear to God, I swear to God, Woman, you can't drive for shit!


 DIONNE

 I'm not trying to hear that.


 MURRAY

 Hear me...


 CHER

 Actually, going all the way is like a really big decision. I can't believe I was so caprecious about it. Dee, I almost had sex with him.


 MURRAY

 You almost had sex with who?


 CHER

 Christian.


 (Murray cracks up)

 DIONNE

 What?


 MURRAY 

 Yo, look. Are you bitches blind or something? Your man, Christian is a cake-boy!


 CHER & DIONNE

 A what?!


 MURRAY

 He's a disco-dancing, Oscar Wilde-reading, Streissand ticket-holding friend of Dorothy, know what I'm saying?


 CHER

 Uh-uh. no way.


 MURRAY

 He's gay.


 CHER

 Not even.


 MURRAY

 Yes, even.


 DIONNE

 He does like to shop, Cher, and the boy can dress.


 CHER

 Oh, my God. I am totally buggin'. I feel like such a bonehead.


 MURRAY

 What the hell? Yo, you're getting on the freeway!


 DIONNE

 What?!


 MURRAY

 Yo, turn right! Get out of the lane! Don't go. Forget procedure, just get out of the lane!


 (Both Cher and Dionne scream)

 MURRAY

 Truck, truck, truck, truck! Ahhh!


 CHER (screaming)

 You're on the freeway!


 DIONNE

 What do I do, Murray?


 MURRAY

 Go straight, go straight, go straight! Just relax and drive, baby! Just relax and drive.


 (An old lady gives them the finger)

 CHER (screaming)

 Shut up! Shut up!


 (Lots of screams from everybody)

 MURRAY

 Whatever you do, keep your hands on the wheel, at all times!


 (A huge truck closes in on them. Murray sees it)

 Aaahhhhh!!!


 (A lot more screaming from the three)

 Turn to the right! Oh, there it is. Alright, we're off. Damn, you did wonderful. Sorry, baby.


 CHER

 You did it, Dee!


 MURRAY

 Relax, relax, relax, relax, honey, relax. Baby, relax, relax. Breathe, breathe, breath in, breathe. Let it out. Breathe, breathe, breathe, honey, breathe, breath. Relax, relax.


 CHER V.O.

 Boy, getting off the freeway makes you realize how important love is. After that, Dionne's virginity went from technical to non-exisistant. I realized how much I wanted a boyfriend of my own.


 SCENE XXX - THE MALL

 CHER V.O.

 Not that Christian wasn't a blast to hang out with. He was becoming one of my favourite shopping partners.


 CHRISTIAN

 ???????? Um, where's Tai?


 CHER

 Oh, she met some random guys at the Foot Locker and escorted them right over there.


 TAI (in distance)

 Oh, my God! Did you see...


 CHER

 I don't know where she meets these Barnies.


 CHRISTIAN

 I have a question, alright?


 CHER

 What?


 CHRISTIAN

 The jacket? Is it James Dean or Jason Priestly?


 CHER

 Carpe' diem. OK, you looked hot in it.


 CHRISTIAN

 Really?


 TAI (with the barnies)

 If I fall, would you guys catch me?


 CHER

 Could we please be more... generic?


 (Tai screams)

 TAI

 Stop it! Please! Bring me back up, please! Bring me back up.


 (Tai screams a little more, then Christian rescues her)

 TAI

 Thank you.


 CHRISTIAN

 You asshole!


 BARNEY #1

 Hey, man. We're just joking.


 CHRISTIAN

 Oh, really?! Someone could get killed.


 (Tai runs over and hugs Cher)

 TAI

 Cher, you don't understand. I was just sitting there and I was just talking to those guys, and then, all of a sudden, we were laughing, and...


 CHRISTIAN

 Hey, are you OK?


 TAI

 Yeah.


 CHRISTIAN

 Are you sure?


 TAI

 I'm fine. Yeah, uh-huh.


 CHRISTIAN

 Let's get you home for some R&R, huh?


 TAI

 What's that?


 (Christian laughs)

 CHER V.O.

 Boy, considering how clueless she was, Tai certainly had that "damsel in distress" act down.


 SCENE XXXI - SCHOOL

 CHER V.O.

 Meanwhile, back at school, everyone was talking about Tai's "brush with death" at the mall.


 STUDENT

 Was it, like a montage of all the scenes in your life?


 TAI

 Not exactly a montage...


 SUMMER

 Hey, Cher! Is it true some gang members, like tried to shoot Tai in the mall?


 CHER

 No.


 SUMMER

 That is what everyone is saying.


 CHER

 Whatever.


 STUDENT

 When I was nine, I fell off the jungle gym, that's when I saw this light, you know?


 TAI

 Wait, wait. Move down for Cher.


 DIONNE

 Hi!


 AMBER

 Tell me more, tell me more.


 TAI

 Where was I?


 AMBER

 You were thinking about was really important.


 TAI

 Oh, right, right. Right before you die, your mind just sort of gets very clear. It's a very intense, spiritual thing...


 CHER

 Well, I know when I was held at gun-point...


 STUDENT

 Excuse me. (to Tai) You were saying.


 TAI

 It's spiritual. I don't know, I can't, I can't pinpoint the spirituality out for you, you know, if you've never experienced anything...


 SCENE XXXV - CHER'S HOUSE

 CHER V.O.

 But now I don't know how to act around him. I mean, ordinarily I would strut around in my cutest little outfits and send myself flowers and candy, but I couldn't do that stuff with Josh.


 (Cher and Josh are in the lounge watching T.V.)

 JOSH

 What's with you?


 CHER

 What do you mean?


 JOSH

 You're so quiet. You haven't made me watch the real world?


 CHER

 I care about the news.


 JOSH

 Since when?


 CHER

 Since now.


 (T.V. shows scenes from Bosnia)

 JOSH

 You look confused.


 CHER

 Well, uh, I thought they declared peace in the Middle East.


 (Scene changes to Mel's Den with Cher walking past the door in her pyjamas)

 MEL

 Cher, get in here!


 CHER

 What's up Daddy?


 MEL

 What are you doing, dancing infront of my office?


 CHER

 Nothing, I just wanted to see if you needed any help with anything.


 MEL

 Yeah, you caould help me with something. Come over here. Every time that you see a telephone conversation that took place on September third, highlight it. just September third.


 CHER

 OK. 

 MEL

 Fun, huh?


 CHER (laughing)

 Yeah. Daddy, did you ever have a problem that you couldn't argue your way out of?


 MEL

 Tell me the problem, and we'll figure out how to argue it.


 CHER

 I like this boy.


 MEL

 Yes?


 CHER

 And he likes someone else.


 MEL

 How could that be?


 CHER

 I don't know, but I feel wretched.


 MEL

 Well, obviously this boy is a complete moron. You are the most beautiful girl in Beverly Hills. And to tell you the truth, I'm not sure I want you with a stupid fella like that.


 CHER

 Well, actually he is a smart guy and, you know he's one of those do-gooder types, and now I feel like all my after-school commitments are just not good enough.


 MEL

 How can you say that? Who takes care of everyone in this household? Who makes sure that Daddy eats right? To tell you the truth, I have not seen such good-doing sice your mother. 


 CHER

 Really?


 MEL

 Really. Now get back to work.


 SCENE XXXVI - PISMO BEACH DISASTER

 CHER V.O.

 Later, while we were learning about the Pismo Beach diaster, I decided I needed a complete make-over, except this time I'd make-over my soul. But what makes someone a better person? And then I realised, all my friends were really good in different ways. Like, Christian, he always wants things to be beautiful and interesting. Or Dionne and Murray, when they think no one is watching, are so considerate of each other. And poor Miss Giest, always trying to get us involved, no matter how much we resist?


 MISS GIEST

 Oh, it's just, that doesn't even show... you know, every single possesion, every memory, everything you had your whole life... gone in a second. Can you imagine what that must feel like?


 (Elton raises his hand)

 Elton?


 ELTON

 Can I use the Pass?


 MISS GIEST

 Yeah. We'll be collecting blankets, disposable diapers, canned goods...


 (Cher raises her hand)

 CHER

 Miss Giest?


 MISS GIEST

 Cher?


 CHER

 I wanna help.


 MISS GIEST

 That would be wonderful.


 CHER V.O.

 I felt better already.


 (Back at Cher's house)

 CHER

 Daddy?


 MEL

 What?


 CHER

 You didn't like that red caviar, did you?


 MEL

 What's she talking about?


 (Cher starts dragging a heap of stuff to the front door)

 MEL

 Cher, what are you doing?


 CHER

 I'm captain of the Pismo Beach disaster relief.


 MEL

 I don't think they need your skis.


 CHER

 Daddy, some people lost all their belongings, don't you think that includes athletic equipment?


 MEL

 This is your influence, Josh?


 (Scene changes to sign-on stall at school)

 "Shake Some Action" Cracker

 CHER

 Hey, c'mere. Sign up, it's going to be really fun.


 (Scene cahnges to indoors)

 No, you know what? Can you please take it to bedding? Yes, thank you very much.


 Oh, Miss Giest, Miss Giest.


 MISS GIEST

 Yes, dear?


 CHER

 I need more boxes, they're all filled up.


 MISS GIEST

 Already? Great!


 CHER

 I divided them into entres and apetisers.


 MISS GIEST

 Oh, OK, I'll have them picked up.


 TRAVIS

 Hey.


 CHER

 Proper. This is really decent of you Travis.


 TRAVIS

 Sure.


 (Cher picks up a Bong from Travis' box.)

 I wasn't sure about that. I don't need it anymore, but far be it from me to deny anyone else, you know? Oh, I wanted to tell you something, I'm sorry about your shoes.


 CHER

 What shoes?


 TRAVIS

 The red ones with the strappy things?


 CHER

 Oh, those are so last season. What even made you think of them?


 TRAVIS

 Well, it's one of my steps, you see? I joined this club, and there are these steps...


 CHER

 Twelve?


 TRAVIS

 Yeah, twelve! How'd you know?


 CHER

 Wild guess.


 TRAVIS

 Wow, good guess. Ah, also, here.


 (Travis hands Cher a flyer)

 CHER (reading)

 A.S.L. ? 

 TRAVIS

 Ameteur Skateboarding League. This clarity thing has brought me to, like a whole new level with my skating. You gotta see it. Would you come Saturday?


 CHER

 Sure.


 TRAVIS

 Cool!


 CHER (holding up bong)

 Well, um, I guess, kitchenware?


 TRAVIS

 That's where I used to keep it.


 SCENE XXXVII - A.S.L. COMPETITION

 "Mullet Head" Beastie Boys

 (Tai approached Cher at the drinks stand)

 TAI

 Hi?


 CHER

 Hi.


 TAI

 Cher, can I talk to you a minute?


 CHER

 Um, sure.


 TAI

 Look, I have been in agony the past week and I can't even believe that I went off the way I did.


 CHER

 No, I have been going down a shame spiral. I cannot even believe I was so unsupportive of your feelings for Josh.


 TAI

 No, you are entitled to your own opinion, alright? I'm the tart here. Cher, you've been nothing but super-duper nice to me.


 CHER

 Not even. If it wasn't for me, you wouldn't have even liked that loser, Elton. I'm so sorry, Tai.


 TAI

 Cher, I'm really sorry. Oh, shit. Now I'm going to go ahead and cry.


 CHER

 Let's never fight again, OK?


 (Cher and Tai hug. Travis is announced on the P.A.)

 PA

 Next up, number fourteen, Travis Berkenstock.


 (The girls sit down, excitedly giggling and pointing to Travis.)

 TAI

 Alright Travis!


 CHER

 I had no idea he was so motivated.


 TAI

 Oh, I did.


 CHER V.O.

 When I saw the sparks between Tai and Travis, I knew Josh was out of the picture.


 SCENE XXXVIII - CHER'S HOUSE

 JOSH

 You look like Pippi Longstocking.


 CHER

 Well, you look like Forrest Gump. Who's Pippi Longstocking?


 JOSH

 Someone Mel Gibson never played.


 CHER

 Funny.


 (Cher lets her hair down, and Josh is dumbfounded by her beauty)

 LAWYER

 What happened to the August 28th files?


 JOSH

 Hmm, what?


 LAWYER

 Mel wanted them tonight, there were twice as many. He's gonna go ballistic, where are they?


 CHER

 I think I checked them for the September third conversation.


 LAWYER

 What?


 JOSH

 Where'd you put them?


 CHER

 I divided them into two piles. Is that wrong?


 LAWYER

 Oh, my God. I have to redo all that. What are you, some kind of idiot?


 JOSH

 Hey, she didn't know.


 LAWYER

 She just set us back a day. Who cares about the September call? Now we're screwed!


 CHER

 I'm sorry.


 LAWYER

 Just forget it, OK? Just go back to the mall or something.


 (Cher runs out of the room)

 JOSH

 What's your problem, man? She didn't mean any harm.


 LAWYER

 I'm gonna get killed because she's a moron.


 JOSH

 She's not a moron. You know, if you were paying attention to your assignment, it wouldn't have happened.


 LAWYER

 Well, if you hadn't been playing footsy with the dumb kid, she wouldn't be bothering me.


 JOSH

 What the hell are you talking about?!


 LAWYER

 You know exactly what I'm talking about. Josh, this is a multi-million dollar law suit, not some excuse for puppy-love.


 JOSH

 Look, we've been working our butts off on this case!


 LAWYER

 Well, tell you what? You do whatever you want with your butts, I'm calling in sick.


 (Lawyer leaves while Josh slams the door behind him. Cher is sitting at the top of the stairs)

 CHER

 Did I really ruin Daddy's law suit?


 JOSH

 No.


 (Josh moves up to sit beside Cher)

 Of course not.


 CHER

 Well, did I set him back? I mean, there's so much work to be done, and he can't afford to lose that time.


 JOSH

 Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it. Your father won't lose any time. Can you imagine the nerve of that guy? I mean, making you worry like that, and yet, he's the one that screwed up and then he goes and blames us. Imagine saying we were... you know?


 CHER

 That's right, you've been very dedicated to this case.


 JOSH

 Yeah, well, it's a good learning experience, at least for me, I want to be a lawyer. But you, I mean, you don't need to be doing this. Go out and have fun, go shopping.


 CHER

 You think that's all I do, I'm just a ditz with a credit card?


 JOSH

 No, no, ah, that's not what I meant.


 (Josh just stutters a bit, looking for the right words)

 You're young and beautiful...and...


 CHER

 And?


 JOSH

 And, well, uh, what?


 CHER

 You think I'm beautiful?


 (YES, YES!!!! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, YES!!!!)

 JOSH

 You know your gorgeous, alright? And popular, and, um, and... but this is not why I, you know, I come here. This is a good learning experience for me.


 CHER

 You already said that.


 JOSH

 Mel, I wanna help out Mel. He's the only one who cares about me.


 CHER

 That's not true.


 JOSH

 He's not? Are you saying you care about me?


 CHER

 Josh.


 (Cher goes to hit his shoulder, but he catches her with a kiss. Good move!)

 (Both like it. So they try again.)

 CHER V.O.

 Well, you can guess what happened next.


 SCENE XXXIX - THE WEDDING

 CHER V.O.

 As if! I am only sixteen, and this is California, not Kentucky.


 (Mr. Hall and Miss Giest get married)

 TAI

 I know, that when I have my own wedding, I want this, like whole entire floral motif, very floral garlens... floral dresses.


 DIONNE

 No, no, no, no. When I get married, I'm gonna have a sailor dress, but it's going to be a gown, and all my bridesmaids are gonna wear sailor hats... with vails.


 TAI

 That sounds so cool.


 MURRAY

 Oh, my God. They're planning our weddings already. Could you all stop all that to death do us part mumbo-jumbo. I'm telling ya, man, I'm completely buggin'.


 JOSH

 I'm buggin' myself.


 (Miss Stoeger runs on the scene)

 MISS STOEGER

 Girls! She's about to throw the bouquet, c'mon!


 (Miss Stoeger, Dionne and Tai run off)

 JOSH (to Cher)

 Look, we got a pool going to see who's girl gets the bouquet. It's up to two hundred dollars.


 CHER

 It's in the bag.


 "Tenderness" General Public

 (All the girls are jumping around waiting for the bouquet. Miss Giest/Mrs. Hall throws it amongst them. The bouquet exchanges hands and they all fall down. Classic scene! Cher ends up with it.)


 (Cher and Josh kiss. It's the one scene that I'll never get out of mind for the rest of my life. Simply awesome lip-lock!)

                                Frank Hannah & Wayne Kramer

                

               EXT. STYGIAN DARKNESS - NIGHT

               STYGIAN DARKNESS

               The suggestion of traveling through space. Suddenly a star 
               sparkles to life in the distance. Gives rise to another... 
               and another... until we're looking at a whole galaxy of stars. 
               No, not stars. LIGHTS. NEON LIGHTS. A throbbing skyline of 
               neon. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. As seen from a descending aerial 
               shot. We PLUNGE down into her shimmering embrace... DISSOLVING 
               TO:

               EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT

               Cruising the Strip, taking in modern day Las Vegas. Sin City 
               gone theme park. Gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: THE 
               MGM GRAND... EXCALIBUR... LUXOR... TREASURE ISLAND... passing 
               revamped faithfuls like CAESARS and THE DESERT INN...

               ...then heading DOWNTOWN to Fremont Street, where "old school" 
               Vegas makes its last stand. BINION'S HORSESHOE, THE FOUR 
               QUEENS, THE LAS VEGAS CLUB arid...

               THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO

               One thing's for sure. This place ain't no bastard child of 
               Epcott Center. At least, not yet. Sure there's some flash 
               going on, but it's more class than overkill.

               This is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten. A 
               joint where every dealer knows your name. Where part of the 
               allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper 
               of worn felt. Where "funny business" doesn't just get you 
               blacklisted... It gets you dead.

               Lets us enter.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - NIGHT

               CREDITS SEQUENCE

               TRACKING through the casino floor; highlighting SLOT MACHINE 
               PAY-OFFS and pockets of rowdy players winning at BLACKJACK, 
               CRAPS and ROULETTE. It's just one of those nights. The tables 
               are on fire.

               A FLOOR MANAGER nods as a hefty bet is paid out to a shooter 
               at a craps table: He checks out his watch, anxious for the 
               arrival of...

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               From behind a FIGURE in a suit. All we see is a murky 
               reflection in gold elevator doors. The floor numbers 
               descending rapidly...

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               STICKMEN, CROUPIERS, DEALERS

               all anticipating the arrival of...

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               The elevator doors open... and we PAN DOWN to the figure's 
               feet. He steps out onto the casino floor... and right away 
               we notice he has a pronounced limp.

               Following behind the figure. We haven't seen his features 
               yet... (and won't for a while.)

               TRACKING SERIES 

               -- the figure (seen in soft focus) passes a ROULETTE TABLE, 
               the wheel already in mid-spin. His hand casually brushes the 
               side of the table... and we PAN ACROSS to the wheel -- just 
               in time to see the ball landing on 00. The players HOWL 
               defeat. The croupier rakes in all the losing checks with a 
               slight nod of respect to the passing wraith...

               -- TRACKING PAST SOME BLACKJACK TABLES... RACKING from the 
               passing figure (still in soft focus) to a DEALER calling 
               out:

                                     DEALER
                         Insurance?

               At the next table, ANOTHER DEALER pulls a six card 21. Off 
               the players' stunned reactions. No way! One of the players 
               instinctively glances behind him... but the figure has moved 
               on. The dealer stifles a grin, her eyes following the figure 
               as he heads toward...

               -- A HOT CRAPS TABLE. The CROWD APPLAUDS as the shooter lands 
               a hard eight. The dice are fished back to the player. He 
               shakes them up with double ought bravado. We RACK from his 
               hand LARGE in the f.g. to our murky figure passing in the 
               background. The player throws... (we keep tracking with the 
               figure) as the stickman calls it: SEVEN OUT! to a thundering 
               chorus of disappointment.

               -- Our figure passes by in the foreground, while in the 
               background, we see a growing line of shame at one of the ATM 
               MACHINES.

               -- Following behind our figure as he turns into a corridor 
               of SLOT MACHINES. CUT TO REVERSE ANGLE from the far end of 
               the corridor. As the murky figure approaches, a player in 
               the f.g. hits a jackpot.

               Another player in mid-ground is also in the midst of a payout.

               Suddenly -- with the approach of the figure -- both payouts 
               trickle to a stop.

                                     PLAYER IN F.G.
                              (kicks the slot machine)
                         Don't you hold back, baby. Spit it 
                         out, darlin'. C'mon... Hey! Hey, 
                         this ain't right. S'posed to be eight 
                         hundred dollars. Where's the goddamn 
                         manager? Who's in charge of these 
                         rip-off slots? Yo, ma'am... change 
                         lady...

               CASINO BAR FLOOR - BAR AREA - NIGHT

               FOLLOWING BEHIND the figure as he turns out of the slot 
               corridor and heads over to the bar. He pours himself a cup 
               of coffee.

                                     FIGURE/BERNIE
                         Hey Doris, you got any cream?

               DORIS THE BARTENDER wanders over with a small container. She 
               starts to pour... Empty. We quickly STEADICAM AROUND to reveal 
               BERNIE LOOTZ's features for the first time. His sad sack 
               eyes register scant surprise at the empty cream container.

                                     BERNIE
                         Forget it.

               He's just about to leave, when an attractive COCKTAIL WAITRESS 
               cruises up. NATALIE BELISARIO -- late 20's-mid-30's. 
               Everything about her sparkles, except her eyes.

               They're post-mortem. She appears frazzled. Sifts through 
               some coin tips.

                                     NATALIE
                              (sotto)
                         Shit.
                              (to Doris)
                         Dewars and a Diet Coke. Please.

               A sheepish look comes over Bernie. He tries to catch her 
               eye. She doesn't even glance at him.

                                     BERNIE
                         Hi, Natalie.

               She looks at him. Only the faintest hint of recognition.

                                     NATALIE
                         Hi. Uh...

                                     BERNIE
                         Bernie.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah, Bernie.
                              (to Doris)
                         Hey, you seen Shelly around? He 
                         promised to position me at the tables 
                         tonight. I've been on skid row all 
                         week.

                                     DORIS
                              (chilly)
                         You didn't settle me from last night.

                                     NATALIE
                         No? You sure? Fuck... And I was way 
                         under. It's been, like, an A.A. 
                         convention the whole week. I'll make 
                         up for it tonight. Promise.

               Doris mutters something under her breath -- heard that one 
               before -- and dumps Natalie's drinks on her tray.

                                     BERNIE
                         If I see Shelly, I'll let him know. 
                         That you're looking for him.

               Natalie grabs up her tray. Doesn't even look at Bernie.

                                     NATALIE
                         Thanks.

               She takes off.

                                     DORIS
                         Bitch. That's the third time this 
                         month...
                              (to Bernie)
                         Let me get you that cream.

                                     BERNIE
                              (staring after Natalie)
                         Nah, it's okay.

                                     DORIS
                         Don't get sweet on that, Bernie. Not 
                         unless you're looking to get short-
                         changed.

               She raises the empty cream container for effect, turns it 
               over. A few drops dribble out.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie limps away from the bar. We hear another spike of 
               sound from the gaming area. As he approaches, a FLOORMAN 
               stops him.

                                     FLOORMAN
                         Hey, Bernie, Shelly needs you on 
                         eleven.

                                     BERNIE
                              (nods)
                         Uh... Let's do the Chivas Regal. 
                         Have that... Natalie bring it over. 
                         The one working nickel slots next to 
                         the Paradise. I spoke to Shelly 
                         earlier, he wants her at the tables.

               The floorman nods, walks off. Bernie makes for the rowdy 
               gaming tables. Takes his time about it. His approach brings 
               an ill-wind to the area. The players appear to sense it.

               It's in their reactions. A slight hesitation of the dice.

               Fingers tensing over a pile of chips. A hand tugging at a 
               tie.

               The Cooler has arrived.

               As he reaches table eleven, Natalie intercepts him with a 
               short glass of Chivas Regal.

                                     NATALIE
                         This is you, right?

                                     BERNIE
                              (takes it from her)
                         Thanks.

                                     NATALIE
                         Joe said I should stick around. You 
                         say something to Shelly?

               Bernie just smiles at her.

                                     NATALIE
                         Wow. That was fast. Hey, thanks.

               She offers up a smile. It jump-starts those dormant eyes.

               Her whole face comes alive. Notches her up from an eight to 
               a ten. Bernie immediately glances away. He's afraid what she 
               might read in his gaze.

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't mention it.

               Bernie gestures her over to table eleven. Immediately makes 
               the HIGH ROLLER in question. A good old boy named BULLDOG.

               He's the one boasting loudly as he shakes the dice with one 
               hand.

                                     BULLDOG
                         I'll make you a fortune on five and 
                         nine. C'mon forty-five-sixty-three 
                         fifty-four!

               Bernie grabs the drink from Natalie's tray, intentionally 
               bumps Bulldog...

                                     BERNIE
                         Hey, buddy, is this your drink?

                                     BULLDOG
                         Back off, pal. I'm on a roll here.

               Another man gladly accepts the drink. Meanwhile, Bulldog 
               sends the dice high up into the air. They drop perfectly on 
               the table. The stickman calls it.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out!

                                     BULLDOG
                         Mother-fucker!

                                     STICKMAN
                         Thank you for those bets, folks.

               The croupiers hungrily devour the chips from the table.

               Bernie moves on quietly before anyone notices.

               But he's been noticed all right. By Natalie. Not quite sure 
               what she's just witnessed. Who is this guy?

               We hear a VOICE over the intercom.

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Conway, party of twelve, please check 
                         your reservation at the Paradise 
                         Lounge.

               Bernie reacts immediately to the code words over the speaker.

                                     BERNIE
                              (to himself)
                         Yeah, yeah, I'm comin'...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CASINO FLOOR CRAPS TABLE - MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A -- a player makes a hard six at a craps table. The players 
               howl...

               B -- from the same angle we PAN UP from losing dice to the 
               same guy. Bernie looming large in the background.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT

               A -- Bernie taking a seat at another blackjack table. Next 
               to him, a full table of players on a good run of cards.

               B -- The same table with less players as the dealer appears 
               to be gaining an edge over the players. The only thing filling 
               up are ashtrays.

               C -- Same again, with one player. This time with Natalie 
               watching in the background. Intrigued. QUICK JUMP CUTS show 
               the player's mountain of chips going down until there is 
               only one.

               D -- The dealer taps the felt for the man to bet his last 
               chip. After a moment of indecision he flips the chip into 
               the air...

                                                             BRIDGE CUT TO:

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - OVERLOOKING THE CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               ...the chip becoming an Alka-Seltzer dropping into a glass.

               The glass is in SHELLY KAPLOW's hand. Director of Casino 
               Operations for the Shangri-la. Late 40's-early 50's.

               Distinguished, slick, oozing charm. But lose the Cartier, 
               Armani and Paco Raban and you're looking at pure street.

               He's watching Bernie through the two-way glass. Shakes his 
               head in admiration.

               Suddenly the office door swings open. THREE MEN stride in.

               Shelly projects immediate deference to NICKY "FINGERS" 
               BONNATTO. Mid-50's. Former Geovassi family underboss from 
               "back east." The guy's a relic from the days before MBAs 
               became the weapon of choice in the "family" business. He 
               wears his corporate makeover like a bad coat of paint with 
               traces of Mulberry Street primer showing through.

               Nicky's accompanied by a pair of CORPORATE TYPES in Hugo 
               Boss threads. Shelly glances their way with a look that 
               suggests he's working himself into a full-on sphincter wind-
               up. Bad news x2. Shelly's muscle, LOU stands off to one side 
               with an apologetic expression.

                                     SHELLY
                         Nicky, how the hell are you? I didn't 
                         know you were coming in...

               Nicky reaches out to shake Shelly's hand. Gets nothing back, 
               then remembers.

                                     NICKY
                              (shakes his head)
                         Whassimater? You think I don't wash 
                         up after goin' to the John? Forget 
                         about it.

               Nicky grabs Shelly, embraces him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (uncomfortably)
                         You shoulda called ahead. I woulda 
                         sent a car...

                                     NICKY
                         Ehh. We thought we'd surprise you.

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, anytime, Nicky. Anytime.

               Shelly sizes up the corporate types.

                                     NICKY
                         Shelly, I want you to meet one of 
                         our smartest VPs, Larry Sokolov. And 
                         his numbers guy, Marty Goldfarb.

               Shelly sees where this is going. Larry extends his hand...

                                     LARRY
                         How do you do, Shelly?

               ...then catches himself. Quickly pulls it back. Shelly stares 
               him down for a tense beat.

                                     SHELLY
                         What can I get you boys to drink?

               Off their uncomfortable expressions...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - A SHORT WHILE LATER - NIGHT

               Shelly seated across from Nicky, Larry and Marty.

                                     SHELLY
                         So... what brings you to town, Nicky?

               Nicky looks cautiously across the table.

                                     NICKY
                         Look, Shelly, this is your joint, 
                         you run it the way you see fit. But 
                         we got a smart kid here and he's got 
                         some good ideas on how to revitalize 
                         the Shangri-la.

                                     SHELLY
                         Revitalize? What are you talking 
                         about? We did thirty-five million 
                         last year.

               Nicky shoots a look over at Larry and Marty. Larry takes 
               this as his cue.

                                     LARRY
                         First off, Shelly, I want you to 
                         know, I have nothing but respect for 
                         you. You've done a fantastic job 
                         with the Shangri-la for the last 
                         sixteen years. No one would dispute 
                         that.

                                     NICKY
                         Yeah, no one doubts that, Shelly.

               Shelly nods carefully. But...

                                     LARRY
                         But, the business has changed out 
                         here. You just have to take a look 
                         at the Strip to see what I'm talking 
                         about.

                                     SHELLY
                         You mean, that amusement park mook 
                         fest out there? You know what that 
                         is? That's a fucking violation of 
                         something that used to be beautiful. 
                         That used to have class. Like a 
                         gorgeous high priced hooker with an 
                         exclusive clientele. And then that 
                         Steve Wynn cocksucker knocks her up 
                         and puts her in a family way.

               Nicky and Larry exchange looks. Marty drops his gaze into 
               his lap.

                                     SHELLY
                         Now she's nothing but a cheap, fat 
                         whore hiding behind too much makeup. 
                         I look at her and see all those ugly 
                         stretch marks and I want to cry. 
                         'Cause I remember her as she was.

                                     LARRY
                         Yes, well... there's no denying the 
                         bottom line. Those eyesores are raking 
                         it in. And we can't compete against 
                         that.

                                     SHELLY
                         What? You think I'm trying to compete 
                         with that? You think this joint's 
                         about bringing in the stroller crowd? 
                         Fresh off some fucking E-ticket ride, 
                         looking to break the house on red 
                         and black. Fremont's never been about 
                         that bullshit. This is where old 
                         time and real money comes to play.

                                     LARRY
                         The numbers, they don't back you up, 
                         Shelly. Nostalgia's grand. We all 
                         love nostalgia -- but it belongs in 
                         a museum. I think it's time to decide 
                         whether you're running a museum or a 
                         casino.

               Shelly is close to losing it. He catches himself, takes a 
               breath.

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, forget about it. We'll talk 
                         later. Over dinner.

                                     MARTY
                              (rubs his hands 
                              together)
                         So, how's the action?

               Larry shoots him a disapproving look. Off Shelly's disturbed 
               expression. He's already calculating serious damage control.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie makes his way across the casino floor, when he's 
               intercepted by Shelly.

                                     SHELLY
                         Bernie. Mr. Cool. Got a moment?

                                     BERNIE
                         I was just heading over to --

                                     SHELLY
                         It can wait.

               Shelly escorts Bernie over to a nearby bar area. The BARTENDER 
               zips over with some drinks.

                                     SHELLY
                         How's the knee?

               Bernie shrugs. Natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away.

               Puts in a drink order. She catches Bernie's eye. Nods.

               Bernie smiles.

                                     SHELLY
                         I was speaking to this orthopedic 
                         surgeon over at Vegas Memorial. He 
                         tells me they can replace a man's 
                         entire kneecap with titanium. It's 
                         the kinda thing that costs a shitload, 
                         but since the man's into us for five 
                         hundred large, I'm sure we could --

                                     BERNIE
                              (stealing glances at 
                              Natalie)
                         I told you, I'm not gonna be around 
                         after Sunday.

                                     SHELLY
                              (sighs)
                         Where you gonna go, Bernie? Where 
                         the fuck are you gonna go that's 
                         better'n here? I got you covered in 
                         this town. People, they know you 
                         work for me, that's currency in your 
                         pocket. That's fuckin' respect when 
                         you walk the floor. Where you gonna 
                         get that anyplace else?

                                     BERNIE
                              (sighs)
                         Seven days, Shelly. Seven days and 
                         I'm out from under.

               A beautiful WOMAN in a low cut dress, sashays her way past 
               them, heading for a high rollers craps table. Shelly reaches 
               out, napkin in hand, grabs her arm. Hands her his card. She 
               snatches it, looks it over. Immediately loses all attitude.

               Oh shit.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's right. I like to know who's 
                         shopping it in my neighborhood. You 
                         wanna keep working the Shangri-la, 
                         you come see me tomorrow morning in 
                         my office. We'll go over the rules 
                         together. And before you come, you 
                         bring me a clean bill of health. OK?

               The hooker just nods.

                                     SHELLY
                         All right, get outta here.

               She takes off. At the same time Natalie leaves with her drink 
               order. They walk in the same direction. Shelly mistakes 
               Bernie's wandering look for interest in the hooker.

                                     SHELLY
                         You want that, Bernie? She's yours. 
                         Anytime. I'll keep a tab running for 
                         you.
                              (Bernie shakes his 
                              head)
                         What's a matter? Not your type?

               Bernie just stares after Natalie, Shelly finally picking up 
               on it.

                                     BERNIE
                         Things are getting hot on fourteen. 
                         I gotta go.

               He limps off. Shelly stares after him. A predator seizing up 
               his prey. Calculating.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie's 1958 Buick Electra pulls into the parking lot of a 
               flea-bag motel. Next door to the motel, we see a convenience 
               store with the name, THE EZ MARK in pink glowing neon. It's 
               actually supposed to read: The EZ MARKET, but the last two 
               letters of "Market" have burned out.

               INT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

               One of those center pool style motels. A hard luck oasis, if 
               ever there was one.

               As Bernie limps toward his room, his neighbor, a low rent 
               HOOKER, approaches from the opposite end of the courtyard 
               with a huge-ass JOHN in tow.

               They converge at their doors at the same time. There's a 
               weariness about the hooker that's endemic to this town. She 
               winks at Bernie. He nods at her. Then casts a furtive glance 
               over at the John. The man flips him off. The hooker mouths, 
               "Sorry." Bernie hastily enters his apartment.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie flips on the light. A dim overhead bulb hardly makes 
               a dent in the gloomy surroundings. Typical drab motel 
               furnishings.

               We notice a couple of dead plants on the radiator next to 
               the window. A single place setting on the counter. Something 
               odd: an empty cat food bowl on the kitchenette floor. No 
               sign of a cat. Go figure.

               Bernie heads over to the dresser. A half-filled bottle of 
               gin rests next to a lone glass with a crack down the side.

               He pours himself a shot. Turns on the TV. A religious channel. 
               Shitty reception.

               ON SCREEN:

               an Appalachian Pentecostal service. The members of the 
               congregation taking up snakes and writhing around in religious 
               hysteria, while a number at the bottom of the screen solicits 
               viewer donations.

               Bernie doesn't even try to change the channel. He takes a 
               seat on his bed, props himself up against a pair of pillows, 
               stretches out.

               From next door, the sounds of wild humping.

                                     HOOKER (O.S.)
                         ...Oh yeah, baby, give it to me. Oh 
                         yeah, that's the spot... Do it to me 
                         harder, you big stud... Oooooh...

               Bernie closes his eyes, tries to ignore the X-rated soundtrack 
               coming at him through the carpaccio thin walls.

               The hooker's moans are starting to get to him. He raises his 
               fist to the wall, then stops himself. He's just not the 
               confrontational type.

               Instead, he heads over to the TV, cranks the volume up. The 
               hysterical moaning from the snake ritual now blends in with 
               the grunting and groaning from next door, making for a bizarre 
               remix that could only exist in the world of Bernie Lootz. 
               Bernie emits a deep sigh, closes his eyes.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Big action at the craps tables tonight. The players cheer as 
               MR. PINKERTON makes another pass. He exudes USED CAR SALESMAN.

               Natalie arrives with his drink.

                                     NATALIE
                         Seven and Seven?

               Pinkerton reaches for the drink without taking his eyes off 
               the table. He throws a hard six. The crowd cheers again.

               He turns around, stuffs a hundred dollar chip down her shirt 
               and slyly cops a feel.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Thanks, dollface.

               Natalie shudders in disgust. She spins around to leave... 
               runs smack into Bernie, spilling her tray of drinks on him.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz.

               Bernie wipes himself off, helps her pick up the pieces.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's all right. Happens.

               Natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands, 
                         you know...

                                     BERNIE
                         S'okay. You might want to stick 
                         around.

               Bernie wiggles his way next to Pinkerton. He gives the 
               stickman a certain look.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have 
                         no hard eight.

                                     PINKERTON
                              (throwing in a chip)
                         Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight.

               Bernie just watches as Pinkerton throws the dice.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight the hard way!

               The players go nuts. The stickman taps the felt in front of 
               the shooter.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Parlay! Parlay!

               The Boxman seated at the center looks up at him.

                                     PINKERTON
                         C'mon. You can take that action.

               The Boxman feigns concern, then nods in approval.

                                     PINKERTON
                         That's what I'm talking about. None 
                         of this low limit bullshit.

               Just as the stickman feeds Pinkerton the dice, Bernie flips 
               a dollar chip over toward the center of the table. Natalie 
               peers between them to catch a glimpse.

                                     BERNIE
                         Dollar hard eight.

               The chip lands on Pinkerton's parlayed bet. He releases the 
               dice from his stubby little fingers.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight 
                         comes down.

               The players cry out in defeat. Pinkerton grumbles to himself. 
               He fingers his rail of chips.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Five hundred dollar hard eight. And 
                         press my nine up two units.

               He throws in the chips. The croupier places his bets. The 
               dice are fed back to him. He throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Easy way eight! Eight easy!

               Pinkerton is fit to be tied. After a passing moment of clarity 
               he empties his entire rail.

                                     PINKERTON
                         Hard eight.

               The entire table stops down for a second.

                                     PLAYER (O.S.)
                         Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm.

               Pinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out!

               Pinkerton slams his fist down on the table. He turns to leave 
               the table to find Natalie smiling at him.

                                     PINKERTON
                         What the fuck you smiling at, bitch?

               Pinkerton starts to lose it. Security moves in, right on 
               time. Natalie shoots Bernie a satisfied look. He averts his 
               eyes shyly and limps away. She stares after him for a moment.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               BUDDY STAFFORD, the Paradise Lounge's star attraction, is 
               performing on stage. He's a poor man's Tony Bennett. Mid to 
               late 60's. A staple at the Paradise for the last 20 years.

               The singer sluggishly descends the stage to the lounge floor, 
               almost tripping over his microphone cable.

               Buddy works the room, leaning in real close to the ladies, 
               delivering the requisite eye contact. When their companions 
               react with mock outrage, Buddy raises his fists playfully in 
               a boxer's defensive stance. It's classic Buddy Stafford 
               schtick.

               From somewhere across the lounge, an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN jumps 
               up and throws her panties at Buddy. Buddy catches them and 
               waves them in the air... just as another pair whizzes by...

               We PAN ACROSS to Shelly seated at his corner booth, in the 
               company of Nicky Fingers, Larry and Marty.

               TIGHT ON SHELLY as he focuses on Buddy. A smile threatens 
               his patented stoicism. He's flashing back on the old days.

               While Nicky and Marty are clearly enjoying Buddy's 
               performance, Larry fixates on the singer with joyless eyes.

               We take on LARRY'S POV of Buddy --

               SLOW MOTION CLOSE-UPS of BUDDY SINGING. The MUSIC SLOWED 
               DOWN with the action, emphasizing Buddy's lack of energy.

               Sweat dripping off Buddy's forehead, splattering into tiny 
               jewels against his microphone. Buddy's tired eyes. Shaking 
               hands around the mic.

               SMASH CUT to real time APPLAUSE as Buddy reaches the end of 
               the song. Larry is the only one not clapping. RACK ACROSS to 
               Shelly as he picks up on this.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly approaches Buddy's dressing room. He enters without 
               knocking...

               INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               ...to find a trembling Buddy hunched over on a sofa, hugging 
               himself. Buddy immediately sits up...

                                     BUDDY
                         Shelly. I was a goddamn embarrassment 
                         tonight. I shouldn'a let you talk me 
                         into going on.
                              (massages his throat)
                         It's definitely strep.

                                     SHELLY
                         You were velvet out there, pops. 
                         Silk.

               Shelly throws a pair of red silk panties to Buddy. We see a 
               room number scribbled on the crotch area.

                                     SHELLY
                         They were hanging on the door outside. 
                         Forget your tonsils. When the muff 
                         confetti stops coming, that's when 
                         you got yourself a problem.

                                     BUDDY
                              (dangling the panties 
                              on his finger)
                         You get a receipt?

                                     SHELLY
                         Excuse me?

                                     BUDDY
                         Charmayne's in the lobby. They got 
                         these on sale in the window. Victoria 
                         Secret's Valentine's Collection. And 
                         the broad waiting in the room, what 
                         she set you back? Always Grade-A for 
                         Ol' Buddy.

                                     SHELLY
                         Are you kidding me? Gimme that.
                              (snatches the panties 
                              away from Buddy)
                         You don't fucking deserve this. All 
                         those ladies going home with a sweet 
                         breeze between their legs because 
                         you still do it for them and you're 
                         fingering me for some kinda Buddy 
                         Stafford ego pimp. Hey, fuck you, 
                         old man.

               Shelly feigns as if he's leaving.

                                     BUDDY
                              (affectionately)
                         Get back here, you prick. Hand it 
                         over.

               Shelly throws the panties back at Buddy. Buddy just stares 
               at him with pained eyes, waiting for something else. Sweat 
               mirror balls his wrinkled forehead.

               Shelly nods. Removes a foil package from his pocket. Hands 
               it to Buddy. The singer rushes over to his dressing table.

               Unwraps his works. Rubber tubes his forearm. Trembling hands 
               juggle lighter and hypodermic.

               Shelly takes a seat on the sofa. Buddy, euphoric as the dope 
               hits the spot. Tears in his eyes. He picks up on Shelly's 
               somber expression in the mirror.

                                     BUDDY
                         Whassimatter, kid? You got that 
                         Nostradamus look.

               Shelly shakes his head.

                                     BUDDY
                         You ever watch those nature shows on 
                         TV?

               Shelly shakes his head.

                                     BUDDY
                         I've seen this one a dozen times. 
                         It's about lions. Cycle of life thing. 
                         The leader of the pack...

                                     SHELLY
                         Pride. It's called a pride.

                                     BUDDY
                         Yeah, pride. The leader of the 
                         pride... when he gets on in years. 
                         It's just a matter of time before 
                         some young male arrives on the scene 
                         to challenge him. They go at it and 
                         the old cat gets the crap beaten 
                         outta him. It's humiliating. In front 
                         of all the females, this goes down. 
                         And after he's defeated, he's cast 
                         out of the pride, to scavenge and 
                         die alone in the bush.

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah, nature's got a real sick sense 
                         of humor.

                                     BUDDY
                         No shit. It's fucking tragic because 
                         the old lion can't figure it out on 
                         his own. That he's past it. It'd be 
                         so much easier for him to just walk 
                         away and save himself all that pain 
                         and humiliation.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's like admitting to yourself 
                         that you're already dead. I prefer 
                         nature's way.

                                     BUDDY
                              (a beat)
                         Yeah. Me, too.

               Shelly holds Buddy's gaze in the mirror.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly exits the dressing room, to find Larry waiting on 
               him.

               He's accompanied by a good looking YOUNG MAN.

                                     LARRY
                         Shelly, got a minute...

               Shelly's expression: no. But he heads over anyway.

                                     LARRY
                         Shelly, this is Johnny Capella.

                                     JOHNNY
                         How ya doin', Shelly?

               Johnny extends his hand. Shelly ignores the gesture.

                                     SHELLY
                         I know you from somewhere, right?

                                     LARRY
                         Johnny's been opening for Danny Ganz 
                         at the Mirage. Sony's talking about 
                         signing him to a three album deal. 
                         They're positioning him as the new 
                         Ricki Martin.

                                     SHELLY
                         And I should be interested in this, 
                         why?

                                     LARRY
                         Johnny's looking to headline. I told 
                         him we might be interested.

                                     SHELLY
                              (icy)
                         We?

                                     JOHNNY
                         Hey, if this is a bad time...

                                     SHELLY
                         Even if I were interested, Buddy's 
                         got ink with us through 2003. I just 
                         renegotiated his contract last year.

                                     JOHNNY
                         Sounds like the two of you need to 
                         get on the same page.
                              (to Larry)
                         If I don't hear from you by Thursday, 
                         I'm taking the Stardust's offer.

               Johnny nods at Shelly, takes off. Shelly and Larry eyeball 
               each other for a long, cold beat. Shelly's about to say 
               something, when Nicky and Marty approach. Larry shrugs, 
               flashes a chilling smile.

                                     NICKY
                         Where's Buddy? I wanna buy the old 
                         fart a drink.

                                     SHELLY
                         Buddy asked me to send you his 
                         regards, Nicky. He's not feeling so 
                         great. I think he's got that stomach 
                         flu that's going around.

                                     NICKY
                         Oh yeah? That's too bad.
                              (Shelly isn't fooling 
                              him)
                         Well, another time then.

                                     MARTY
                         Hey, Shelly, Nicky says you might be 
                         able to hook us up with some 
                         showgirls. Something with class.

               Shelly eyeballs Marty for a tense, extended beat. What do I 
               look like, some fuckin' pimp, college boy? Just as Marty's 
               starting to get real uncomfortable, Shelly cracks a smile.

                                     SHELLY
                         Sure, no problem. You got any 
                         preferences?

                                     NICKY
                              (jumps in)
                         Yeah. Something with big headlights, 
                         nice rims and low mileage.

                                     MARTY
                         You got any Asian babes?

               Shelly looks to Larry.

                                     LARRY
                         I think I'll just stick with the 
                         tables.

               We linger on Shelly's unsettled look. This guy is bad news.

               EXT. SHANGRI-LA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bernie weaves his way through the lot to his car. Arriving 
               at his Buick, he's startled to find Natalie leaning against 
               it. She holds up the $100 chip the drunk tipped her.

                                     NATALIE
                         Buy you a drink?

               Off of Bernie's surprised expression...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

               Cheesy Polynesian decor. Mood lighting = an excuse to keep 
               the electric down. Basically, a joint where people come to 
               lose themselves.

               Natalie and Bernie are seated in a booth near the back. She 
               sips on an umbrella drink; he's nursing his usual gin.

               Natalie has an astrological chart in front of her. In between 
               sips, she makes annotations to the chart.

                                     NATALIE
                              (almost to herself)
                         Your Progressed Venus is Gemini, 
                         12.5 Degrees, and is in Direct motion. 
                         Which tells me that you're a slow 
                         starter when it comes to romance.
                              (off Bernie's taken 
                              aback expression)
                         You know what? This is real 
                         unprofessional of me. I shouldn't 
                         discuss your chart with you until 
                         I'm all done. I can tell by that 
                         look, you think this is all a lot of 
                         B.S.

                                     BERNIE
                         No... I just know what the outcome's 
                         going to be.

                                     NATALIE
                         The outcome? There's not, like, one 
                         particular outcome. A lot of things 
                         enter into it. The planets, moon 
                         phases...

                                     BERNIE
                         The outcome won't change with me. 
                         It'll be all bad.

                                     NATALIE
                         God, I have never met anyone who was 
                         so down on themselves. I used to be 
                         down on myself, OK? I don't go there 
                         anymore. I've got just three more 
                         correspondence classes with this 
                         stuff, then I'll have my certificate 
                         and everything. And you know how I 
                         got OK?

                                     BERNIE
                              (deadpan)
                         You had your chart done.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yes, as a matter of fact that is 
                         perfectly correct.

                                     BERNIE
                         Do you know what I do at the Shangri-
                         la?

                                     NATALIE
                         I asked around. You're a "cooler." 
                         You turn winners into losers.

                                     BERNIE
                         And do you know how I do that?

                                     NATALIE
                         I know there's stuff that goes on in 
                         casinos all the time --

                                     BERNIE
                         I do it by being myself. People get 
                         next to me and their luck turns. 
                         It's always been that way.

                                     NATALIE
                         That sounds to me like a self 
                         fulfilling prophecy. There's a whole 
                         chapter on that in my course. Anyways, 
                         I can see a big factor in your life 
                         is that you're lacking companionship. 
                         There's nobody to deflect off. If 
                         you've got, as you put it, bad karma, 
                         then you need someone with good karma 
                         to neutralize it. Well, that's my 
                         take on it anyway.

               Bernie maintains eye contact with Natalie for an extended 
               beat. Then drops his head, gazes at his glass.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't know about you, but I'm real 
                         tired.

               Natalie nods. Bernie motions to stand. Natalie just remains 
               seated. Keeps talking.

                                     NATALIE
                         I have this recurring dream where 
                         I'm on some beautiful island in the 
                         Bahamas. I'm sitting on the beach, 
                         taking in this amazing sunset with 
                         one of these in my hand
                              (gestures to her drink)
                         ...and then it starts to rain. And I 
                         wake up and it's my roof leaking on 
                         me. Yeah, I'm also real tired, Bernie.

                                     BERNIE
                              (not even sure why 
                              he's telling her 
                              this)
                         I only got six more days. Well, almost 
                         five really. Then I'll be leaving 
                         town.

                                     NATALIE
                         Only five more days?
                              (a beat)
                         Then we shouldn't waste any more 
                         time.

               Natalie covers Bernie's hand with hers.

                                     NATALIE
                         Why don't we go back to your place?

                                     BERNIE
                              (completely caught 
                              off-guard)
                         I, uh... If this is... I don't know... 
                         I don't know if I can afford...

               Natalie flinches slightly. Then swiftly regains her composure. 
               It's Vegas. An honest mistake.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh god... I'm so sorry... I didn't 
                         mean... You see -- that's exactly 
                         what I'm talking about. I've gone 
                         and "cooled" the damn table.

                                     NATALIE
                         Ah, just shut up, Bernie. You haven't 
                         gone and cooled anything. Not by a 
                         long shot.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Natalie's hand flips on the television. Another bizarre 
               religious service. We pull back from the screen as she tries 
               to change the channel. Just gets a whole lot of static.

               Bernie's standing uncomfortably in the middle of the room.

                                     NATALIE
                         You should complain about this.

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm not here that much. Drink? Sorry, 
                         all I got's gin.

                                     NATALIE
                         Nah. I've had my fill. Go ahead.

               Bernie walks over to the dresser, pours himself a shot.

               Natalie glances around. She notices Bernie's dead plants...

                                     NATALIE
                         You know, once they're dead, they 
                         don't really grow back. In case, 
                         that's what you're waiting for.

               Her eyes land on the empty cat bowl. She's about to say 
               something, when she picks up on Bernie's expression. Let's 
               not even go there. She gestures to an old record player in 
               the corner.

                                     NATALIE
                         So... got any music?

               Bernie opens one of the kitchenette cupboards. Bare shelves... 
               except for a lone RECORD up on top. He brings it down. It's 
               a Sinatra album. Never been opened.

               Natalie looks on as Bernie meticulously removes the record 
               from its sleeve. He blows a few particles of dust from its 
               surface. Then delicately lays it on the turntable. The way 
               he goes about this is incredibly ceremonious. With as much 
               care as given to disarming a nuclear weapon.

               Natalie can't help but smile.

               Bernie lowers the needle to the first cut of the record.

               Everything seems to be going so well, until...

               SKREEEEEE! The needle skids across the surface of the record 
               with a sound worse than chalk on a blackboard.

               Bernie opens his mouth in a silent grimace... and a delicious 
               laugh comes out.

               It's Natalie's laugh. Talk about a tension breaker. Bernie 
               turns to her, shrugs. He tries again. This time the needle 
               catches... and Sinatra takes command of the room. He's singing 
               "This Town," a finger snapping upbeat Valentine to Vegas. 
               Marred only by a slight clicking caused by the scratch.

               Natalie summons Bernie over with her wagging forefinger. He 
               picks up his glass, shuffles over.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sit. Relax. I promise you, at least 
                         one of us has done this before.

                                     BERNIE
                         This is not my first --

                                     NATALIE
                         Sssh. Surprise me.

               She starts massaging his shoulders, eliciting involuntary 
               moans from him. Bernie is almost in tears. Nobody's touched 
               him like this in years. And it shows.

               Natalie takes Bernie's glass, gulps down the remains herself, 
               then sets it on the floor. She drops down next to Bernie.

               Starts kissing him. Takes it slow.

                                     NATALIE
                         You're doing real good.

               They fall back onto the mattress. Natalie taking the reigns, 
               maneuvering her hips, kicking off her panties...

               Bernie gets an eyeful of a tattoo on her butt. A pair of 
               dice. Both twos.

               In seconds, Natalie has separated Bernie from his pants and 
               underwear, taking him inside of her, Ol' Blue Eyes keeping 
               the rhythm...

               Natalie moans uninhibitedly. Surprise: she's a real screamer. 
               Moments later, we hear banging from the hooker's side of the 
               wall. Some John telling them to keep it down.

               Bernie, with tears of elation in his eyes, thrusts away at 
               Natalie... for all of thirty seconds, before he explodes, 
               convulsing in her arms with a stifled gasp.

               Frank winds down "This Town" a few seconds later. Poor Bernie, 
               he didn't even make it through the song.

                                     BERNIE
                         Sorry...

               Natalie wraps her arms around him.

                                     NATALIE
                         Don't worry, Bernie. I've had worse. 
                         We'll try again later.

               Bernie rests his head on her breasts. Closes his eyes. We 
               hold on him. A few seconds pass... and he breaks into a smile.

               Fade to black.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               TIGHT on Bernie sleeping. He still has that goofy smile on 
               his lips. A beat or two later, he opens his eyes. We PULL 
               BACK to reveal that he's alone in the bed. No sign of Natalie.

               Bernie turns to the pillow next to him, buries his face in 
               it. Takes a deep breath. Moans at her scent. Ambrosia. He 
               still has his face in the pillow, sucking in deep breaths, 
               when Natalie steps out of the bathroom. Big smile.

                                     NATALIE
                         Hey, so, you wanna get some breakfast?

               Bernie just looks up at her; replay on the goofy smile.

               Heaven.

                                     BERNIE (V.O.)
                         -- I did six months at Rikers for 
                         running numbers. It was Shelly's 
                         thing, but I took the rap for it.

               INT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - DAY

               Bernie and Natalie sit eating breakfast.

                                     BERNIE
                         After I get out, I call up Shelly 
                         and he tells me to come out here. I 
                         figure he's going to set me up good 
                         at the Shangri-la. But he tells me 
                         they got all these rules about casinos 
                         employing felons. So he gets me this 
                         gig doing telemarketing for one of 
                         their fronts -- trying to scam 
                         pensioners out of their retirement 
                         money. I lasted two weeks.

               As Bernie talks, Natalie spies a very PREGNANT GIRL (20's) 
               coming out of the restroom. Her eyes follow the girl back to 
               a table where a YOUNG MAN (20's) waits on her.

                                     BERNIE
                         Already, I was getting in deep. 
                         Finally it got so bad, I had to beg 
                         Shelly to take on my markers around 
                         town. That just bought me more time 
                         to keep losing. I put Shelly in an 
                         awkward position. I understand why 
                         he did what he did.
                              (taps his knee)

                                     NATALIE
                         He did that to you? What, he shot 
                         you?

                                     BERNIE
                         Baseball bat.
                              (off her cringing 
                              expression)
                         I got off easy.

                                     NATALIE
                         That's getting off easy?

                                     BERNIE
                         I was out of control.

                                     NATALIE
                         But he maimed you...

                                     BERNIE
                         Let me tell you something. I'm 
                         grateful for what he did.
                              (off her stunned look)
                         No kidding. Every time I get an urge 
                         to play off the clock -- to so much 
                         as drop a quarter in a slot -- I 
                         reach down and squeeze what's left 
                         of my cartilage. It's one helluva 
                         reminder.

                                     NATALIE
                         Jesus... I thought stuff like that 
                         didn't happen no more. Like that was 
                         just in the movies or something.

               Bernie holds her gaze her for a moment.

                                     BERNIE
                         Anyway, Shelly and I worked out a 
                         payment plan. Two years off the books 
                         at the Shangri-la, cooling tables. 
                         Five more days and I walk.

               Before Natalie can respond, we hear the pregnant girl start 
               to moan out loud. The waitress rushes over.

                                     PREGNANT GIRL
                              (clutching her belly)
                         Oh shit, I think I'm going into labor!

               The young man at the table rushes her to her feet, escorts 
               her toward the exit in a dramatic fashion. All this without 
               paying the bill.

               As they pass by Bernie and Natalie's table, the girl trips 
               over Natalie's purse. Bernie quickly helps her up. That's 
               when he notices the young man...

                                     BERNIE
                              (shocked)
                         Mikey?

                                     MIKEY
                         Bernie...

               There's a quick moment of confusion. Bernie feels a bit thrown 
               by it all.

               EXT. MOONLIGHTER COFFEE SHOP - PARKING LOT - DAY

               Bernie accompanies them out to their car at a quick step.

               Once out the door, the girl's contractions appear to have 
               subsided. Natalie walks with the girl to try and help.

                                     PREGNANT GIRL
                         I'm OK now. False alarm. Thanks.

               Bernie pulls Mikey aside.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey? Is that...? You're not the...

                                     MIKEY
                              (nods)
                         Bull's eye. One time. Obviously runs 
                         in the family. I guess you're gonna 
                         be a grandfather, Bernie.

               They reach the couple's car. A rusted out 1955 Ford Fairlaine. 
               By the looks of it, they've been living out of it.

                                     BERNIE
                         This you?

                                     MIKEY
                         Hey, what the fuck, it runs. Anyways, 
                         we gotta be somewhere...

                                     BERNIE
                         How's your mom doing?

                                     MIKEY
                         I'm gonna pretend like you give a 
                         shit and tell you, she's getting by. 
                         As long as she's wasted.

               Bernie nods. He gazes past Mikey to the girl.

                                     MIKEY
                         Name's Charlene, in case you were 
                         wondering. Looks like she's carrying 
                         a whole litter in there, don't it?

                                     NATALIE
                         When was the last time you saw a 
                         doctor?

               Charlene sidles up alongside Mikey.

                                     CHARLENE
                         This clinic in Jersey. Maybe six 
                         months ago. I wasn't about to go 
                         back after they treated me like 
                         cattle. Just because I didn't have 
                         no insurance. And those places, 
                         they're crawling with T.B. from all 
                         'em spies.

                                     BERNIE
                         So, you're in town...?

                                     MIKEY
                         Maybe a week or so. Got some business 
                         to take care of.

                                     BERNIE
                         If you want, stop by the Lucky Star 
                         Motel. Give us a chance to catch up. 
                         I'm on three to eleven shift at the 
                         Shangri-la. I work the floor.

                                     MIKEY
                         No shit. Well, how 'bout that? Yeah, 
                         maybe I'll do that. We can play catch 
                         up. For the kid's sake. Gotta split.

                                     NATALIE
                              (to Charlene)
                         Take care.

               Mikey helps Charlene into the front passenger seat. They 
               drive off. Natalie looks to Bernie. She's curious, but doesn't 
               ask. He appears thankful for that.

               INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLES - NIGHT

               CLOSE on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the 
               felt. We see the owner of the chips strike a match. His last 
               one. It fizzles out quickly. TILT UP to the PLAYER'S FACE 
               with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips.

               A hand quickly reaches in, lights the cigarette with a Zippo.

               PULL BACK to reveal Bernie.

                                     PLAYER
                         Thanks...

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't mention it.

               Bernie sits at the table.

                                     DEALER
                              (he knows the routine)
                         Hundred dollar minimum here, sir.

               Bernie peels off a hundred from his billfold. Lays it on the 
               felt.

                                     DEALER
                         Money plays one hundred.

                                     PLAYER
                              (to Bernie)
                         No offense, pal, but there's twenty 
                         other tables. What do you wanna come 
                         sit on my head for?

                                     BERNIE
                         Just wanna play one hand. Feeling 
                         lucky tonight. I got this voice in 
                         my head, says this is the table...

                                     PLAYER
                         I know this is the table. I'm already 
                         doing good here. It's my fucking 
                         table --

                                     BERNIE
                              (touching him)
                         Hey, heard the one about the fella 
                         walks into a bar and says, "Hey, who 
                         owns that big great dane outside?" A 
                         man at the end of the bar raises his 
                         hand. "I do." The fella says, "Yeah? 
                         Well, my dog just killed it."

               The dealer finishes shuffling, begins to deal.

                                     BERNIE
                         "Whaddya mean your dog just killed 
                         my great dane? What kinda dog you 
                         have?" The fella just shrugs and 
                         says, "A chihuahua." "You tellin' me 
                         your chihuahua just killed my great 
                         dane? How?"
                              (a beat)
                         "I dunno," the fella says, "I think 
                         he got stuck in his throat."

               Bernie starts laughing. The player is less than tickled.

               Just then the dealer interrupts them.

                                     DEALER
                         Insurance?

               We see the dealer's got an ace showing.

                                     PLAYER
                         God damnit!

               The player waves off the insurance, as does Bernie. The dealer 
               checks. Nothing. As the hand plays through the dealer busts 
               out. Bernie glances over at the dealer. What the hell? Bernie 
               places his chips again.

                                     PLAYER
                         You said, one hand.

                                     BERNIE
                              (agitated; to dealer)
                         Keep going.

               The dealer plays. Bernie and the high roller win again.

               Bernie glances around him uncomfortably. We see Shelly 
               approaching. Shelly just has a nose for when things aren't 
               running smoothly. Larry is lurking behind him.

               The dealer turns up some cards. And again, Bernie and the 
               high roller win. Bernie looks absolutely perturbed. Shelly 
               gestures something with his head. Bernie cashes out.

                                     PLAYER
                         Hey, stick around, pal. You and me, 
                         we make a great team.

               Bernie strolls over to Shelly. Shelly guides him away from 
               the table under Larry's watchful eye.

                                     SHELLY
                         What was that?

               Bernie shrugs, still confused.

                                     SHELLY
                         Well, what fucking gives? Is it 
                         McGann? He's been with us twelve 
                         years. The man's as standup as my 
                         dick.
                              (thinking to himself)
                         Maybe he's got money problems. I'm 
                         gonna pull him. He wasn't counting 
                         'em, was he? The mook with the streak?

               Bernie shakes his head. Larry sidles over.

                                     LARRY
                         Is there a problem?

                                     SHELLY
                              (zero tolerance)
                         No, there's no problem. Fella's on a 
                         streak, is all.

                                     LARRY
                              (re: Bernie)
                         Let me guess? This is one of your 
                         "coolers?"

                                     SHELLY
                         Why don't you announce it to the 
                         whole fucking joint?

                                     LARRY
                              (lowers his voice)
                         Man, they told me you were a stickler 
                         for the old ways. But coolers? What 
                         is this guy, some kind of degenerate 
                         gambler? Reformed card shark? He 
                         doesn't look too effective to me.

                                     SHELLY
                         He's the best. Take it from me.

                                     LARRY
                         Sure. Whatever. But there ways -- 
                         subtle ways -- to keep things in our 
                         favor. I'm talking more forward 
                         thinking methods.

                                     SHELLY
                         That right? I suppose you got a whole 
                         fucking prospectus on the subject.

                                     LARRY
                         As a matter of fact I do. Like, right 
                         off the bat, I can tell you this 
                         wallpaper isn't going to cut it. 
                         It's too uplifting. I would go with 
                         more muted tones.

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah? Wallpaper?

                                     LARRY
                         And personally, I think the waitresses 
                         can all pop another button or two. 
                         Myself, I wouldn't hire anything 
                         less than a C cup.

               Shelly looks to Bernie. You believe this mook? Larry extracts 
               a CD from his jacket...

                                     LARRY
                         Know what this is? Music to be sure. 
                         Pleasant, non-intrusive. But blended 
                         in at a subsonic level is a mantra. 
                         "Lose... lose... lose." And that's 
                         just skimming the surface. We really 
                         need to talk, Shelly.

               Shelly is close to losing it. When MORRIE, the manager of 
               the Paradise, comes running up...

                                     MORRIE
                         Shelly, you better come quick.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

               Shelly, Larry and Bernie following behind Morrie as he hastily 
               leads them down a hallway of the Shangri-la's best suites. 
               They arrive at an open door, the sound of a TELEVISION 
               beckoning them inside...

               INT. BUDDY STAFFORD'S SUITE - NIGHT

               Starting on the TV set: "Lost Horizon" (1937) is playing.

               It's the scene where Robert Conway (Ronald Coleman), his 
               brother and Maria are leaving the lost city in the end.

               Conway looks back for one last tearful view of paradise.

               PANNING OFF THE SCREEN to a pair of naked feet on the floor 
               next to the bed... revealing Buddy slumped against the side 
               of the mattress... a hypodermic needle protruding from his 
               arm. Death glaze fixated on the screen.

               Bernie slumps back against the wall. Catches his breath.

               Shelly just stares at Buddy, a slight tremor of grief 
               threatening his granite features. He glances over at Larry, 
               who takes in Buddy's deathly repose without a hint of emotion. 
               Larry meets Shelly's eye with a subtle smirk of one-upmanship.

               An incendiary beat passes between them. Then...

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Morrie)
                         Get a hold of his daughter. Assist 
                         her with the arrangements. The Shangri-
                         la will take care of everything.

                                     MORRIE
                         What about the Paradise?

                                     SHELLY
                         She goes dark tonight.

                                     LARRY
                         That won't be necessary.

               Shelly and Larry exchange looks again. Bernie picks up on 
               it. The tension in the room threatens nuclear fission. A 
               loud ANIMAL ROAR reverberates on the soundtrack...

               accompanied by jungle-like percussion... as we CUT TO:

               INT. THE PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               A "now performing" poster on a metal stand: JOHNNY CAPPELLA 
               live at the Paradise Lounge!

               PANNING off the sign and following a COUPLE through the doors 
               into the theater.

               ...our eye drawn to the stage. A troupe of gorgeous FEMALE 
               DANCERS in leopard print G-strings, grinding their hips to 
               the muscular rhythm.

               Flanking them are a pair of strutting LIONS in elevated cages.

               An EXPLOSION OF LIGHT and SMOKE... and JOHNNY CAPPELLA makes 
               his entrance. Decked out in a reflective suit that picks up 
               every light in the house and throws it back at the audience.

               Johnny's got the style of a Harry Connick Jr. and the moves 
               of Ricki Martin. The energy this guy brings to the stage 
               makes the last twenty years of Buddy Stafford's reign seem 
               like suspended animation. The women in the audience start 
               fanning themselves with delight.

               It's a new dawn in Paradise. And the panties are coming fast 
               and furious.

               We see Shelly watching from the back of the room. He shifts 
               his attention to Nicky, Larry and Marty at a primo table.

               They're having a grand time. Nicky pats Larry on the back of 
               the head. "Good work, kid."

               Larry turns and raises his drink to Shelly. Shelly stares 
               right through him. A declaration of war.

               INT. CASINO MIDWAY - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie wander around the midway. A middle-aged 
               WORKER at the ring toss booth gets her attention.

                                     RING TOSS WORKER
                         Over here, young lady! C'mon, give 
                         it a try. Eight for a dollar.

               Natalie drags Bernie over. She pays her money and the worker 
               hands her the rings. Natalie throws, and misses all eight.

               The man pats her on the shoulder.

                                     RING TOSS WORKER
                         Sorry there, sweetheart. Better luck 
                         next time. Wanna try again?

               Natalie is about to take him up on it, when she catches 
               Bernie's eye. His look suggests she's being played for a 
               sucker. She decides against it.

               They walk off down the midway. Bernie chuckles to himself.

                                     NATALIE
                         What?

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing.

                                     NATALIE
                         What?

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing. You're just an easy mark, 
                         is all.

                                     NATALIE
                         An easy mark?

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah. Easy mark. You never heard 
                         that term?

               Natalie shakes her head.

                                     BERNIE
                         When we were kids, Shelly and me, we 
                         used to work Coney Island during the 
                         summer. When a guy would walk up and 
                         seemed eager to open his wallet, we 
                         would always mark him with chalk. 
                         We'd pat him on the back or arm with 
                         the chalk. Like, 'Hey buddy, good 
                         job!'
                              (pats Natalie)
                         Meanwhile, he had no clue the other 
                         guys saw him coming a mile away. 
                         Easy mark.

               Natalie looks down at her shoulder where the man patted her.

               She brushes it for effect. Bernie smiles. They take a seat 
               at the end of the midway.

               Natalie locks onto a little toe-headed BOY being dragged 
               around by his OLDER BROTHER and the brother's FRIEND. The 
               kid has a glazed look in his eyes.

               Natalie fixates on the boy with a haunted expression. Bernie 
               picks up on it.

                                     BERNIE
                         You OK?

                                     NATALIE
                         You notice last night, that tattoo 
                         on my butt?

                                     BERNIE
                              (are you kidding?!)
                         Little Joe.

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah, two twos. Little Joe.

               Natalie hides her face behind her soda cup. Looks off in the 
               distance.

                                     NATALIE
                         I had a son. His name was Joe. I was 
                         his mother for a year.

                                     BERNIE
                         You know, you don't have to tell me 
                         this.

                                     NATALIE
                         I want to, Bernie. Better you know 
                         the worst of me up front. Later, 
                         when I'm already invested in you, 
                         it'll be too hard to come clean. 
                         After I tell you this, you'll 
                         probably... I mean, I'll understand.

               She tears her eyes away from Bernie. Bernie can't believe 
               what he's hearing. That she wants to be invested in him.

               What could be so bad?

                                     NATALIE
                         I gave my son up for adoption. I 
                         just wanted my life back. I was 
                         seventeen going on eighteen and I 
                         was selfish. My family, they didn't 
                         want to have nothing to do with me 
                         after that. So I hitched a ride out 
                         here. Figured I could make it as a 
                         showgirl. Ten years later...
                              (shrugs; starts to 
                              break up)
                         I like to think that if it happened 
                         when I was older -- with some guy I 
                         cared about -- maybe things would 
                         have been different. I think about 
                         my Little Joe. And, I do know he's 
                         better off. I'm convinced of that.

               She lowers her soda. Turns to Bernie. He studies her for a 
               lengthy beat, stoic features. She wipes away her tears. Oh 
               well, that's that. Bernie stands up. Looks around... focuses 
               on the arcade clock. It reads 1:40 a.m. He turns to her...

                                     BERNIE
                         So, you wanna go try your hand at 
                         the dime pitch? It's early still.

               Off Natalie's tear-filled features. She breaks into a laugh-
               cry...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie making love. Slow, tender. Natalie doesn't 
               make with the "Oh yeah, baby, you're doing great" 
               encouragement. Just some low key moans. Bernie doesn't come 
               too soon either. He outlasts Sinatra through several cuts.

               In contrast, we hear the hooker and her John howling away 
               through the walls. An escalating ostinato of "Oh Baby's."

               Until Natalie reaches behind her and raps her fist against 
               the wall. Big smile from both of them.

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY

               Bernie and Natalie returning from breakfast in Bernie's Buick. 
               Bernie can't find a parking spot. Natalie climbs out, heads 
               for the room.

               Natalie arrives at the room. She's about to stab the key in 
               the lock, when she realizes the door is ajar. She hesitates 
               for a moment, then pushes it open...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               ...to find Mikey and Charlene waiting on them. Charlene is 
               puffing away on a Marlboro when Natalie enters. She 
               immediately stubs it out. Rises, heads for the bathroom.

                                     CHARLENE
                         I gotta go pee. I'm always peeing.

               She closes the door after her.

                                     NATALIE
                              (to Mikey)
                         How did you get in here?

                                     MIKEY
                         I told the desk clerk Bernie was my 
                         old man. He let us wait inside. That 
                         a problem?

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie's looking for a parking space.

                                     MIKEY
                              (chuckles)
                         Shit. I musta taken the last one.

               Mikey steps up to Natalie. She hasn't moved from the doorway. 
               Her dislike for Mikey is evident.

                                     MIKEY
                         Tell me something, Natalie? Is he 
                         paying you?

                                     NATALIE
                         Excuse me?

                                     MIKEY
                         My old man, is he renting your ass? 
                         'Cause otherwise I just don't get 
                         it. A loser like my pops in the 
                         company of some primo T & A. It don't 
                         compute.

               Natalie doesn't dignify Mikey with an answer. She stares him 
               down unflinchingly. Mikey reaches out to Natalie's ear, 
               "pulls" out a $20 dollar chip.

                                     MIKEY
                         This enough to get me a taste? Family 
                         discount?

               He drops the chip down Natalie's cleavage. Natalie still 
               doesn't react. Mikey reaches up, starts caressing her face.

               She flinches. Right then, the door swings open. Bernie enters. 
               Mikey snaps his fingers and a rose appears in his hand. He 
               extends it to Natalie. She ignores the gesture, steps aside.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey...

                                     MIKEY
                         Hey, Bernie. I told you I was gonna 
                         stop by.

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah... I figured you'd call ahead. 
                         We were out at breakfast.

               Charlene emerges from the bathroom. Natalie heads over. She 
               doesn't want to be around Mikey.

               She stops in front of Charlene, points to a sprinkling of 
               white powder on the side of her nose.

                                     NATALIE
                         You missed some.

               Charlene immediately swats the coke off. Natalie enters the 
               bathroom. Closes the door.

                                     MIKEY
                         You see, the thing is, Bernie, we're 
                         kinda strapped. I mean, Charly here's 
                         expecting like yesterday, and we 
                         don't have the dough to make with 
                         the right nutrition for her an' all. 
                         So, I was wondering if you would 
                         care to invest a little in your 
                         grandchild's future... his well being.

               Bernie scratches his head, thinks on it for a moment or two.

               Then heads over to the kitchenette cupboard. Pulls down a 
               coffee can. Extracts a thick wad of bills. Hands them over 
               to Mikey.

                                     BERNIE
                         There's about three grand there. 
                         That's all I got.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Bless you, Bernie.
                              (pats her belly)
                         You know, Michael, I  -- think we 
                         should name her Bernadette. After 
                         your father.

                                     MIKEY
                         You mean, Bernie. Trust me, it's a 
                         boy.

               Bernie seems quite moved by it all.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (to Bernie)
                         Wanna feel her?

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think... I don't want anything 
                         to hap...

                                     CHARLENE
                         Ooh, I just felt her kick. C'mon, 
                         Bernie, gimme your hand...

               She places Bernie's hand over her stomach.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Feel that?

                                     BERNIE
                              (not sure)
                         I don't know... I think so...

               Mikey takes Charlene by the arm...

                                     MIKEY
                         We'll catch you later, Bernie. I 
                         think I'm gonna take Charly over to 
                         the hospital right now. Get her 
                         checked up real good.

               Charlene kisses Bernie on the cheek. He blushes.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Take care, Pop.

                                     BERNIE
                         Mikey...

               Mikey turns in the doorway, eyebrows raised. Yeah?

                                     BERNIE
                         You're not going to try anything 
                         stupid while you're in town?

               Mikey plays it dumb. Huh?

                                     BERNIE
                         You mess up and they'll cut you no 
                         slack. That's all I'm saying. You 
                         got a kid to think about.

               Mikey nods, backs out of the room. Charlene giggles. They 
               disappear into the parking lot. Natalie emerges from the 
               bathroom. She lights up a cigarette, just stares at him as 
               if to say: sucker. Bernie shrugs.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Shelly enters to find Larry seated behind his desk. Larry 
               immediately leaps to his feet, phony apologetic grin.

               Nicky and Marty are lounging on Shelly's sofa. Shelly's gaze 
               is drawn to a table in the middle of the room. There's 
               something on it, covered in a plastic sheet. He raises a 
               "what gives?" eyebrow.

                                     NICKY
                         Shelly, I hope you don't mind...

                                     SHELLY
                         What's going on, Nicky?

                                     NICKY
                         I'm sorry we didn't say nothing about 
                         this earlier... but the deal wasn't 
                         closed yet.

                                     MARTY
                         Don't worry, Shelly, you're gonna 
                         love it.

               Nicky gestures to Larry. Larry whisks the plastic sheet off 
               the table...

               ...to reveal an impressive SCALE MODEL of a redesigned SHANGRI-
               LA HOTEL AND CASINO.

               The model boasts huge snow-capped Himalayan peaks a la "Lost 
               Horizon," surrounding a completely overhauled hotel and 
               casino. A Matterhorn-like rollercoaster traverses the mountain 
               top. Gold and marbled pillars, terraces and floors promise 
               to raise the bar on Las Vegas opulence. We're looking at a 
               hundred million dollar investment easy.

                                     NICKY
                         The new Shangri-la Hotel and Casino. 
                         We break ground on her in six months.

               Off Shelly's startled expression --

                                     NICKY
                         I know what you're thinking? Where's 
                         she gonna go? You need space to 
                         expand, right? Well, that's been 
                         taken care of. We're now the proud 
                         owners of The Golden Frontier next 
                         door.

                                     LARRY
                              (gesturing to the 
                              model)
                         She's perfect. Three floors of gaming, 
                         IMAX theater, entertainment center, 
                         boutiques, restaurants, rollercoaster, 
                         you name it. She'll pay for herself 
                         in three years, and then it's easy 
                         money.

                                     NICKY
                         Isn't she great, Shell?

               Shelly slowly approaches the model like a condemned prisoner 
               mounting the scaffolding.

               We see his stoic features reflected in her sparkling swimming 
               pool.

                                     SHELLY
                         In "Lost Horizon," these people, 
                         their plane crashes in the Himalayas -- 
                         and they get rescued and taken to 
                         this Utopia in the mountains. Shangri-
                         la. It's beautiful. The place is 
                         completely isolated. Untouched by 
                         the outside world. There's no war, 
                         no greed, no bullshit... Time is 
                         slowed down. People, they don't age. 
                         It's... paradise. That's what Shangri-
                         la is. Paradise.

                                     LARRY
                         Yeah, we've all seen the movie. And 
                         your point is?

               Shelly whirls around, yells:

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't fuck with paradise! All'a 
                         ya!

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, Jesus, c'mon, Shelly. We're not 
                         trying to fuck with it. We're trying 
                         to make it better.

                                     SHELLY
                         How... how, Nicky, could it be any 
                         better? Right now it's perfect. It's 
                         the last of its kind. It's pure... 
                         and this.
                              (points to the model; 
                              weary)
                         ...this is just... it's a mockery. 
                         An insult. Trying to make something 
                         of it that it isn't.

                                     LARRY
                         What are you talking about? It's 
                         right outta the movie?

                                     SHELLY
                         Whose talking about a fuckin' movie? 
                         This ain't a fuckin' movie. This is 
                         my life. This is my house of worship. 
                         You people are shittin' on all that's 
                         sacred to me.

               A tense silence ensues. Nicky, Larry and Marty exchange looks.

                                     SHELLY
                              (tired laugh)
                         I got just one question? Where you 
                         gonna be when they decide to change 
                         it back? When the people, they come 
                         looking for the real Vegas, from 
                         before all this Epcott Center 
                         bullshit. Who's gonna it give it to 
                         them? You guys? I don't think so. 
                         You know who? The same fucks who 
                         started this shit in the first place. 
                         It's all gonna come full circle and 
                         bite you in the ass. Mark my words.

               Shelly falls silent. Massages his forehead. Shit, that wasn't 
               the way to handle it.

               Nicky gets up from the sofa, walks over to Shelly, places a 
               hand on his shoulder. Shelly flinches, but doesn't pull away.

                                     NICKY
                         You make some good points, Shelly. 
                         Maybe it'll swing back the other 
                         way, who knows? But the smart money 
                         suggests we roll the dice. I'm not 
                         gonna bullshit you; naturally there's 
                         gonna be a lot of restructuring in 
                         the months to come, but I want you 
                         to know, you'll always have a place 
                         with us.

                                     SHELLY
                         Where's that? Behind the bar?

                                     MARTY
                              (laughs)
                         Behind the bar, that's a good one.

                                     NICKY
                         I think you should take some time 
                         and think things through. All this, 
                         it's a lot to digest, y'know.

                                     MARTY
                         Speaking of things to digest, I'm 
                         starving. How's that buffet they got 
                         in the Valley of the Blue Moon? You 
                         recommend their prime rib, Shell?

               Shelly stares right through Marty. Choke and die on it, 
               motherfucker.

                                     SHELLY
                         It's food.

                                     NICKY
                         Hey, my arteries can use a workout. 
                         Lead us to the trough, Shell.

               Shelly nods at Nicky, then shifts his gaze to Larry. Larry's 
               all smiles. He steps forward to join them, his hand dropping 
               down and caressing the surface of Shelly's desk behind him.

               A subtle gesture not lost on Shelly. Shelly mentally unloads 
               a full chamber into Larry's chest. Returns the smile.

               INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               As Shelly and the group pass a hot craps table, Nicky is 
               drawn to it.

                                     NICKY
                         Wait up a second...

                                     MARTY
                         I thought we were gonna eat?

               Only now do we see Bernie has arrived to cool the table of 
               its hot shooter -- A LOUD, pudgy, overdressed SUBURBANITE.

               Shelly eyes Bernie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Maybe we wanna play over there. Less 
                         crowded.

                                     NICKY
                         Nah, let's play here. This is my 
                         lucky table. I always play here.
                              (to the others)
                         Go on ahead. I know where to find 
                         you guys.

               Shelly signals Bernie to back off. Bernie steps back.

               Shelly, Larry and Marty head for the restaurant. Nicky quickly 
               slaps down some green.

               The stickman slides the dice over to the suburbanite who is 
               shooting. He scuttles the dice. They bounce up over the rail 
               and spike Nicky on the forehead before dropping back on the 
               felt. The players chuckle.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Out! Seven, line away seven...

               Nicky rubs his forehead, glares at the suburbanite. He fires 
               back.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         C"mon, pops! What the hell? I coulda 
                         paid my mortgage with the money I 
                         just lost.

               Nicky says nothing. The table is quickly cleared by the 
               dealers. The stickman skips the next shooter and feeds the 
               dice to Nicky.

                                     SHOOTER
                         Hey? I'm supposed to be next...

                                     NICKY
                         File a grievance, shithead.

               Suburbanite is still fuming over his loss. Nicky places a 
               couple hundred on the passline.

                                     STICKMAN
                         We're coming out. Crap Eleven, any 
                         seven.

               Nicky throws in some chips to the center.

                                     NICKY
                         Hundred dollar big red.

               Suburbanite watches as Nicky runs through a lengthy pre-shot 
               routine. Lots of hand jive and cuff shooting.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Hurry it up, gramps. Your soup's 
                         getting cold.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Crap, Ace Deuce. Line down.

               The croupiers takes down the pass line.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Hey, Busketti, maybe you should try 
                         shuffleboard.

               Nicky is fed the dice again. Same routine. Nicky just fires 
               an incendiary look back at the suburbanite.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Uncle Palsy? Shake'em this direction.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Four, hard four. The point is four.

               The players make their bets.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Good now throw it before you fucking 
                         keel over and die, old man.

               Nicky slowly starts his routine defiantly.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Happy birthday to me. Happy Birthday 
                         to me... Jesus, fuck, I'm another 
                         year older already.

               Nicky throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         OUT! Seven! Line away.

               Nicky claps his hands dealer style -- for effect -- and with 
               a gentlemanly smile steps back from the table. Nicky's chips 
               are quickly swept up by the croupier.

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Don't take it so hard, pops. Everybody 
                         craps out.

               Nicky locks eyes with the suburbanite. Then flashes a smile 
               that suggests he's going to brush it off. He turns away from 
               the table...

                                     SUBURBANITE
                         Now go change your fucking Depends.

               Nicky makes like it's all in good jest. Yeah, that's real 
               cute. He heads around the table to the suburbanite, holds 
               out his hand as if to say: Hey, no hard feelings. The 
               suburbanite shrugs. What the fuck? I was just playing with 
               you, pops. He reaches for Nicky's hand... when Nicky suddenly 
               headbutts him. Before anyone can react, Nicky starts laying 
               into the suburbanite. The man goes down and.

               Nicky continues pummeling him...

                                     NICKY
                         Who's laughing now, huh? ya fuckin! 
                         prick! C'mon, crack wise again... Ya 
                         fuckin' smooth as a Ken doll, no-
                         dick, suburbanite scum. How's that 
                         for a game?!

               Shelly alerted to the fracas, rushes back to the table. He 
               takes immediate control of the situation. Snaps his fingers 
               at security. The suburbanite is whisked away with a pocketful 
               of comps and a bruised ego. Shelly takes Nicky aside, attempts 
               to calm him. Nicky keeps railing at Shelly:

                                     NICKY
                         That ain't right, Shelly! Guy fucks 
                         up my game like that. Who the fuck 
                         does he think he is?

                                     SHELLY
                         You're right. He's just a piece of 
                         shit. Forget about him.

                                     NICKY
                         I thought this joint had more class. 
                         Used to be, we wouldn't even let 
                         bums like that in...

               Nicky catches himself. He looks at Shelly for a beat.

               There's an unspoken understanding between them. "The good 
               old days." We see Bernie in the b.g., looking more than a 
               bit shocked.

               INT. THE MAKAWAO BAR AND GRILL - NIGHT

               Bernie seated with Natalie.

                                     BERNIE
                         This town... You know, Natalie, all 
                         I want to do is go some place where 
                         I can tell day from night. Where 
                         they got clocks on the wall. I can't 
                         breathe around here no more. Four 
                         days and I'm gone. I'm not even sure 
                         I can hold out that long.

                                     NATALIE
                              (a beat)
                         So where does that leave us?

                                     BERNIE
                         A week ago, I didn't remember what 
                         it was like to have a woman's hands 
                         on me. I'm still pinching myself, 
                         expecting to wake-up from...
                              (just blurts it out)
                         Come with me, Natalie. I want you to 
                         come with me.

                                     NATALIE
                         God, Bernie, that's...

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spring 
                         that on you.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie... I want to be with you. I 
                         do. But I don't know if I can leave 
                         with you.

               Bernie's look: Why?

                                     NATALIE
                         I was working on a compatibility 
                         chart for the two of us. And it looks 
                         good, really, it does.

                                     BERNIE
                         So, what's the problem?

                                     NATALIE
                         That's with us here. In Vegas.

               Bernie's expression: Oh.

                                     NATALIE
                         Maybe I was being presumptuous, 'cause 
                         I knew you were leaving... and I 
                         tried working it in different ways... 
                         It wasn't good, Bernie. I got scared. 
                         But that's just for now, for the 
                         immediate future. Once the planets 
                         realign, maybe a year from now...

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie... I can't... Not another 
                         year. Not another week.

               A somber mood falls on the table. Bernie reaches for Natalie's 
               hand. Instead, he knocks the salt over. It spills out in 
               front of them.

                                     BERNIE
                         I think... we probably shouldn't see 
                         each other anymore.

                                     NATALIE
                         Why, Bernie? We only got a couple 
                         days left together. Why not make the 
                         most of them?

                                     BERNIE
                              (a long beat)
                         Because if I spend one more night in 
                         your arms, I'm not going anywhere.

                                     NATALIE
                         And that's so bad?

               Bernie just stares at her, shrouded in sadness. Natalie stubs 
               out her cigarette, rises.

                                     NATALIE
                         Take care, Bernie.

               Bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front 
               of him. Nods. A few beats later he raises his head...

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie, don't...

               Gone. A WAITRESS appears.

                                     WAITRESS (O.S.)
                         Get you another?

                                     BERNIE
                              (nods)
                         I think you better bring me the 
                         bottle. Please.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO/BAR - NIGHT

               Once again, we see Bernie's feet limp across the casino floor. 
               He walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of coffee.

               Doris brings it over. Short on the cream again.

               He just sips it black. Gloom and doom features. Life sucks.

               His master's VOICE sounds over the intercom:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Chang, party of fifteen, your table 
                         is ready, Chang party of fifteen.

               Bernie looks to Doris. Sighs. Only three more days.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               He heads for the crap tables, the sound of raucous CHEERING 
               becomes audible. A large crowd starting to gather.

               Bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd. As soon as 
               he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table, he tenses 
               up.

               Oh shit.

               It's MIKEY. With Charlene. Charlene is making one hell of a 
               racket. Playing up her extremely maternal state.

               Just then Natalie sidles up to Bernie with the Chivas Regal.

               Without thinking about it, he grabs the glass off the tray, 
               downs it in a single gulp.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (clutching her tummy)
                         Come on, Mikey. This is our future. 
                         Don't blow it.

               Mikey throws down a bet for the dealer.

                                     MIKEY
                         Put this on the line for the boys.

               The stickman thanks him as they place the bet. Mikey throws 
               down more money. We can see Mikey has bets all over the table.

                                     MIKEY
                         With shoes!

                                     STICKMAN
                         Dealer's got shoes. Hands high, the 
                         dice are out! The point is nine.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Come on all you's. Put a good thought 
                         in for our baby!

               As everyone dotes over Charlene, Mikey quickly swaps the 
               dice before anyone can see. He throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six the hard way!

               Mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier, as is Charlene.

               Bernie stands frozen. He doesn't bother trying to get any 
               closer to the table. He knows it'll do no good.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh my god, I just felt him kick! He 
                         knows. He knows you're all pulling 
                         for him. God bless you all.

               Natalie looks over at Charlene. Their eyes meet for a second. 
               It's as though Natalie knows it's a scam and Charlene's 
               acknowledging it.

               Mikey throws again.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six the hard way! Look out, we got a 
                         shooter!

               Another nine grand. Mikey's rail is nearly full. Charlene 
               hops around awkwardly causing more distraction.

               Bernie is really sweating it out now. Then Shelly arrives.

               Larry is hot on his tail.

                                     SHELLY
                         How much?

                                     BERNIE
                         Eighteen thousand since I stepped 
                         up. I'm sorry, Shelly, I guess I've 
                         been hit and miss lately.

               Shelly's expression tells us he isn't so sure. Something 
               definitely isn't kosher.

               As Charlene chatters on, Mikey switches the dice back.

               Shelly makes him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (sotto)
                         Fucking amateurs...

               Mikey throws...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Seven out! Line away.

               The players and crowd, though disappointed, applaud Mikey's 
               achievement.

                                     MIKEY
                              (bowing)
                         I thank you. My wife thanks you. My 
                         unborn child thanks you.

               Mikey moves his rail of chips to the felt.

                                     MIKEY
                         Color me up will ya?

               Larry notices Shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves.

                                     LARRY
                         You've gotta be kidding me.
                              (off Shelly's steely 
                              glare)
                         That's not how I propose we handle 
                         it. We'll turn the matter over to 
                         the authorities. They'll be 
                         blacklisted, their credit ruined...

                                     SHELLY
                              (gets in Larry's face)
                         And then we'll give 'em both a 
                         lollipop for the ride home. Come 
                         watch and learn, Harvard. A little 
                         lesson on how to protect your 
                         investment -- the old school way.

               Shelly walks over to Mikey and Charlene, Larry lingering 
               behind him.

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, that was some run you had back 
                         there.

                                     MIKEY
                         Uh, thanks. Just lucky I guess.

               Mikey steals a tense glance at Charlene. She starts to fidget 
               nervously.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why don't we go do this in my office? 
                         I don't like to hand out all this 
                         amount of cash on the floor.

               Security (Tony and Lou) corrals the couple. Leads them away.

               Bernie watches as they pass by. Mikey looks into Bernie's 
               eyes. They both know he's been made. Natalie doesn't say 
               anything, just looks at Bernie.

               INT. CASINO RECEIVING AREA - NIGHT

               Slot machines everywhere -- some on the way out, some on the 
               way in. Crates of casino supplies.

               Bernie rushes in with Natalie behind him. Heading for an 
               aural beacon of BLOWS landing on flesh... GRUNTING, 
               PLEADING...

               ...arriving to find Tony and Lou kicking the shit out of 
               Mikey on the floor. Charlene lies clutching her belly a few 
               feet away. Shelly swings a baseball bat, warming up for some 
               blood sport. Larry watches from the sidelines -- at once 
               appalled and enthralled.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh my God... I can feel the 
                         contractions coming on...

               Bernie rushes over to Shelly...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, stop them! Don't do this!

                                     SHELLY
                         Get lost, Bernie, this got nothing 
                         to do with you.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's got everything to do with me. 
                         He's my son.

               Everyone stops dead. Freeze frame. Shelly gets a weird look 
               in his eye. A fuse has just been lit...

                                     SHELLY
                         What did you say?

                                     BERNIE
                         I said, he's my --

                                     SHELLY
                         Who? This little prick?

               Shelly smashes Mikey across the shoulder with the bat.

               AARRRGGGGHHH!!! Shelly raises the bat to cream Mikey again... 
               Bernie grabs Shelly's arm. Shelly shoves him back.

               Raises the bat again...

                                     MIKEY
                         Pop, help me...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, don't you fucking do it!

               Shelly freezes. He lowers the bat, throws it aside. Grabs 
               Bernie by his collar...

                                     SHELLY
                         Were you in on this? Jesus, you better 
                         come clean with me.

                                     BERNIE
                         NO! God, no! I didn't know nothing 
                         about it.

               Shelly releases Bernie. There's a strange look in Shelly's 
               eye. We see the wheels turning...

                                     SHELLY
                         How much you think their lives are 
                         worth, Bernie? Myself, I don't think 
                         they're worth piss. But, hey, it 
                         ain't my kid...

               Bernie sees where Shelly's going with this. We can almost 
               hear the cell door slamming in his head.

                                     SHELLY
                         Let me see: they were up almost a 
                         hundred and fifty grand. That's 150 
                         G's someone's gonna have to account 
                         for. What do you say, Bernie, seventy-
                         five grand a piece?

               Bernie glances over at Natalie. She has tears in her eyes.

               He looks to Shelly pleadingly. Please don't do this...

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, I know you don't have that kind 
                         of cash. But, since you're a friend 
                         of the house, I'm willing to front 
                         you.

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, they didn't get away with 
                         the money... You didn't lose 
                         anything...

               Shelly glances over at Lou, nods. Lou kicks Mikey in the 
               face. His nose snaps like a twig.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh Jesus... Yes! All right. It's on 
                         me. 150 G's.

               Charlene clutches her belly, moans...

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh god, oh god... you gotta get me 
                         to the hospital... contractions...

                                     BERNIE
                         Shelly, please help her. That's my 
                         grandson...

                                     SHELLY
                         Hey, why don't we all break out the 
                         champagne? Lootz is about to become 
                         a granddaddy.
                              (walks over to her)
                         How you doin' there, sweetheart? 
                         Must hurt like crap, huh?

                                     CHARLENE
                              (nods)
                         Hurts so bad...

                                     SHELLY
                         Yeah?

               Suddenly Shelly kicks Charlene in the belly! WHAM! She 
               screeches out.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh God...

                                     BERNIE
                         Jesus NOOOOO!!!

               Even Shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed. 
               Larry is aghast. Bernie rushes Shelly, starts raining blows 
               on him. Shelly swats him off. He drops down next to the 
               squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her 
               stomach...

               ...to reveal a mound of fake padding. He tears the padding 
               away from her, throws it at Bernie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Here! It's a fuckin' boy. Anyone got 
                         a cigar?

               The muscle start laughing it up. Relief. Larry emits a nervous 
               giggle. Natalie's jaw hits the floor. Bernie takes a step 
               back. He's about to go into serious shock. Charlene curls 
               over, sobbing.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Bernie)
                         You sure you still want to be good 
                         for it? Because if you want to change 
                         your mind, I don't blame you.

               Bernie looks over at Mikey. He stares up at his father, 
               trembling.

                                     MIKEY
                         I'll make it up to you, Pop, I 
                         swear...

               Bernie holds his son's gaze for a beat. He's almost tempted 
               to... He just shrugs and nods at Shelly.

                                     BERNIE
                         It's on me.

                                     SHELLY
                              (shakes his head)
                         That's the worst fucking call you 
                         ever made in your life.

               ON NATALIE at that moment. We can tell she agrees with 
               Shelly... but thinks all the more of Bernie for it. That 
               might even be love in her eyes.

               Shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor. Walks 
               over to Mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing 
               Mikey's left kneecap. Oh man, the scream...

                                     BERNIE
                         What are you doing?! I thought we 
                         had --

                                     SHELLY
                         150 G's buys their lives. This is 
                         just a little slap on the wrist to 
                         remember me by.

               Natalie turns her head. She's about to throw up. Larry 
               watches, unflinchingly. Charlene is making with some serious 
               pleading now.

                                     CHARLENE
                         Oh god... it wasn't my idea.

               Shelly steps up to Charlene, tapping the base of the bat in 
               the palm of his hand. He smiles reassuringly at her.

                                     SHELLY
                         You know, motherhood is a beautiful 
                         thing. This... you made a mockery 
                         out of it. Maybe you'll get to 
                         experience it for real one day.

                                     CHARLENE
                              (nods, sobbing)
                         I want... to be a mother... please 
                         don't hurt me...

                                     SHELLY
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

               Shelly turns his back on her. Charlene starts sobbing relief. 
               They're not going to hurt her. It's going to be all right. 
               Wrong. Shelly throws the bat to Lou. The heavy steps up to 
               the plate (as we RACK FOCUS to Shelly walking away) -- 
               CRUNCH!!! followed by the girl's SHRIEKS. Natalie buries her 
               head in Bernie's shoulder.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Tony and Lou)
                         Get 'em outta here. You ever see 
                         them in this joint again, kill 'em.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to Bernie and Natalie)
                         You two, you're still on shift.

               Shelly catches Larry's eye: I hope you were taking notes.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie's seated on the edge of his bed, drowning his sorrows 
               with a bottle of gin. Moonlight paints him in jail bars of 
               shadow. Natalie lingers in the b.g.

                                     BERNIE
                         I did this to myself. I planted the 
                         seed. When Angela took off with Mikey, 
                         I didn't... I never made an effort 
                         to get back in his life. I figured, 
                         the kid don't need a loser for a 
                         father. Now it's all come full circle. 
                         I give him the money, I open the 
                         door to all this... I musta had it 
                         coming. Payback.

               Natalie's hand lowers the needle onto the Sinatra record.

               "Nice 'n' Easy" starts up.

               She walks over to Bernie, takes the bottle away. Helps him 
               to his feet.

               He gives himself over to her reassuring embrace. Natalie 
               raises Bernie's face to her's.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, it's a big world out there. 
                         If you just took off -- if we took 
                         off.

               Bernie shakes his head. It's too late for that now.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

               Natalie staring up at the ceiling, Bernie nuzzled against 
               her. Her features appear softer than ever. Luminous in the 
               moonlight. Realization moist in her eyes.

                                     NATALIE
                         You awake, Bernie?

               He grunts something inaudible.

                                     NATALIE
                         I -- think I love you.

               Bernie tenses up. Huh?

                                     NATALIE
                         No, I don't think. I'm pretty certain 
                         of it.

               Bernie raises his head, not quite sure he heard her right.

               Natalie sits up, hugs her knees. Bernie finds himself staring 
               at her back.

                                     NATALIE
                         You blind-sided me, Bernie Lootz. I 
                         never saw this coming. You shouldn't 
                         do that to a girl.

               Bernie reaches out, caresses her back. She emits a shiver...

                                     NATALIE
                         There's still things you don't know... 
                         should know... I don't want to ruin 
                         it...

               Bernie pulls Natalie back toward him.

                                     BERNIE
                         It won't make any difference, Natalie. 
                         Whatever you come clean about, I'm 
                         not gonna feel any different about 
                         you. I'd say the words, but with my 
                         luck...

                                     NATALIE
                         Say 'em anyway. To hell with rotten 
                         luck. That's overs.

                                     BERNIE
                              (a beat)
                         I love you, Natalie.

               Natalie smothers her lips against Bernie's. He enshrouds her 
               in his arms. Fade out...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Fade into SOFT FOCUS. Slowing taking form... A CAT'S FACE 
               seen in extreme close-up.

               WIDER -- to reveal the cat resting on Bernie's chest. She 
               MEOWS as he stirs awake. He's stunned to see her there.

                                     BERNIE
                         Trixie?

               The cat jumps off his chest and slinks over to her empty 
               food bowl. Meows again. Bernie breaks into a wide smile.

                                     BERNIE
                         Trix. You came back.

               Bernie shields his eyes from the bright sunlight streaming 
               in through the blinds. Huh? This is a first for him. He's 
               never gotten direct sunlight in his room before. What's the 
               deal? Did the world just turn on its axis?

               He glances over his shoulder... No Natalie. Just her 
               impression in the sheets. And a note on her pillow. For a 
               moment his heart stops. He conjures up the worst. Grabs up 
               the note, unfolds it.

               We see a lipstick kiss and the words: HAVE A SPECTACULAR 
               DAY!

               Bernie lets out a joyful whoop! Leaps out of bed...

                                                              SMASH CUT TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

               CLOSE-UP: Trixie eating some tuna out of her bowl. We hear 
               the record player needle drop on "Luck Be A Lady." Cut to:

               Bernie's feet gliding around the room... PAN UP to Bernie 
               dancing with himself. He's positively aglow. He snatches up 
               a salt shaker and sings along with Sinatra. It's true -- 
               love makes the world go around. It obviously also gives life 
               to dead plants, as evidenced by the small bulb that has sprung 
               up overnight above his radiator. But we won't dwell on that.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - DAY

               Bernie struts into the casino a changed man (still to the 
               tune of "Luck Be a Lady"). Even his limp seems less pronounced 
               as he greets fellow workers as they pass.

               He catches a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror. Maybe for 
               the first time, he likes what he sees. In the reflection he 
               notices Natalie smiling at him. He meets her eyes. She averts 
               them quickly, keeps walking.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

               Shelly watches Bernie from the video monitor. He appears 
               less than delighted over Bernie's sunny disposition. He picks 
               up the phone, dials.

                                     SHELLY
                              (into phone)
                         Yeah, it's me. Get Bernie over to 
                         crap table six.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Per usual, Bernie walks up to the bar, asks for a cup of 
               coffee. Doris slides it over.

                                     BERNIE
                              (looking around)
                         Got any cre --

               Before he can answer, Doris hands him a container of cream.

               A full container. Taken aback, he starts pouring it into his 
               cup, when he hears a VOICE over the intercom:

                                     VOICE (V.O.)
                         Lovett, party of six, your table is 
                         ready, Lovett, party of six.

               Bernie looks to Doris.

                                     BERNIE
                         Duty calls.

               INT. CASINO - MONTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

               A -- Bernie arrives at a hundred dollar blackjack table just 
               in time for the dealer to bust out. The crowd goes crazy!

               B -- Bernie takes a break by leaning up against the side of 
               a slot machine. Suddenly, the woman playing it hits a jackpot.

               C -- Everywhere he seems to go, people continue to win.

               D -- Bernie, despite the spooky irony, can't help but smile 
               as mountains of chips pile up on the tables. Shelly appears 
               behind him. Not a happy camper. He gestures Bernie to follow 
               him.

               INT. CASINO SLOTS AREA - NIGHT

               They head over to a section of slots. As they pass one of 
               those huge million dollar slots, the FLOOR MANAGER cuts in 
               front of them.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Hey, Shelly, check it out. The new 
                         Mega-Million. I call her Marnie, 
                         'cause she's one frigid broad. Sure, 
                         once in a while she'll flash you a 
                         bit of tit, but your chances of 
                         hitting a home run -- one in twenty 
                         million. Here, give her a shot...

               He hands Shelly a cup of quarters, takes off. Shelly looks 
               to Bernie. He's trying to keep a lid on his anger.

                                     SHELLY
                              (feeding Marnie 
                              quarters)
                         You wanna tell me what's going on 
                         out there?

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't know...

               Shelly pulls the lever.

                                     SHELLY
                         What do you mean...

               Marnie immediately spits out a small jackpot.

                                     SHELLY
                              (reacts with surprise)
                         What do you mean, you don't know? 
                         We're down almost a mil out there. 
                         Doesn't seem strange to you?

                                     BERNIE
                              (shrugs)
                         Guess I'm having an off day.

                                     SHELLY
                         You don't have off days, Lootz. You're 
                         shitty luck incarnate. What's wrong? 
                         You coming down with something? You've 
                         got this look about you...

               Shelly starts feeding Marnie again.

                                     BERNIE
                         Nothing's wrong. Fact is, I've never 
                         felt better.

                                     SHELLY
                         What's that supposed to mean?

                                     BERNIE
                         She loves me, Shelly. She told me 
                         last night. Natalie.

               On the mention of Natalie's name, we hear a shrieking SIREN, 
               followed by a deafening toll of slot bells. Shelly's just 
               landed the million dollar jackpot. Shelly stares at the slot 
               in surprise -- then looks over at Bernie. Realization hits 
               hard. Fuck! The floor manager staggers over. His expression 
               is priceless.

                                     FLOOR MANAGER
                         Sweet Jesus... you popped her 
                         cherries.

               SEVERAL CASINO WORKERS have gathered to witness the 
               deflowering of Marnie. They gaze reverently upon her, as if 
               witnessing the "Close Encounters" mothership for the first 
               time. Shelly drags Bernie out of earshot.

                                     SHELLY
                         Natalie? She told you, she loves 
                         you?

               Bernie nods, a huge grin wrenching his cheeks apart. He's 
               about to go helium on us.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Natalie's serving drinks to a table of high rollers, when 
               Tony and Lou appear behind her...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               The door to Shelly's office slams behind Natalie. Shelly 
               glares at her from behind his desk. We see him thumbing his 
               steel abacus. The beads drifting toward the center. Natalie 
               shakily lights up a cigarette.

                                     SHELLY
                         Put that fucking thing out!

               Natalie, startled, drops her cigarettes. She kneels to gather 
               them up.

                                     NATALIE
                         Sorry.

                                     SHELLY
                         You should be. You've gone and fucked 
                         it up big time. I paid you to be his 
                         cooze companion, not his fucking 
                         true love. But, no, you had to go 
                         and get all profound on the poor 
                         schmuck.
                              (mimics female voice)
                         "I love you, Bernie." You know what 
                         you've gone and done, sweetheart? 
                         Those four little words of endearment 
                         have already cost this casino a 
                         million and counting today.

                                     NATALIE
                         I don't understand...

                                     SHELLY
                              (jumps to his feet)
                         Lady luck. You never heard'a lady 
                         luck?! That's what's goin' on out 
                         there. Lootz is Kryptonite on a stick. 
                         He should have 'em throwing ice cubes 
                         out there, but instead I got a fuckin' 
                         meltdown on my hands.

               Shelly walks around his desk to Natalie.

                                     SHELLY
                         OK, here's what's gonna happen. You're 
                         outta his life by the time he gets 
                         home. Don't even tell him to his 
                         face, just leave a note. I'll make 
                         some calls, situate you at another 
                         joint.

                                     NATALIE
                         I can't do that.

                                     SHELLY
                              (right in her face)
                         Excuse me?

                                     NATALIE
                         It wasn't an act. I meant it. I love 
                         him.

                                     SHELLY
                              (close to losing it)
                         What's there to fuckin' love? He's a 
                         loser. Always has been, always will 
                         be.

                                     NATALIE
                         I thought you were his friend...

                                     SHELLY
                         And I thought you were a smart cookie 
                         when I picked you out. You do not 
                         want to fuck me over, darlin'. I'll 
                         see to it that your next John's a 
                         rattlesnake out in the desert. Now 
                         get the fuck outta here.

               Natalie rushes from the office in tears. Shelly closes his 
               eyes for a moment -- gotta keep it together.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - NIGHT

               Bernie approaches some cocktail waitresses about to go off 
               duty.

                                     BERNIE
                         Hi. Any of you seen Natalie around? 
                         I'm supposed to give her a ride home.

                                     COCKTAIL WAITRESS #1
                         I think she left already. She wasn't 
                         feelin' too good. We been covering 
                         for her.

               Off Bernie's expression: Oh...

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - NIGHT

               Bernie's Buick pulls into the lot. He parks, heads for his 
               room.

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie enters. Flips on the light. No Natalie.

                                     BERNIE
                              (calls to the bathroom)
                         Natalie? You in there?

               No answer. He heads over. Finds it empty. Concern spreads 
               across his features. He glances around the room. Notices the 
               closet wide open. Natalie's clothes missing.

                                     BERNIE
                              (sotto)
                         Natalie.

               That's when he catches sight of the note taped to the dresser 
               mirror. He rushes over, rips it off.

               I'M SORRY BERNIE. I GUESS IT JUST WASN'T IN THE CARDS FOR 
               US. TAKE CARE, NATALIE.

               Bernie slumps to the floor in disbelief. Starts to tremble.

               Then rocks back and forth, wracked by stifled sobs. Christ, 
               make it stop hurting...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Bernie seated at the foot of the bed, drinking bourbon from 
               a solitary glass. He's almost gone through an entire bottle.

               He glances down, notices a pair of Natalie's stockings 
               sticking out from under the bed. He brings them up to his 
               face. Breathes her in, only to exhale a sorry breath.

               INT. SHANGRI-LA CASINO - BAR - NIGHT

               Bernie stops at the bar for a cup of coffee. Doris starts to 
               pour the cream... whoops... empty. Bernie shrugs. Par for 
               the course. Time to go to work.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               We see Bernie back in top form. Forget Mr. Cool, he's turned 
               into Mr. Freeze with a vengeance. The high rollers are facing 
               a nuclear winter on the floor thanks to Bernie.

               SERIES

               A -- A man with a fresh bankroll sits at a card table full 
               of hubris. Bernie pulls up a chair next to him.

               B -- We see a crowd of players hovering over a busy craps 
               table. The cheerful congregation turns sour as the dice are 
               flung. Players groan as they jettison the table, leaving 
               just Bernie...

               C -- We see a dealer pull a six card twenty one as players 
               sit with twelves and thirteens. They sit stunned as their 
               money is swept away. The same man with the hefty bankroll 
               unclips the last of his green. He throws it over to the dealer 
               to change in.

               D -- Larry, roaming the floor, is visibly disturbed by 
               Bernie's cooling ability. It's something he can't quantify 
               and it unsettles him. He glances up toward Shelly's 
               observation window, knows the man is gloating.

               Good call. From behind the glass, Shelly lights up a stogey. 
               Hint of a smile. You go, Bernie.

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               Johnny Cappella rocks the house. PAN ACROSS to Shelly and 
               Bernie seated in Shelly's booth. Shelly is in a jovial mood, 
               while Bernie is a portrait of misery.

                                     BERNIE
                         I want you to tell me the truth, 
                         Shelly. Did you say something to 
                         Natalie? Did you muscle her --

                                     SHELLY
                         Jesus, Bernie, is that what you think 
                         of me? That I would fuck with your 
                         happiness? That hurts.

               Bernie shrugs an apology, shifts his gaze to Johnny Cappella.

                                     BERNIE
                         This guy's all flash. No soul. I 
                         miss Buddy. Place isn't the same 
                         without him.

                                     SHELLY
                         Buddy was tired. I gave him an easy 
                         out. It coulda been a lot worse...

                                     BERNIE
                              (confused)
                         You gave him an easy out? What are 
                         you talkin' about? I thought he...

               Shelly looks almost... tortured. Something he needs to get 
               off his chest.

                                     SHELLY
                         He woulda never taken the buy-out 
                         offer. Buddy woulda stuck to his 
                         guns, no matter what. And they woulda 
                         ended up hurting him. I couldn't let 
                         that happen.

                                     BERNIE
                         Jesus... you... How can you sit here 
                         and justify it? Like you were Dr. 
                         Kevorkian or something?

                                     SHELLY
                         Listen to me, you dumb fuck -- I 
                         loved that sonofabitch. But his time 
                         was up. What I was supposed to do, 
                         leave him to those corporate wolves? 
                         What I did, it was the humanitarian 
                         thing. That I have no doubt about. 
                         Afterwards, I held him in my arms 
                         and I cried like a fucking baby. 
                         What? You got this look -- what's 
                         this fucking look?

               Off Bernie's shocked expression --

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Bernie sits watching TV, a bottle of Ten High next to him on 
               the bed. Same religious channel. This time it's a mass baptism 
               taking place on some river bank. He's about to doze off, 
               when he hears a light rapping on the door. He cocks his head, 
               not sure if it's the booze talking.

               Bernie throws open the door --

               Natalie standing there. A lonely angel framed in the doorway. 
               Suitcase at her feet. 24 carat tears glistening in the dark.

               They just stare at each other for an extended beat. Then 
               Natalie stumbles into Bernie's arms. Clingwraps herself to 
               him. Bernie squeezes his eyes closed. Holds on for dear life. 
               It's a different kind of pain now; one that hurts so good.

               ANGLE ON NATALIE

               from over Bernie's shoulder. There's a bittersweet look about 
               her. Nothing good can come of this. But that's tomorrow. A 
               long ways off.

               INT. BERNIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

               Bernie and Natalie lie in each other's arms. Bernie seems at 
               ease. Natalie eyeballs the ceiling, smoke wisping up from a 
               cigarette.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie? You awake?

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah.

                                     NATALIE
                         Let's just take off.

               Bernie looks over at her.

                                     NATALIE
                         I mean it. Let's just pack up and 
                         go. Tonight.

                                     BERNIE
                              (closes his eyes)
                         I can't do that. I've got an 
                         obligation to Shelly. There's no --

                                     NATALIE
                         Fuck Shelly. He doesn't give a shit 
                         about you. Let's just climb into 
                         your car and get the hell out of 
                         here.

               Bernie cuts her off.

                                     BERNIE
                         I can't do that, Natalie. They'd 
                         come after me. And because you were 
                         with me... I wouldn't want that on 
                         me.

               Natalie finishes her cigarette. Well, she's made her bed.

               Bernie starts nuzzling her. She turns away.

                                     NATALIE
                         Just hold me.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - DAY

               Shelly looking on as a high roller cleans up at craps. With 
               Bernie standing right there next to the guy.

               Which only seems to make it worse, as Bernie's presence spurs 
               the player on to an even bigger win.

               Bernie has that goofy "my heart is full" look about him.

               Which can mean only one thing in Shelly's book. The man looks 
               about ready to split an atom. We see Larry hovering nearby 
               with a smug grin. Off of Shelly's enraged expression...

               EXT. LUCKY STAR MOTEL - DAY

               Lou's black Oldsmobile pulls into the parking lot. Shelly 
               and the boys climb out, head for...

               EXT. THE MOTEL COURTYARD - DAY

               Natalie's sunning herself at the pool. The only other people 
               around are a middle-aged couple and a young boy.

               Shelly (slipping on his leather gloves), followed by Lou and 
               Tony, strides purposefully up to Natalie -- no hellos, nothing -- 
               just grabs her by the hair...

                                     NATALIE
                         Hey! Ouch! What are you...?

               He drags Natalie over to Bernie's room, kicks the door open, 
               shoves Natalie inside...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Shelly throws Natalie onto the bed. Lou closes the door and 
               draws the blinds.

                                     NATALIE
                         You got no fucking right...!

                                     SHELLY
                         What did I tell you?! What did I 
                         fuckin' tell you?!

                                     NATALIE
                         I tried... I couldn't...

                                     SHELLY
                         I don't give a fuck!

               Shelly heads over to the closet, rips it open, pulls out a 
               suitcase. He starts throwing Natalie's clothes into the case.

                                     SHELLY
                         You're gone, sweetheart. History. 
                         Kiss paradise goodbye.

                                     NATALIE
                              (hysterical)
                         I can't leave! I won't! I love him. 
                         Doesn't that mean anything to you, 
                         you heartless fuck?

               Shelly stops packing. He grabs Natalie up off the bed, starts 
               smacking her around.

                                     SHELLY
                         Who the fuck do you think you are? 
                         You ain't nobody! I could make you 
                         disappear like this...
                              (snaps his fingers)
                         And nobody would ever notice you 
                         were gone. Nobody!

                                     NATALIE
                              (yells)
                         Bernie would! I got friends! You 
                         don't fuckin' own me. You got no 
                         right --

               Shelly lifts Natalie up, throws her across the room into the 
               dresser mirror. SMASH! She crumbles to the floor, glass 
               showering her. Natalie grabs up a shard, rushes Shelly with 
               it...

                                     NATALIE
                         Fuck you!

               She slashes Shelly across the arm. Ouch, fuck! Before Tony 
               and Lou can make a move, Shelly ensnares her wrist -- snaps 
               it backwards -- AARRRRGGHHH!!! Shelly snatches up the shard, 
               shoves her back on the bed. We see her terror reflected in 
               the jagged glass against her cheek...

                                     SHELLY
                         You fuckin' cunt...

               He slices her cheek open.

               Tony and Lou look on with mutual expressions: Shelly's getting 
               a little carried away here.

               Shelly staggers to his feet...

                                     SHELLY
                         You think that's bad? That's just a 
                         taste, bitch. You're still here when 
                         Bernie gets home and I'll finish the 
                         job. I'll cut you into so many fuckin' 
                         pieces, the vultures'll be trading 
                         on you for a month.

               Shelly reaches into his jacket, pulls out a wad of bills.

               Throws them at Natalie.

                                     SHELLY
                         Here... go get yourself some cosmetic 
                         surgery.

               Shelly gestures to Tony and Lou. They exit the room, leaving 
               Natalie sobbing into one of Bernie's pillows.

               Bernie parks. Heads for his room. He's about to reach for 
               his key, when he realizes the door is slightly ajar. He pushes 
               his way into...

               INT. BERNIE'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               ...darkness.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie.

               Bernie fumbles for the light switch...

                                     NATALIE (O.S.)
                         No, don't. I've got a headache.

                                     BERNIE
                              (closing the door)
                         Did you take something? I got some 
                         aspirin in the --

                                     NATALIE
                         Yeah. I already took something.

               There's just enough moonlight in the room for Bernie to make 
               out Natalie curled over on the bed. As he approaches, he 
               trips over Natalie's suitcase on the floor.

                                     BERNIE
                         Ouch!

               He cuts himself on a splinter of shattered glass as he 
               staggers to his feet. Which draws his attention to the mirror. 
               Moonlight glows off the edges. That's all there is -- edges. 
               On the dresser: his bottle of Ten High. Empty.

               Confused, Bernie fumbles his way over to Natalie on the bed.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie, what happened? The mirror...

               He reaches out to touch her face... instead his hand makes 
               contact with a lump.

                                     BERNIE
                         Natalie.

               He jerks back, flips on the nightstand lamp.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, no! Shit...

               Bernie chokes at the sight of her. She clutches a bloody rag 
               to her cheek. Blood on the pillow... blood on the sheets...

               And tears.

                                     BERNIE
                         Oh Jesus... Natalie, who did this to 
                         you? We need to call the police...

                                     NATALIE
                         I love you, Bernie. I just want you 
                         to know that. I fell in love with 
                         you. That wasn't part of the plan. I 
                         thought... easy money...

                                     BERNIE
                         What are you saying?

                                     NATALIE
                         Shelly. He paid me to get next to 
                         you. To keep you around. Whatever it 
                         took...

                                     BERNIE
                              (a whisper)
                         Shelly?

                                     NATALIE
                         You got it right the first night. I 
                         was for sale. Bought and paid for. 
                         You were the easy mark, Bernie.

               Bernie slumps down on the edge of the bed. Sucker-punched.

               Trying to make sense of it.

                                     NATALIE
                         At first you were just another John. 
                         But then I started to take a closer 
                         look. For the first time, here was 
                         someone who wasn't trying to hustle 
                         me. Wasn't pretending to be somebody 
                         he wasn't. Just a decent guy trying 
                         to get back on track. And it didn't 
                         hurt any that you put me up on a 
                         pedestal. It sure puts the gutter 
                         into perspective...

                                     BERNIE
                              (still in disbelief)
                         Shelly...

                                     NATALIE
                         Shelly wants me gone. He says I bring 
                         you luck. Lady luck. I stayed... to 
                         tell you to your face... and then 
                         you wouldn't want me no more... and 
                         I could just go...

               Bernie stands shakily.

                                     BERNIE
                         We gotta get you to the hospital. 
                         We'll talk about this later.

                                     NATALIE
                         Just tell me one thing, Bernie. Tell 
                         me there's gonna be a later.

               Bernie doesn't answer her.

               INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM WAITING AREA - NIGHT

               FADE IN on Bernie's hunched over figure, waiting on Natalie.

               He tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions.

               Natalie's betrayal has finally sunken in. The man's in pain.

               His natural instinct is to just take off. Run. Fuck Natalie. 
               Fuck Shelly. Fuck this whole goddamn town.

               Suddenly he looks up. A couple of people pass by in front of 
               him... and then there she is. Standing a few feet away, face 
               patched-up, arms clutching herself, not sure whether to 
               approach him or not.

               The sight of her just breaks Bernie's heart. He stands slowly, 
               legs like jelly -- and in that instant it's all so clear to 
               him. He walks over, forgiveness in his eyes, contrition in 
               hers.

               She tries to say something. He shakes his head.

                                     BERNIE
                         Ssshh.

               They embrace with an intensity that threatens to merge their 
               atoms into a single being.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               Bernie drives down a quiet Vegas street. It's spooky.

               Almost too quiet. All the lights are green as they cruise 
               into the night.

                                     NATALIE
                         Tell me again, Bernie. Tell me it's 
                         all gonna be okay.

                                     BERNIE
                         Everything's gonna be fine. This is 
                         our time. This is you and me and 
                         we're going for it.

               Natalie leans over and kisses him. As she does so, she catches 
               sight of her face in the mirror. Starts to tear up.

                                     BERNIE
                         You look in the mirror, you don't 
                         like what you see, don't believe it. 
                         You look in my eyes. That's the only 
                         mirror you gonna need. Look in my 
                         eyes, Natalie.

               She looks into Bernie's eyes. Sees the most beautiful girl 
               in the world. Tears roll down her cheeks.

                                     BERNIE
                         I love you. Marry me?

               Off Natalie's startled reaction...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL - NIGHT

               A NEON SIGN READS: "HOLY ROLLER WEDDING CHAPEL. OPEN 24 
               HOURS."

               BOOM DOWN as Bernie carries Natalie out of the chapel, their 
               lips fused together.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie burn down the highway. The lights of the 
               big city just a glimmer in the rearview.

               Up ahead, a billboard reads: THE SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO. 
               TAKE A GAMBLE ON PARADISE.

               TIGHT on Bernie. His expression turns grim. Natalie picks up 
               on it. She shakes her head. Silently pleading: Bernie, no.

               Bernie tries to shrug it off. But the spectre of Shelly sits 
               firmly on his shoulder. There's no escaping him. We see Bernie 
               fighting it. Losing. SHIT!

               In the next instant, Bernie pulls a quick U-turn across the 
               middle shoulder, starts back toward Vegas.

               EXT. CASINO PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Bernie pulls into the parking lot. Kills his lights.

               INT. BERNIE'S BUICK - NIGHT

               Bernie reaches for the door. Natalie grabs his arm.

                                     NATALIE
                         You don't have to do this, Bernie.

                                     BERNIE
                         Yeah, I do. I have to tell him right 
                         to his face. I will not look over my 
                         shoulder for the rest of my life -- 
                         our lives.

                                     NATALIE
                         Bernie, your chart... that first 
                         night. I wasn't being straight with 
                         you. It's the worst chart I've ever 
                         seen. There's nothing in the cards 
                         for you. I'm scared...

                                     BERNIE
                         Don't you see, that was before you 
                         opened your heart to me. Everything's 
                         different now. I got lady luck on my 
                         side. Ain't nothing gonna happen to 
                         me.

               Natalie shakily opens her purse, pulls out a handful of 
               hundreds. Pushes the money at Bernie...

                                     NATALIE
                         It's three thousand dollars. Take 
                         it. Maybe Shelly'll accept it as a 
                         down payment. We can send him the 
                         rest in installments... after we get 
                         settled.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think --

                                     NATALIE
                         Take it.

               Bernie stuffs the cash in his jacket. Climbs out.

                                     BERNIE
                         Whatever happens, I --

                                     NATALIE
                              (abrupt)
                         I know, Bernie.

               She turns away. Stares out the window, tears streaming down 
               her cheeks.

                                     NATALIE
                              (sotto; gentle)
                         I know.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               Bernie makes for the Paradise Lounge. SPLIT SECOND FLASHBACK 
               as he imagines Shelly laying into Natalie. Fast cuts.

               Reverberating sound echoes. Just the fuel Bernie needs to 
               make his stand. By the time he arrives at

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               He's practically foaming at the mouth with rage. He barges 
               in to find Shelly at a table in agitated conversation with 
               Nicky, Larry and Marty. They fall silent, realizing something 
               is wrong.

                                     SHELLY
                         Bernie, what's the matter? You look 
                         a little fucking spooked.

               Bernie throws something in Shelly's face. It's that bloody 
               rag Natalie was holding to her cheek. It lands on the table 
               in front of everyone.

               Shelly swats it away with disgust. Jumps to his feet. WHAM!

               Bernie slugs him one. As Shelly doubles over, Bernie gets in 
               his face.

                                     BERNIE
                         You lay another finger on her, I 
                         swear to God I'll kill you. You hear 
                         me? I'll fuckin' kill you!

               Shelly's goons quickly move in, grab Bernie. Drag him away.

               Shelly composes himself, turns to his guests.

                                     SHELLY
                         Will you excuse me for a moment?

               He rushes off. Nicky shoots Larry a resigned look.

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Lou shoves Bernie inside. Bernie kisses floor. Shelly strides 
               past, leans against his desk. Bernie slowly drags himself to 
               his feet.

                                     BERNIE
                              (a hoarse whisper)
                         Why? Why, Shelly?

                                     SHELLY
                         Because you never give up a good 
                         thing, Bernie. You are a good thing. 
                         The best fuckin' cooler there ever 
                         was. And I need him back.

                                     BERNIE
                         He ain't never comin' back.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's a dead man talking.

                                     BERNIE
                         I'm through with this joint, Shelly. 
                         Natalie and me, we just got married. 
                         We're outta here. I'll get a job out 
                         there in the world. Send you half my 
                         paycheck every month. Make good on 
                         my obligations.

                                     SHELLY
                              (gets in Bernie's 
                              face)
                         You try to walk on me, Bernie, and 
                         I'll fuckin' bury you. The both of 
                         you.

                                     BERNIE
                         I don't think so.

               Shelly's expression: Oh yeah?

                                     BERNIE
                         You whack me, then Bernie Lootz ain't 
                         the world's biggest loser no more. 
                         That honor's gonna fall upon you, 
                         Shelly. And maybe you had it all 
                         along.

                                     SHELLY
                         What the fuck? Me? I'm the loser?

                                     BERNIE
                         What you got? What do you got in 
                         your life besides this joint?

                                     SHELLY
                         What the fuck more do I need?

                                     BERNIE
                         You got nothin', Shelly. This place -- 
                         your legacy -- it's a mirage. You 
                         turn your back and it don't even 
                         exist. There's no day, there's no 
                         night, it's all just one big fuckin' 
                         blur and it don't count for nothin'!

               Shelly looks to Tony and Lou:

                                     SHELLY
                         You believe this fuckin' guy?

               Bernie gets eye-to-eye with Shelly. A first.

                                     BERNIE
                         I feel real sorry for you. Yeah, you 
                         got this fear of germs thing. But it 
                         goes deeper than that. You can't get 
                         close to no one. On an emotional 
                         level. You're the worst kind of 
                         gambler there ever was: too scared 
                         to put his chips on the table. Too 
                         scared to open his heart... to extend 
                         any real kinda friendship. Always 
                         afraid it's gonna end out in the 
                         desert. Well, sweet fuckin' dreams, 
                         pal, 'cause I'm out and if that's 
                         where it ends, that's where it ends.

               Bernie turns his back on Shelly, strides over to the door.

                                     SHELLY
                         That's a real heartfelt speech, Lootz. 
                         All that Jimmy Stewart in ya face 
                         intensity. You almost sold me.
                              (massages his throat)
                         Man, I've got a fucking lump in my 
                         throat.
                              (a beat)
                         But it still don't change things. 
                         You bail on me without making good 
                         on my 150 G's and I'm gonna be forced 
                         to close the books on you. You and 
                         the broad. You leave me no choice.

               Bernie turns, looks at Shelly. Shelly's dead serious. They 
               hard stare each other for a beat. Bernie doesn't say anything. 
               At least, not out loud. His eyes do all the talking: "I guess 
               you leave me no choice either." HOLD on Bernie's steely 
               resolve.

               INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

               This could be the opening of the film -- Bernie standing 
               with his back to us, facing the gold elevator doors. Murky 
               reflection. The floor lights ascending fast...

               The doors open and the soundtrack goes SILENT. SLOW PUSH IN 
               on him as he takes in the action -- a gladiator about to 
               enter the Coliseum. Something comes alive in his eyes. A 
               spark of determination. This is not the expression of a loser. 
               CLOSE-UP as his foot steps onto the casino floor --

               An explosion of amplified CASINO WALLA shatters the previous 
               silence.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT

               We follow Bernie as he wanders through the casino like he's 
               done a thousand times -- but this time with conviction.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Bernie steps up to an empty table, throws down the whole 
               three grand onto the felt.

                                     BERNIE
                         Change only...

               The CREW working the table stop down as they realize who it 
               is. The table is dead. Bernie couldn't be needed. The croupier 
               slowly gathers up the green, hands it to the boxman.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Check change three thousand.

               The boxman counts the cash.

                                     BOXMAN
                         This a pleasure cruise, Bernie?

                                     BERNIE
                         You could say that.

                                     BOXMAN
                         Well, it'll be a short one. Table's 
                         dead.

                                     CROUPIER
                         It is now, anyway.

               The others chuckle. The boxman counts out the chips; they're 
               given to Bernie. He places them all on the passline.

               The stickman pushes over the dice. Bernie picks a couple.

               He throws....

                                     STICKMAN
                         Yo Eleven! Pay the line.

               Bernie picks up his three thousand dollars in winnings. He 
               lets it ride. The table quickly fills up with hungry players.

               Bernie throws the dice again...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Winner seven!

               Bernie is now paid six thousand dollars on his pass line 
               bet.

               The other players also collect their winnings. They can feel 
               something in the air.

               Bernie, forehead beaded with sweat, rubs the felt a little 
               before he picks up the dice. He throws...

                                     STICKMAN
                         Six easy. Easy way six!

               Bernie takes double odds on his bet. The boxman isn't sure 
               what to do. Does he stop him? Does he dare?

               In the b.g., people gather to watch the action. Whatever it 
               is, it's catching. The table next to them bursts into 
               applause.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR  MONTAGE - NIGHT

               A -- Close on a slot machine as it pays out. The woman grabs 
               the payout feverishly.

               B -- A group at the blackjack table cheers as the dealer 
               busts out.

               C -- The line at the cashier cage gets longer and longer. 

               -- CHIPS. Stacks and stacks of chips, being meticulously 
               counted.

               D -- A quick shot of a roulette ball dropping into number 
               twenty-one. The dealer slowly puts the marker atop a large 
               stack of chips in the twenty-one square.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               A shot of the faces of frenzied dice players waiting for the 
               outcome of the throw. Followed by a thunderous release as 
               the point is made.

               In the center of it all. Bernie Lootz. His rail is nearly 
               full of chips. The other players pat him on the back and 
               shake his hand as the croupiers busily pay the line.

               He's a winner. And it's infectious. He's gone and 
               "contaminated" the entire casino. The slots are ringing out 
               of control. CHEERING. WHOOPING. MOANS of delight. This much 
               excitement threatens to take the fucking roof off.

               Bernie just gazes around in amazement. If only Natalie could 
               see him now...

                                     BERNIE
                              (sotto)
                         Natalie... this is you...

               Bernie takes a thousand dollars in chips, tosses it gently 
               to the croupier.

                                     BERNIE
                         For the boys.

               The entire crew stop for a moment out of respect. Bernie 
               notices. They all nod as the boxman locks up the tip money.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Okay, we're coming out. Get your YO 
                         bets, C&E, any seven...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

               Shelly sits alone in his office, nursing a glass of Scotch, 
               listening to some scratchy Chet Baker on the turntable. He 
               looks pre-occupied. Almost melancholic. Bernie's assessment 
               of his life having hit home.

               Suddenly the door is thrown open. It's Tony...

                                     TONY
                         Shelly, take a look at number 4.

               INT. CASINO - CRAPS TABLES - MOMENTS LATER

               Shelly wanders up slowly to find Bernie at the center of the 
               crowd. He steps behind the table into the casino pit to get 
               a closer look.

                                     SHELLY
                              (to the boxman)
                         How much is he up?

               The boxman looks up nervously.

                                     BOXMAN
                         Around three hundred thousand.

               Shelly mouths the words under his breath.

                                     SHELLY
                         Why didn't one of you fucking geniuses 
                         call me?

                                     BOXMAN
                         We tried. You weren't picking up. 
                         Besides, it was Bernie.

               The game resumes.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Alright. We're coming out folks, 
                         hands high...

               Bernie stops.

                                     BERNIE
                         Wait!

               Everybody quiets down to listen.

                                     BERNIE
                         Color me up a hundred fifty thousand.
                              (beat)
                         And give it to him.

               Bernie points to Shelly standing in the pit. The crowd watches 
               the drama play out.

                                     BERNIE
                         That's what I owe you, Shelly. There 
                         it is. We're square.
                              (to the table)
                         Let it be known, Bernie Lootz lives 
                         up to his obligations.

               The boxman colors up a hundred fifty thousand in chips, lays 
               them out on the table. He counts it and claps his hands 
               together for the cameras.

                                     BOXMAN
                         One hundred fifty thousand, coming 
                         in.

               Shelly stands motionless. Staring into Bernie's eyes. The 
               whole crowd watches. After what seems like an eternity, Shelly 
               nods. Then the Boxman feeds the chips in with the others. A 
               moment later, we can nary tell they were ever gone.

               Larry appears next to Shelly. Nicky and Marty watching from 
               the sidelines -- dour expressions.

                                     LARRY
                         What's the matter with you? He's one 
                         of ours and he's taking us to the 
                         fucking cleaners.

                                     SHELLY
                         Lootz's off the clock. As long as 
                         he's off the clock, he's free to 
                         play. Just like every other schmuck 
                         in this joint.

                                     LARRY
                         It smells wrong. I'm shutting him 
                         down. He's not leaving here with a 
                         dime --

               Shelly suddenly jabs Larry in the throat with the tips of 
               his fingers. Larry gasps, starts to cave. Shelly keeps him 
               upright, escorts him to a nearby men's room. Nicky and Marty 
               looking on in amazement.

               INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

               The door flies open, Larry catapults into frame. OOF!

               Bounces off the wall. Shelly's right behind him. He drags 
               Larry to his feet. Slams him into the wall again -- gets 
               right up in his face.

                                     SHELLY
                         Now you listen real good, you Harvard 
                         turd. Lootz is on the up-and-up. He 
                         leaves here tonight with whatever he 
                         comes out with. You so much as touch 
                         a hair on his head and I'll fucking 
                         wallpaper this joint with your ass. 
                         Muted tones, right?
                              (slams him hard)
                         What's that? I don't hear nothing. 
                         Wait a minute -- yeah, now I hear 
                         it.

               Blended in at a subsonic level.

               Some kinda mantra: pain, pain, pain.

               Shelly headbutts Larry. It's like the sound of a walnut 
               cracking. Larry slumps to the floor. Shelly takes a deep 
               breath. Control, control, control. He heads over to the sink, 
               washes his hands -- over and over. Larry moaning in the b.g. 
               Shelly adjusts his tie in the mirror. Control.

               INT. CASINO FLOOR - CRAPS TABLES - NIGHT

               Shelly exits the men's room, makes his way back to the craps 
               table where Bernie is. Just in time to see Bernie lay twenty 
               five grand on the pass line. A waitress hands a drink off to 
               Bernie. He takes a healthy swig. Then picks up the dice.

               Throws.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Crap ace deuce! Line down!

               The crowd gasps in horror as Bernie's twenty five grand is 
               quickly raked in. He replaces it with another stack of chips.

               The dice are pushed over to him. He rubs the felt real gently 
               before throwing. Then lets loose the dice.

               All eyes follow the dice. They hit the felt and bounce around 
               behind a stack of chips. The stickman can't spot them.

                                     STICKMAN
                         Call it.

               A croupier makes the call as anxious players rubberneck to 
               get a look.

                                     CROUPIER
                         Twelve crap.

               The crowd groans again. It appears the streak is over.

               Bernie looks out over the felt. This is his moment of truth.

               He unloads his entire rail and puts it on the field.

               He yells out.

                                     BERNIE
                         Fifty thousand dollars!

               The crowd chimes in with every opinion under the sun.

                                     MAN (O.S.)
                         On the field? What're you fucking 
                         nuts?

                                     WOMAN (O.S.)
                         Don't do it!

                                     MAN 2 (O.S.)
                         Shake it, don't break it, baby!

               The dice are slowly pushed over to Bernie. The crowd is 
               feeling it. The entire casino is feeling it. Bernie lets out 
               a long soulful sigh. His whole life depends on the next throw 
               and everyone knows it.

               Bernie rubs the felt as usual and lines up the dice to show 
               a six and a six. He picks them up.

                                     BERNIE
                         Come on sixty-six!

               Locks eyes with Shelly -- then lets loose. The dice fly from 
               his hand. Slowly, ever so slowly we watch them sail across 
               the table. The entire table holds their breath in 
               anticipation...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SHANGRI-LA HOTEL AND CASINO - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

               Bernie throws open the doors, stumbles out. His limp seems 
               more pronounced. He wears a miserable expression.

               At the car Bernie steps up. Opens the door, slides in behind 
               the wheel.

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

               Natalie throws her arms around him...

                                     NATALIE
                         Thank God... I thought for sure...

               Bernie just looks at her. Pale, mournful features.

                                     NATALIE
                         It's okay, right? You guys worked it 
                         out. He took the three grand? Tell 
                         me it's okay, Bernie?

               He doesn't answer. Just starts up the car...

               INT. SHELLY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               On the surveillance monitors: the epidemic continues -- 
               players winning at every table. The Shangri-la's been wiped 
               out. There's no way they can cover this amount of winning 
               action.

               PANNING ACROSS to Shelly. Defeated. The phone rings 
               incessantly in the b.g. Shelly ignores it.

               Lou pokes his head into the office:

                                     LOU
                         Want me to get that, Shelly?

               Shelly doesn't respond. He reaches into his desk drawer for 
               that bottle and a glass. Is about to pour himself a shot...

               Fuck it. Pushes the glass aside. Takes it straight from the 
               bottle. The phone keeps ringing...

               On the scale model of the newly proposed Shangri-la. Hold on 
               it.

               WHAM! A chair enters frame, shatters "paradise."

               WIDER: Shelly trashing the model with a vengeance. Kicking 
               the debris around the office.

               Drenched in sweat, Shelly staggers over to his desk. Swats 
               the empty gin bottle to the floor. Picks up his disinfectant 
               spray, gives his desk one last wipedown. Immaculate.

               Stands, walks out...

               INT. BERNIE'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

               We see the lights of the city receding in Bernie's rearview 
               mirror. Once outside of the city limits Bernie pulls the car 
               over.

                                     NATALIE
                         What are you stopping for?

               Bernie throws open his door...

                                     BERNIE
                         I think I'm gonna...

               Throw up. And he does. It's as if he's choking up the entire 
               city. Everything that's bad about it. Finally, he pulls 
               himself back into the car. Slams the door.

               Natalie touches his cheek, a reassuring look in her eyes.

               Suddenly, he's smiling. He opens his coat and a huge wad of 
               cash tumbles out. He throws it up into the air. Natalie almost 
               chokes with surprise.

                                     BERNIE
                         Bahamas, here we come, baby.

               She throws her arms around him...

               Suddenly an EXPLOSION OF LIGHT! A flashlight. In the hand of 
               a MOTORCYCLE COP. He raps on the window...

                                     COP
                         Step out of the car please.

                                     BERNIE
                              (lowers the window)
                         What's the problem, officer?

               The cop runs the flashlight over the bundles of cash littering 
               the car interior.

                                     COP
                         Just step out of the car, please. 
                         Both of you.

               Bernie and Natalie exchange unsettled looks. The cop lowers 
               his hand to his gun. Bernie nods at Natalie. They climb out. 
               He directs them off to the side. Shines his light in their 
               faces.

                                     BERNIE
                         If my driving... if I was going a 
                         little fast -- I was just over 
                         excited, officer. See, we just
                         had a big win at the Shangri-la --

                                     COP
                         You didn't win nothing.

               The cop pulls out his revolver, trains it on them.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. SHANGRI-LA UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

               Shelly opens the door to his Cadillac. Climbs behind the 
               wheel. His keys are already waiting in the ignition. Who's 
               gonna steal Shelly Kaplow's car, right?

               Shelly doesn't start her up. He just leans back in his seat, 
               emits a deep sigh. He glances up at the rearview mirror.

               Catches sight of a SILHOUETTE in the back.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               Bernie and Natalie staring into the barrel of the cop's 
               revolver. Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Bernie nods. So 
               there you have it.

                                     NATALIE
                         Oh Jesus, Bernie, I knew it. It was 
                         too good to be true. Who were we 
                         kidding?

                                     COP
                         Get down on your knees. Both of you.

               They look at him in shock. He gestures them to the ground 
               behind Bernie's car. We CUT TO a shot from the highway: just 
               the cop standing at the tail-end of Bernie's car, Natalie 
               and Bernie hidden from view.

               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE

               down on their knees. Bernie places his arm around Natalie, 
               pulls her close to him. Paralyzed with terror, she still 
               manages a bittersweet smile.

               Bernie should be projecting fear, but there's nothing but 
               his overwhelming love for Natalie in his eyes. It's a two 
               way current.

               This is their last moment together; everything that needs to 
               be said is being transmitted through a look. A look that 
               says: no regrets.

               INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. SHELLY'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

               Nicky leans forward out of the shadows. Shelly holds his 
               gaze in the mirror. Nicky just shrugs.

                                     NICKY
                         The kid wants you should know, Shelly, 
                         he's just protecting our investment -- 
                         the old school way. See you around.

               Shelly nods. He knows the score... A flash of steel appears 
               against his head. Muzzle strobe -- THUP! So long, Shelly 
               Kaplow.

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY - NIGHT

               The cop looms over Bernie and Natalie. Cocks his pistol.

               Lowers the gun to the back of Bernie's head.

               They appear oblivious to it. They're already in another place. 
               Sunning themselves in the Bahamas.

               The cop squeezes back the trigger.

               ON BERNIE AND NATALIE

               still looking at each other. Suddenly the piercing shriek of

               SCREECHING TIRES... followed by a reverberating, bone 
               crunching --

               WHAM! -- and a GUNSHOT.

               Bernie and Natalie still staring into each other's eyes, not 
               quite sure what's just transpired. Only that they're still 
               breathing. They look around, startled to see the tail lights 
               of a PICK-UP TRUCK about ten yards away. The cop, their would-
               be assassin, rendered road kill beneath the wheels.

               All this in the blink of an eye.

               Natalie clutches Bernie's arm. Suppresses a hysterical, shock-
               induced giggle. Bernie just looks dumbfounded. He staggers 
               to his feet, rushes over to the pick-up truck. The driver's 
               head is protruding through the shattered windshield.

               Death-glazed eyes.

               Bernie feels for the man's pulse just to be sure. Shakes his 
               head. We see a dozen Coors empties on the seat and floor of 
               the truck.

               Natalie checks the cop. Likewise. Bernie comes over. They 
               regard each other breathlessly.

                                     BERNIE
                         He was drunk. It was just freak 
                         luck...
                              (catches himself...)

                                     NATALIE
                         Don't give it a name, Bernie. It 
                         scares me. All I know is, you're 
                         still running hot and that's a good 
                         thing. But we're only winners if we 
                         keep going. No looking back.

                                     BERNIE
                         Lady luck, Natalie. I'm calling it. 
                         Lady luck. And we got it as long as 
                         we're together. They can't touch us 
                         now.

               He kisses her furiously. Then drags her over to his car.

               They climb in. Drive off.

               EXT. VEGAS HIGHWAY/INT. BERNIE'S BUICK - DAWN

               Bernie's Buick racing into the sunrise. Racing toward the 
               dream. Bernie, eyes fixed on the road ahead, with the 
               contented smile of a man who has gambled on love -- and won.

               His prize, resting her head against his shoulder.

               The money, well, that ain't half bad as well. A smoky, trumpet 
               driven Chet Baker-like piece accentuates the triumphant mood 
               on the soundtrack, as we SUPERIMPOSE...

               INT. PARADISE LOUNGE - NIGHT

               ...a little flash-forward into the future. Larry sits with a 
               group of CORPORATE TYPES.

                         bright, gentlemen. Very, very bright.

               They raise their glasses to him. Congenial smiles, one and 
               all. Smiles that don't transcend to their eyes. Promises, 
               promises. We'll see... DISSOLVING BACK INTO...

FADE IN:

EXT. STREETS (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

End of the day.     An armored truck moves through the city of
Los Angeles.

EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
The armored truck pulls up. An ARMORED TRUCK GUARD emerges
from the back with a satchel and heads inside.


INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A large foyer. Security station and elevators. PARTY SOUNDS
can be heard from a second floor balcony.
DOUGLAS is the security guard manning the station. Seeing
the Armored car Guard entering, he picks up the phone and
dials. Beat. Into phone --
                         DOUGLAS
           Last delivery's finally here.
The Armored Truck Guard approaches the security station. As
he and Douglas exchange paperwork, the Armored Truck Guard
references the sounds from upstairs --
                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Party?
                         DOUGLAS
           Introducing a new line of jewelry.
                         ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Wife wants me to buy her a ruby ring.
           Told her to spend a little time with
           the family jewels first.
PING. An ELEVATOR opens. A second security guard's inside.
Handing over the satchel and heading out --
                           ARMORED TRUCK GUARD
           Keep it real.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
We see the security guard with the satchel use a key-card to
gain elevator access to the lower floors. As the elevator
doors slide closed...

                                                              3.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER
An exclusive showroom. Display tables empty. At one end of
the room, the elevator. At the other end, the open door to
a walk-in vault.

The ELEVATOR PINGS, and the doors open. The guard emerges
with the cart. Pushes it across the room to the outside of
the vault.
A man in a suit emerges from the vault and starts unloading
the cart into the vault.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - DAY

A train arrives.   People jostle on and off.
One man remains on the platform. MILES. Crisp dresser.
Carrying a large leather bag. A cylinder hanging by a strap
over his shoulder.
The train doors begin to close.   When...
A fist inserts itself between the doors. They re-open, and
a man steps onto the platform. TONY FAIT. Well-dressed.
Intense.
Fait joins Miles. They watch the train pull out. They
check to make sure the station's empty. Then jump off the
platform into the tunnel and disappear.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The man in the suit has finished unloading the cart. He
closes the heavy vault door and spins a large wheel on the
door, securing the vault.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Fait and Miles run down the dark tunnel, staying close to
the wall. Miles stumbles. Falls toward the deadly, high-
voltage third rail.
Out of nowhere, Fait's hand grabs Miles' jacket. Stops him.
Just before he hits. Inches from the rail. Fait pulls him
back up and away from the danger.
                        FAIT
          Watch yourself.
Miles nods.

                                                              4.
                           FAIT
          Keep it tight.
Miles nods again, and they set off.


INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
Sounds of the PARTY continue from upstairs. At the security
station, the guard, Douglas, looks up from a magazine and
scans the security monitors.

ANGLE - SECURITY MONITORS
depicting the empty vault, empty vault anteroom, various
empty store areas and the elevator, in which we see the man
in the suit riding up.

BACK TO SCENE
Douglas settles back in with his magazine.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Fait and Miles reach an access door tagged with paint.    Fait
starts to open it.
Suddenly, the tunnel is filled with the ROAR of an
APPROACHING TRAIN. Fait and Miles leap to the wall.   Press
their backs against it as tightly as they can.
The TRAIN whooms past, inches from their faces. When it's
gone, Miles sighs with relief. Fait cracks the access door.

INT. SUBWAY UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
Fait moves quickly, Miles following. Fait makes fast lefts
and rights, following more spray paint.
They branch off into a small dirt-floored space, deep in the
sub-foundation of a building. Fait stops. Overhead is a
flat ceiling. On the ceiling, his flashlight finds a spray-
painted circle.
                           FAIT
          Bull's-eye.
Without a word, Miles begins assembling equipment.    Fait
pulls out a cell phone.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - (SANTA MONICA) ROOFTOP - DAY

                                                                    5.

A man, DUNCAN SU, sits in a rental 2002 Thunderbird.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Su's focused, intense, listening to a fancy WALKMAN through
HEADPHONES. We hear what he hears. Only there's no music,
just STATIC.
Suddenly, on Su's headphones, a PHONE RINGS. Su grows even
more alert. We hear a man with a French accent answer the
phone.
                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
           Yes?

                         FAIT (V.O.)
           We're in position.
                         CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
           Delivery confirmed. The stones are
           there.
                           FAIT (V.O.)
           Not for long.
CLICK.   HISS.
Su didn't like what he just heard.       Curses in Chinese.   And
takes off.

EXT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
Perched on the side of a cliff above the Pacific, next to
the park. The top floor is at street level.
Su easily gains access to the roof of the building. He
moves to an exact position just at the ocean-side edge. It's
an eight-story drop.
Su faces in.      And then... Hops backward off the roof.
Falling feet-first through the air, Su momentarily grabs
onto an eight-floor balcony rail, slowing his descent, then
lets go.
Momentarily grabs a seventh-floor rail and lets go. Grabs a
sixth-floor rail. Hangs on this time. Vaults lightly onto
the balcony.


INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

                                                                    6.
A large, free-standing FISH TANK BUBBLES away. Nearby,
CHRISTOPHE is packing to leave town. When...
                         SU (0.S.)
           Where are the stones?

Christophe turns.       Sees Su standing behind him.
                         CHRISTOPHE
                   (French accent)
           Who the fuck are you?
Wham.   The Chinese boxing version of a bitch-slap.
                         SU
           Who's getting them for you?

                            CHRISTOPHE
           Fuck off.
Wham!   Wham!   Wham!     Wham!   Much more violent than a bitch-
slap.
                            CHRISTOPHE
           I'll tell you.
                            SU
           I know.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
A plasma torch burns through the metal-reinforced slab
overhead. Fait taps Miles, who turns off the torch.
Fait hammers at the last layer. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A hole appears under the private display table, where it
can't be seen by the room's security camera.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait communicates via a high-tech, transmitting/receiving
earwig.
                            FAIT
           Daria.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY
Douglas looks up from his magazine and checks the security
monitors again. Everything a-okay.

                                                                   7.


ANGLE - FRONT DOOR
A limo pulls up outside.


EXT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - DAY
A uniformed chauffeur gets out of the limo, moves to the
back and opens the door. A very attractive woman in a
short, tight dress emerges.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - LOBBY - DAY

Escorted by the chauffeur, the woman, DARIA, enters. She
approaches the security station. Up close, in the light,
Daria's even more alluring. And knows how to wield it.
                        DARIA
          I'm here for the reception.
                          DOUGLAS
          Name, please?
                          DARIA
          Angie Rawlins.
Douglas scans a list of names.      Checks off hers.
                        DOUGLAS
          Thank you. You can go on up.       Front
          elevator, to the mezzanine.
Daria turns toward the elevator. Then doesn't go. Just
glances up toward the party, suddenly unenthusiastic.
                        DARIA
          ... I hate these things.      Don't you
          hate these things?
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm just here to do my job.
Daria looks back at Douglas.      Studies him a moment.   Liking
what she sees.
                        DARIA
          Then again, you never know who you're
          going to meet...
She shifts her wrap, baring cleavage.      Then leans over the
desk. Giving Douglas an eyeful.
                          DARIA

                                                               8.
          I'll bet you're a lot more fun than
          any of those boring people upstairs.
Douglas is unaffected.   Just looks at her blankly.
                         DOUGLAS
          Really, ma'am.   I have a job to do.
Daria doesn't understand why he's not interested in her.
Then she glimpses Douglas's magazine lying on the desk.

DARIA'S POV
The magazine is Genre.   Males for males.   Buff boys.   Big
pecs, big penises.


BACK TO SCENE
Daria steps back.
                        DARIA
          Well, I suppose I should go up and
          see what they're selling.
Daria turns back and calls to her chauffeur, TOMMY.
                         DARIA
          Tommy...
What happens next happens very quickly and sotto voce, as
Daria walks toward Tommy:
She whispers into a hidden mike --
                        DARIA
          Change of plans. He's gay.
Tommy hears it over his earwig.
                         TOMMY
          No way.
                         DARIA
          Yeah way.
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait and Miles have heard it, too.   Into his mike --
                          FAIT
          Tommy.    Your turn.

                                                            9.

A look of alarm on Tommy's face.    Into his mike --
                         TOMMY
          Uh-uh.

                        FAIT
          This isn't a conversation.    Do it.
It's an order.    Tommy knows he has to.   Shit.
                         TOMMY
          Shit.
                         DARIA
          Key-card.

Then, still to Tommy, her voice again at normal volume --
                        DARIA
          Why don't you keep my purse?     I
          shouldn't be too long.
Daria hands Tommy her purse. Palms the key-card from him.
Then heads toward the elevator, as...
Tommy replaces the sick look on his face. Does his best to
look flirty as he walks over to the security station. Leans
over the desk with a yummy-smile on his face.
                         TOMMY
          ... Aloha.
(NOTE: The following scene is INTERCUT with Scenes 20
 thru 28.)
Douglas looks up from his magazine.
                         DOUGLAS
          Hi.
                        TOMMY
          I hope you don't take offense at
          this... but I just have such a
          weakness for a man in uniform.
                        DOUGLAS
          If that's your thing...
                        TOMMY
          Uniform's definitely my thing. I
          mean, I see a sailor, I'm thinking,
          mmm, seafood. Y'know?
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm not actually supposed to be

                                                   10.
          talking on duty.
                        TOMMY
          Who's talking? Honey, this is a
          flirting... But you're probably just
          another good-looking man wasting it
          all on women. World's full of fools.
Beat.   Douglas lets him see the Genre magazine.
                        TOMMY
          Yahtzee!... Okay, Mr. I-Always-Have-
          A-Hard-Nightstick. Put away the
          pictures of those underfed, white
          males and let's broaden your
          horizons.

                        TOMMY (CONT'D)
          I like sunsets and puppy dogs, and
          I'm big in the pants. Just hope I'm
          not too cute for you. And don't tell
          me it's a color thing, hon, or I'll
          come over there and slap a little
          discrimination right upside your
          yummy little cheeks.
                        DOUGLAS
          I'm hooked up.
                        TOMMY
          Another big, hot, cuddly, black love-
          Jesus got there first. That bitch.
          Taking you. From me.
                        DOUGLAS
          Sorry.
                        TOMMY
          Hey... This day and age, sweetie, I
          can appreciate the monogamy. Saving
          it for your number one is keeping the
          world safe, and it's okay by me.
          Even if you are just breaking my
          heart... Guess I'll just have to come
          in here someday, let you catch me
          shoplifting and resist arrest -- just
          to have you wrestle me down and cuff
          me.
                        DOUGLAS
          I can be pretty rough.
                        TOMMY
          Don't you get me all excited now.   I
          was just learning to accept my
          disappointment.

                                                                11.

Tommy sticks out his hand.
                           TOMMY
          Tommy.     But you can call me Rachel.

Shaking hands --
                        DOUGLAS
          Douglas. And, man, I really gotta
          get back to what I'm supposed to be
          doing, okay?
He looks away.     Scans the monitors.


ANGLE - MONITORS
Everything looks normal.

ANGLE BACK ON TOMMY AND DOUGLAS
Seeing Douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault,
Tommy relaxes.
                        TOMMY
          I'll leave you alone. But is it okay
          if I just stand here and stare at the
          muscles I'll be missing for the rest
          of my
          life?
OFF which...

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Daria gets in. Looks back to make sure Tommy has Douglas's
attention. He does.
Instead of going up, Daria uses the key-card to access the
controls to go down.

ANOTHER ANGLE
As the doors close, Daria shoots a wink back at...

TOMMY
who furtively flips her the bird.        Never missing a beat with
Douglas.

                                                            12.
INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait emerges from the hole beneath the table.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY

On the monitors, we see Fait in the vault anteroom and Daria
descending in the elevator as Tommy keeps Douglas's
attention diverted.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait holds a small digital camera next to the room's
security camera. Mimicking the security camera's slow pan,
Fait films the room. When he's done....

CLOSEUP - FAIT'S DIGITAL CAMERA
We see the panning shot of the room on the monitor. Fait
pulls up an on-screen menu, clicks on "Repeat." Whereupon
the mini-movie begins playing in a continuous loop.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
As Fait mounts his camera in front of the security camera,
Daria steps off the elevator, putting her hair up, ready to
work.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
On the anteroom monitor, we see the monitor on Fait's camera
slide into position, making the room look empty, as Tommy
continues diverting Douglas's attention.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait and Daria push the display table aside as Miles shoves
equipment bags through the hole in the floor.
Fait opens the leather bag, revealing tools, a tripod, three
steel cables and a long, rectangular box. Miles grabs a
high-tech DRILL. Begins BORING a hole high up on the vault
door.
Fait hands Daria the tripod to set up, while he uncoils the
steel cables, attaches them to the wheel on the vault door.
Then opens the rectangular box and lifts out what's inside.
A surface-to-air missile. Fait sets it on the tripod.

                                                             13.
Miles, the hole drilled, picks up the cylinder he'd had
slung over his shoulder. Pulls out a pressurized metal
canister of liquid nitrogen.
Miles injects the nitrogen into the hole. A CRACKLING sound
as the super-low-temp LIQUID spreads out inside the vault
door. The outside frosts over.
Fait finishes attaching the free ends of the cables to clips
on the SAM. Final checks of the rig.
                        FAIT
          Out.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

Speeding through L.A.   Calling 911 on a cell phone.
                        SU
          ... I want to report a crime in
          progress.

INT. SUB-FOUNDATION - DAY
Fait is the last one down through the hole.   Beat.    He looks
at the others.
                        FAIT
          Faith.
                        MILES
          Faith.
                        DARIA
          Faith.
Fait pulls out a remote control firing device.   He pushes
the button. And...

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The SAM IGNITES with a blinding flash and streaks across the
room. The steel cables instantly snap taut and... RIP the
vault's wheel and frozen locking mechanism right the fuck
out of the door.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
They felt a rumble.   Tommy covers --
                        TOMMY
          Earthquake.

                                                             14.

Douglas checks the monitors.      Everything looks okay.
                        TOMMY
          Bet you know how to hit a ten on the
          Richter scale...


INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
The crew re-emerges through the floor to find the vault door
in pieces and a hole the size of a Sub Zero where the SAM
augured into the opposite wall.
                          DARIA
          Holy shit...

Fait's already swinging open the vault.
                        FAIT
          This will trigger the silent alarm.
          Let's go. We got eleven minutes.
Miles moves down the rows of   drawers, using a tool to pop
all the locks. Fait and Daria   follow behind, quickly pulling
out the drawers and emptying   jewels into nylon bags. Fait
empties drawer after drawer.    All white diamonds. When...
He opens a drawer containing various colored diamonds.     And
stops, admiring them.
                        FAIT
          ... I love colored stones... Look at
          this...
He holds up a small, faceted blue diamond.
                        FAIT
          Two-point-seven million.
Into the bag.
                        MILES
          Whose shit we stealing, anyway?
                        FAIT
          Drug dealers and money launderers.
                          DARIA
          Works for me.
Then something else catches his eye. He holds up a small,
pink diamond on a chain. Admires it.
                        FAIT
          This I can use.

                                                           15.

And pockets it.
                         DARIA
          T.

Fait moves to her. Daria's fishing into a nylon bag she
found in a drawer. Pulls out a handful of... Large black
diamonds. Many more in the bag.
                         FAIT
          Pow.
He takes the bag. Stows it in his jacket. When...
Suddenly, Fait's CELL PHONE RINGS. Surprising them.   Beat.
Fait answers.

                         FAIT
          Go.
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY
Su's speeding through Los Angeles streets.
                        SU
          Your employer betrayed you. The
          police are on the way. Leave the
          black stones.
                         FAIT
          Who is this?
                        SU
          You know the ones I mean.
                        FAIT
          Don't think I'll do that.
Fait just hangs up.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
Tommy and Douglas hear APPROACHING SIRENS. The SIRENS STOP
outside. SWAT, cops, the works. All heading for the front
door. Tommy whispers urgently into his mike.
                        TOMMY
          Shit.  Five-0 at the do'.
                  (then, aloud to
                  Douglas)
          Better move my car.

                                                          16.

INT. VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Fait grabs a bag of jewels.
                           FAIT
          Go time.     Leave the rest.

INT. LOBBY - SECURITY STATION - DAY
SWAT swarms in.
Tommy exits behind them.


INT./EXT. LIMO - DAY
Tommy gets in.    A SWAT COP signals him.
                           SWAT COP
          Move it out.

INT. UTILITY TUNNELS - DAY
Fait, Miles, and Daria run.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAY
Slam! Fait, Miles, and Daria blast out the access door.
Fait kneels, feels the track.
                         FAIT
          Stopped the trains.
                  (then)
          We're in the rabbit hole, they're
          sending down the snakes.
                  (then)
          Daria comes with me.
                  (to Miles)
          I got no idea where you should go,
          but you know where to end up.
Miles nods.
                           FAIT
          Faith.
                           MILES
          Faith.

INT. SU'S RENTAL T-BIRD - DAY

                                                                17.
Su studies a computer map of downtown as he drives.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
running like hell. Rounds a curve.      Ahead are the rear
lights of a stopped train.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - FAIT AND DARIA - DAY
Approaching the front of another train, stopped at a
station. Fait signals Daria to stay put. Then pokes his
head around the corner of the train.


FAIT'S POV - STATION PLATFORM
SWAT cops hustle passengers off the train. One SWAT GUY
helps another up to check the top of the train. The SECOND
COP jumps back down.
                          SWAT COP #2
             All clear.

ANGLE BACK
Fait turns back to Daria. Signals her to climb up onto the
top of the train. Then begins climbing after her.
As Fait reaches the driver's window, he sees ANOTHER SWAT
COP approaching the train's DRIVER, checking under seats,
etc.
Fait has to climb fast. The SWAT Guy and the Driver getting
closer. Looking up. Just as...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - THEIR POV - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's leg just clears the window.      They don't see it.
But...

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
As Fait rolls onto the top of the train...

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The NOISE causes the SWAT Cop to react.      To the Driver --
                          SWAT COP #3
             Hold it.

                                                              18.

A moment, as they stop and the Cop looks around.    The Cop
checks the Driver's compartment. Nothing.
                         SWAT COP #3
                  (radios)
          Train's clear.
The Cop exits.    The Driver enters his compartment.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
ANOTHER SWAT COP stands outside the Driver's window.
                         DRIVER
          Okay to go?
                        SWAT COP #4
          Just hang tight.
During which, just above them...
Fait and Daria lie very still. Daria's tense. Fait winks at
her, trying to relax her. Daria's still tense. He raises his
eyebrows slightly. Shifts his gaze down.
She doesn't get it. Finally follows his gaze. Sees her
position is giving him a full view of her cleavage. She
looks back at him in disbelief.
                         FAIT
          Nice.
That does it. She relaxes and smiles back. Under which a
voice crackles over the SWAT Cop's radio.
                         RADIO (V.O.)
          All clear.
                          SWAT COP #4
                    (to Driver)
          Okay.    Get this train outta here.
Whereupon the train jerks to a start.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MILES - DAY
running toward the rear of the stopped train.   Leaping onto
the rear steps. When...
Out of nowhere, a foot catches him in the head, sending him
flying back down onto the rails. And... There is Su in
front of him.

                                                             19.
                        SU
          The stones.

                        MILES
          You'll have to come and get 'em.

Su moves on Miles. Miles throws a solid punch at him. Su
and Miles fight on the track behind the stopped train. The
deadly third rail making the fight even more dangerous.
Miles is a street boxer. He's good. He's ferocious. But
he's no match for Su. When Miles is subdued, Su grabs the
bag of jewels, makes sure Miles doesn't have any more, then
goes.


INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
Rocketing underground. The tunnel ceiling whizzes by above
Fait and Daria. Intermittent tunnel fixtures just inches
from their heads.
Every time the train takes a curve, they both slide toward
the edge. Fait places a calming hand on top of Daria's. The
car takes a wide curve.
Daria's body flips to the side. She loses her grip.
Screams as she starts to fall off the train. Fait reaches
for Daria, losing his grip on his bag, which plummets off
the train.
Fait can't grab her. The train jerks again. He starts
sliding away from her, off the opposite side. Fait thrusts
out both hands as far as he can. And...
Just snags her at the last second. Grips Daria's wrists
with all he's got. They're now draped across the curved roof
of the train. Hands in the middle. If Daria slips, or Fait
lets her go, they both die.

INT. RENTAL T-BIRD (OUTSIDE SUBWAY ENTRANCE) - DAY
Su gets in. Empties Miles' nylon bag into his lap. A
fortune in gems and jewelry pours out. Su sifts through it,
increasingly agitated. What he wants isn't there. He throws
the bag down, cursing in Chinese.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - SUBWAY CAR ROOF - DAY
Fait is at his limit. His grip starts to loosen. When the
train begins to slow. They pull into a station and stop.
Fait releases Daria, and she drops to the platform.

                                                            20.
Fait jumps down on the other side. He's lost the bag of
jewels. Knows they're gone for good. He feels for the bag
of black diamonds. Still has them.
Unseen, Fait joins Daria on the platform, and, hand in hand,
they melt into the crowd of commuters.


EXT. AIRPORT - GENERAL AVIATION TERMINAL - DUSK
A stretch limo and a Cadillac Escalade wait on the tarmac
next to a Gulfstream, which has just arrived.
The jet door opens, and a man emerges with a bodyguard. The
man, LING, is Asian, about forty. Emanates grace and power.
As Ling descends the steps, and two thugs from the SUV go to
retrieve baggage...
A woman steps out of the waiting limo to greet Ling.   She's
also Asian. Dressed in American casual. Beautiful.     SONA.
She's not smiling. As Ling approaches her --
                        LING
          Enjoying California?
CHARLES, the bodyguard, answers for himself.
                        CHARLES
          Hope we're not here long.    I hate
          sunshine.
Ling kisses Sona on the lips.    Then --
                        SONA
          We may have a problem.
Ling's mood quickly darkens.
                        LING
          The stones?
                        SONA
          The exchange was just robbed.
                        LING
          ... Let's hope that was part of the
          plan.

INT. JEWELRY EXCHANGE - VAULT ANTEROOM - DAY
Swarming with police. When... Su steps off the elevator.
He's carrying the bag of jewels he took from Miles. To a
COP --
                        SU

                                                            21.
          Who's in charge?
                        COP
          Who wants to know?
Su flashes I.D. We don't see it.   The Cop scopes it a
moment. He's clearly impressed.
                        COP
          Follow me.
As he leads Su toward his superiors in the vault...

INT. VANESSA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

VANESSA, eight, is in her pajamas, playing SIM Coaster on
her computer. The door opens. Fait enters. His daughter.
                        FAIT
          You know it's past your bedtime.
                        VANESSA
          Just a little longer.
                        FAIT
                  (imitating sweetly)
          'Just a little longer'... School
          tomorrow, baby. Let's go.
Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the
computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she
doesn't dawdle.
                       FAIT
          'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.'
          'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy-
          time.
Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once
around the room and tucks her into bed.
                        FAIT
          You bag some Z's now, you hear?
                        VANESSA
          Okay.
                        FAIT
          ... Wait a second.
                        VANESSA
          What?
                        FAIT
          I think there's something behind your

                                                               22.
          ear.
                        VANESSA
          Oh, please, that is so lame.     It's in
          your hand.

She takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over.
Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over.
More nothing. She's stumped.
Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them,
there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain.
                        VANESSA
          How'd you do that?

Fait slips the chain over her head and kisses her.
                          FAIT
          Good night.
Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her.
                        FAIT
          Angels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,
          watch her, while she rests.
A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa
holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available
light and shines in the dark.
Then she rolls over and closes her eyes.

INT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
Fait enters.     Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.    To Tonita
--
                        FAIT
          She'll stay down now.
                        TONITA
          She won't listen to me lately.     Only
          you.
                        FAIT
          I'll have a talk with her about it
          tomorrow.
Still to the nanny --
                        FAIT
          I got some work to do in the office.
          You can go on to bed.

                                                            23.
                        TONITA
          I'm watching TV, if you need me.
Fait exits.


INT. FAIT'S BAR/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait enters.    Tommy and Daria are there.

                        TOMMY
          What the hell happened?
Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room
to another door.


INT. FAIT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
They enter.    Fait shuts the door.
                        TOMMY
          Should we be considering a
          long vacation in a warm,
          foreign climate where there's
          no extradition?
Fait's thinking it through.
                        FAIT
          The guy who called was only
          interested in the black stones...
                        DARIA
          Christophe sold us out.
                          FAIT
          Or something.
Just then, Miles enters.
                          DARIA
          You made it.
                        MILES
          By the skin of my ass. Some
          Chinese dude kicked me around
          the motherfuckin' block. Busted
          my ear piece.
He takes the broken communication device out of his ear and
tosses it on the table.
                        MILES
          Snagged my loot, too... Maybe time to

                                                              24.
          rethink the no-gun policy.
                        TOMMY
          Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least
          you didn't have to play all foxy with
          the rent-a-cop.

Fait pulls out the bag of black diamonds.
                        FAIT
          Means this is all we got.
                        DARIA
          So what do we do?
                        FAIT
          You all wait to hear from me.
                        TOMMY
          Where're you going?
                        FAIT
          To get some answers.
Miles moves to go with him.
                        MILES
          I got your back.
                        FAIT
          No. I got us into this.     I'll call
          you if I need you.
Daria moves to him.   Their eyes meet.
                         DARIA
          Be careful.
Fait gives her a kiss.   Then goes.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Christophe's arms are   wrapped around the large fish tank,
one arm over the top,   the other through the legs of the
stand. His hands are    bound. He can't move. His beaten
face is pressed to the   glass. Large, weird fish swim past
in front of him.
The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side
of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe.
Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with
him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs
stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow
them.

                                                            25.

                        LING
          So this is Mr. Christophe?
                        SONA
          Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish
          tank are a new look.
                        LING
          Apparently we're not his first
          visitors today.
                        CHRISTOPHE
          Please, Monsieur Ling --
Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder.

                        LING
          Whatever you're going to say... Make
          it the truth.

EXT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - M1A1 TANK - NIGHT
Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot
goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is
spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing
seemingly at random. When...
The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in
front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice.
                        VOICE (O.S.)
          Bang.
A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man,
pops his head up out of the tank.
                        ARCHIE
          Like it?
                        FAIT
          It's cool.
As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait --
                        ARCHIE
          Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo
          included... Reactive armor, twin M240
          machine guns, 120mm smoothbore
          cannon. Guaranteed to get you
          through the rougher areas of the city
          and keep the neighbors in line.
                        FAIT
          Pass.

                                                         26.

                        ARCHIE
          How about a Marine Corps assault
          hovercraft?
                        FAIT
          I got other business.
Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN
UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie.
                        MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS
          We're outta room over here, Arch.
                        ARCHIE
          Stack 'em in the office, if you have
          to.
Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait.
                        ARCHIE
          ... You weren't downtown tonight by
          any chance, were you, Tony?
                        FAIT
          Don't know what you're talking about.
                        ARCHIE
          Me either.
                        FAIT
          Ever see black diamonds before?
                        ARCHIE
          White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil
          Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips.
          Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No.
Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black
diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup.
Studies them a moment. Shrugs.
                        ARCHIE
          You got me.
                        FAIT
          Find out how much they're worth.
                        ARCHIE
          There a timetable on this, or --
                        FAIT
          Yesterday.
                        ARCHIE
          That's what I figured.

                                                                27.

Fait's heading out.
                        FAIT
          I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a
          guy who fucked me over.


INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT
Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick.

INT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed
door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly
out into the room. Looking for Christophe.
Fait continues moving around through the room. When he
steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out.
Water. The carpet's soaked.
His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a
switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on.
REVEAL Christophe.     Stuffed inside the tank.     Sleeping with
the fishes.
                        SU (O.S.)
          Looks dead to me.
Behind him.   Fait turns around.      Sees Su.   Sitting on a
sofa.
                        FAIT
          Guess you got to him first.
                           SU
          Not me.     Someone else.
Fait does the math.
                        FAIT
          ... You're the one who called me.
          The one who took on my guy... Who the
          fuck are you, man?
                          SU
          My name is Su.
                           FAIT
          Cool.     I'm Sally.
                        SU
          I want the black stones.

                                                                  28.

                            FAIT
             Yeah?   Make me an offer.
Su stands.

                           SU
             You can walk out of here.
                            FAIT
             ... No deal.
Fait launches   himself at Su. Gonna fight     his way    out the
door. A much    better fighter than Miles.     And...    He's saved
by the bell:    the PHONE RINGS. The fight     stops.     The
phone's near   Fait. Beat. The answering      machine    picks up.

                           CHRISTOPHE (V.O.)
             Christophe here. Leave a message.
BEEP.
                           LING (V.O.)
             I know you're there, Mr. Fait.
Beat.   Fait pushes the button for the speakerphone.
                            FAIT
             Who's this?
INTERCUT WITH:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
Overlooking L.A. Ling and Sona. Enjoying hotel room
service. Ling's on a cell phone.
                             LING
             The man for   whom Mr. Christophe
             arranged to   have the black stones
             brought into   the country and
             deposited at   the jewelry exchange.
             The man who   wants them back. Now.

             Fine.   How much?
                           LING
             Maybe you didn't understand me.    The
             stones are already mine.
                           FAIT
             I got 'em, I'm selling 'em. So get
             your bid in or go fuck yourself.

                           LING
             I don't have time for this.
                           FAIT
             That your final offer?

                           LING
             I can be a very dangerous man, Mr.
             Fait.
Fait just hangs up.
                        FAIT
          Everybody think I'm the fucking
          Goodwill or something...? Look, I've
          had a shitty night, and so far, I got
          zip for all my troubles. So I don't
          know who the fuck you are, and I
          don't care. But hear this: you can
          beat my ass around the block all
          night --
          Brother, it ain't gonna get you those
          stones.
A long beat. The two men facing off. Then...
As Su stands aside, giving Fait a clear path out...

EXT. STREET NEAR CHRISTOPHE'S - NIGHT
Fait slides into his Porsche and drives off.

INT./EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Fait's checking his rearview mirror. Sees a black Cadillac
Escalade pull away from the curb and follow.
Fait doesn't need it.
                           FAIT
             Oh, man...
He's about    to punch it. When... A cop car turns a corner
and falls    in beside him. Fait throttles back. Keeps
driving.     Until, finally... The cops turn off. And now...
Fait hits    it. Until...
Traffic ahead forces Fait to turn into an alley in a semi-
industrial area. Behind him, the Escalade tries to follow,
but is cut off by the on-coming cars.
We STAY WITH Fait. He GUNS down the alley. Reaches an
intersecting alley. Turns. GUNS it out of sight.

                                                               30.
INT./EXT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Finally forcing its way through on-coming traffic and
speeding down the alley after Fait. The ESCALADE reaches the
intersection. Turns. And... CRASHES into a DUMPSTER rolled
into its path. The dumpster forces the Escalade into a
wall.

EXT. ALLEY (SEMI-INDUSTRIAL AREA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Two men start to get out of the Escalade. We recognize
them: Ling's two thugs. We barely have time to realize
that Fait's escape has been blocked by construction
equipment down the alley. He's had no choice but to turn
and fight.

Which is what he does, rushing the passenger.
The battle's ferocious and fast. Ultimately, Fait's out-
muscled and out-gunned. He's forced back against the open
door of the Escalade, guns to his head.
                        LING THUG #1
          Give us the stones.
                        FAIT
          Man, how many times I gotta tell
          people: I'm a business man. Make me
          a motherfucking offer.
                        LING THUG #2
          Here's your offer.
He cocks his pistol.   Beat.
                        FAIT
          That shit ain't gonna do it, biggie.
          'Cause I ain't scared of guns, and I
          ain't got the stones.
                        LING THUG #1
          Then you're gonna tell us where they
          are.
Whereupon a...
BOTTLE
Spins through the air. The bottle knocks the gun from one
Killer's hand. The gun skids under a nearby chain-link
fence.
REVEAL
the person who threw the bar.   Su. The fight's on.   Two on

                                                            31.
two. Using all means available. During the battle, a killer
tries to reach the gun behind the chain-link fence. Almost
gets it. When...
Two vicious DOBERMANS, guard dogs for the junkyard behind
the fence, leap out of nowhere, SNARLING and SNAPPING and
smash into the fence. The killer jumps back, barely
escaping with his arm.
The fight continues.   Fait and Su wear them down.
Behind the fence, the Dobies want flesh. Every time someone
crashes into the fence, they're right there trying to get a
piece.
Also, every time someone crashes into the old fence, we see
a series of chain-link connections loosen and break. Until
it happens one too many times. The entire fence goes down.
The dogs are out. The nearest targets: Su and Fait.Su and
Fait must now focus their attention on fighting off and
evading the ferocious attack dogs.
Finally, Su kicks one dog flying. Whip-kicks the other off
Fait. The two men run for the Escalade. The dogs are up in a
flash. Su spots an abandoned car. A rear door is open.
                        SU
          Over here.
Fait follows, right on his heels.
The dogs close in.
Su reaches the car. Dives through the open door.
Somersaults over the rear seat. Kicks open the far door and
rolls out. Fait dives in right behind him. The Dobies leap
in after Fait.
Fait's airborne completely through the back seat and out the
other side of the car. Clears the door. And... Su slams
the door shut.
We watch a two-Doberman pile-up against the suddenly closed
door as Su leaps to the car's other side and shuts that
door, too. Trapping the SNARLING, foaming DOGS inside.
The bad guys are gone. And Fait's CELL PHONE is RINGING. As
Fait digs out the phone, to Su --
                        FAIT
          Man, what the hell's up with these
          fucking stones?
                  (into phone)
          Go.

          It's Archie.    Bad news.   We got a
          problem.

CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR
Surveillance camera footage of Archie's.

Five armed African-Americans, faces hidden under baseball
caps, enter Archie's place, put Archie up against a wall and
start to beat something out of him.
                        ARCHIE (O.S.)
          ... I did what you said, right? Put
          it out on the street, trying to get
          info on the stones. Next thing I
          know, the Jackson Five here show
          up... Now, there are three
          significant elements to notice here.
          One, I'm outnumbered. Two, they're
          heavily armed. Three, they're gonna
          beat me like a bongo drum...

INT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - OFFICE - NIGHT
Archie, Fait and Su are watching the monitor. On screen,
Archie surrenders immediately.

          sure -- and they coulda beat me into
          a coma or killed me or whatever --
          but then, see, I'm thinking: How
          would I be able to tell Tony what
          happened to the stones? Right? What
          good am I dead or on life-support.
          So I threw in the towel.
          Reluctantly, of course. For your
          sake.

Big question is, who's behind the

          ... Shit... We gotta go see
          Chambers...
                  (beat, then)
          Oh, god... Vanessa...

INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - NIGHT
Large, empty, brightly-lit.    The door opens, and the limo
pulls in.

INT./EXT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The limo stops inside the hangar.    To Charles, re:   Vanessa
--
                        LING
          Find a place to put her.
Then, as Charles forces Vanessa out --
                        VANESSA
          My daddy's gonna come and kick your
          butts.
Sona just reaches out and slaps her. It hurts and surprises
Vanessa. Tears come to her eyes. But she's Fait's
daughter: she won't let this bitch make her cry. Charles
takes Vanessa out. Ling's mind is still on the phone call.
                        LING
          Su says he has the stones... But why
          cut me off? Why not negotiate for
          the girl? It doesn't make sense.
                        SONA

                                                           38.
             The buyers fly in tomorrow.   Should
             we stop them?
                            LING
             We'll never regain their confidence.
                     (beat)
             We need information. Find the right
             people. Pay whatever it costs.
             Something's not right. Something's
             happening with the stones.
                           SONA
             What about the girl?

                           LING
             We'll need her... She stays alive.
             For now.

INT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
In motion.     Fait and Su.   Fait on the cell to Tommy.
                             FAIT
             I'm on the way to Chambers... Yeah, I
             know, but I got no other choice.
             Just get the word into his pipeline
             that I'm coming and want permission
             to visit... I'll get back to you...
             Faith...
                      (hangs up)
             Maybe Chambers'll have a heart and
             give the stones back.
                      (then)
             Yeah, right -- and maybe he'll join
             the Peace Corps.
Su looks over.     Beat.
                           SU
             I'm sorry about your daughter... How
             old is she?
                           FAIT
             This ain't the Biography Channel.
             Let's just get there.
A long beat.     L.A. moving by outside.
                            FAIT
             Eight.   She'll be nine in September.
Beat.
                           SU

                                                          39.
          Mine is fifteen... Boyfriends...
                          FAIT
          Never happen.    I'll just kill
          'em.

                        SU
          I wish it were that easy.
Another beat.   Then --
                        FAIT
          About time I got the 4-1-1.
                          SU
          4-1-1?

                        FAIT
          What's this all about?
                        SU
          The stones aren't what you think they
          are.
                          FAIT
          No shit.
                  (then)
          How about the guy who has Vanessa?
                        SU
          He's exactly what you think he is --
          a thief and a killer.
                          FAIT
          Great...

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
A battered Ford camper now sits in the middle of the hangar.
We see Vanessa inside the camper. She's screaming. Loudly.
Not scared. Pissed. As...
Ling Thug #2 covers the windows with black spray paint.

ANGLE - ACROSS HANGAR
Ling Thug #2 hands car keys to Charles.
                        CHARLES
          Where'd you get that piece of shit?
                        LING THUG #1
          Let's just say Grandma and Grandpa
          have a long walk back from the

                                                              40.
          campground.
                        CHARLES
          You're sure you cleaned it out?
                        LING THUG #1
          Everything except the denture cream
          and adult diapers.
Vanessa's still screaming.   It's getting on Charles' nerves.
                        CHARLES
          I'm sick of her already.
He marches toward the van.   Unlocks the rear door and slides
it open.


INT./EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa is standing inside, still yelling.
                         CHARLES
          Shut up!
                         VANESSA
          You shut up!
                         CHARLES
          Go to sleep!
Vanessa reaches over and flicks ON the camper's TV.   Turns
it UP LOUD. Giving him stink-eye defiance as...
Charles slams the door shut.   Locks it.   And...
Now that Vanessa's made her point, and Charles can't see her
anymore, her boldness begins to subside. She lies down on
the bed and curls up, alone and scared inside the dark
camper.
Vanessa holds up the pink diamond pendant and gazes at it.
A talisman. Connecting her to her father. Not making the
fear go away, but giving her strength.

CLOSEUP - FAIT
As he drives, just as if he can sense Vanessa's need for him
--
                        FAIT
          Angels east, angels west, north and
          south, do your best. Guard her,
          watch her, while she rests.

OFF which, as Su regards him...

INT. MEDIUM SECURITY PRISON - CELLBLOCK - DAY
A prison guard escorts Fait and Su past cells, each just as
dreary, spare and institutional as the next. That is, until
they reach the last cell.
The last cell is guarded by two convict sentries.    Hanging
blankets cloak the cell entirely from view.
Fait, Su and the prison guard stop outside the cell. One
sentry blocks the way in as the other parts the blankets
covering the open cell doorway, REVEALING...


INT./EXT. CHAMBER'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION
After a walk through Kansas, this is the land of Oz. The
last cell is as comfy, colorful and a well-appointed as
Joel's office.
JUMP CHAMBERS, a large, brutal-looking, inner-city crime
lord has clearly used money and influence to improve the
terms of his incarceration.
Chambers puffs a Cuban as a prison trustee, WILLY CHICKENS,
sets out breakfast before him: fresh-squeezed OJ; eggs
benedict; large, juicy sausages; fresh breads and pastries;
French-press coffee; LA TIMES, NY TIMES, WSJ, Maxim, Hustler
and the daily mail.
The guard leaves Fait and Su, turns to go.
                          CHAMBERS
             Metz.
The guard, METZ, stops and looks back.
                           CHAMBERS
             D.V.D.'s broke.
                           METZ
             Get you a new one straight away, Mr.
             Chambers.
Metz goes.
Beat.   Chambers eyes Fait and Su through his cigar smoke.
                            CHAMBERS
             Thanks for your patience.   Man needs
             his nightly rest.
                     (then)
             Who's the gook?

                                                            42.

                        FAIT
          ... Chinese guy.
                        CHAMBERS
          ... No shoes in my crib.

Then, when Fait and Su have removed their shoes --
                         CHAMBERS
          In.
The sentries move aside. Fait and Su enter. Chambers ash-
trays his Cuban and digs into b-fast.
                        FAIT
          How you doing, Jump?
                        CHAMBERS
          Don't waste my precious time.
                        FAIT
          ... I got a problem.
                         CHAMBERS
          How's Daria?
                         FAIT
          ... Good.
                        CHAMBERS
          Always was good. From the moment I
          found her till the moment you took
          her away from me. Problem, you say?
                        FAIT
          ... The black stones.
                        CHAMBERS
          Bitch brought it in. Made me a lotta
          money. But that all stopped. You
          stopped that. You decided it was
          okay to put an end to that. Black
          stones. Go on.
                        FAIT
          I need 'em back.
                        CHAMBERS
          Only smart thing was not pimping her
          yourself, 'cause then I'da been real
          sore-angry, and you'da both been real
          cold-dead...
                        CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
          But you don't pimp, do you? Just a

                                                              43.
          thief in the night. Stealing what
          don't belong to you.
Chambers turns to Su.   In SUBTITLED KOREAN --
                        CHAMBERS
          You like tall white women?
Su doesn't say anything.   Back to English --
                        CHAMBERS
          He can't talk?
                        SU
          I don't speak Korean.

Chambers carves up a sausage.
                        CHAMBERS
          Bought myself this Korean club
          downtown. Packing in the Seoul
          brothers 24-7-365... Black man
          gouging Koreans, ain't that a
          switch... Motherfuckers got faces
          like walls, but they love to drink
          liquor and look at naked girls...
          Place is no shitbox, either. Got me
          an office looks like a kabuki love
          palace. My own little sanctuary --
A QUICK SHOT OF Fait, taking this in.
                        CHAMBERS
          -- just waiting for when I parole
          out... Stop by sometime, eyeball the
          poon.
                        FAIT
          ... Jump, my daughter's mixed up in
          this. I gotta have the stones, or
          she's dead.
No response.   Chambers just keeps eating.
                        FAIT
          If you need something more than that,
          here it is...
                  (this is hard)
          I'm begging you, Jump.
Still no response... Chambers finishes eating.    Wipes his
face. Finally --
                       CHAMBERS
          Big heist. Risky heist. Breaking
          news. I'm watching it wondering why.

                                                                44.
          What's worth that kind of trouble,
          that kind of heat? Gotta be
          something good. Gotta be something
          expensive.
Beat.   He meets Fait's eyes.   Holds them.

                        FAIT
          She's my little girl.
                         CHAMBERS
          Make another one... Lotta offspring
          running around. Big scores're rare
          in a lifetime.
Another beat.   That's it.   No deal.

Fait takes a sudden step toward Chambers.     Su stops him.
                        CHAMBERS
          Slope's no dope.
He indicates behind them. They turn. The two cell sentries
are wielding prison shanks. So is Willy Chickens.
                         CHICKENS
          Let me cut one of these
          motherfuckers.
                         CHAMBERS
          Your choice.
Chickens is happy.   Thrusts the knife at Fait.       When...
Su reaches out and catches the   blade.  Catches it with just
the thumb and forefinger of one   hand.  And holds it like
that. Holds it hard. Chickens     can't push and can't pull.
Doesn't know what to do next.    Finally yanks really hard.
And...
Su lets go. Chickens goes backward, ass over teakettle. A
beat. Then, to Fait --
                        CHAMBERS
          Say hey to Daria. And don't forget
          your shoes.

EXT. PRISON - DAY
Fait and Su walk toward the Porsche.
                        FAIT
          I used to look up to that guy.      All I
          wanted was to be like him.

                                                            45.
                       SU
         In Taiwan, I could force him to talk.
                        FAIT
         This ain't Taiwan.
                 (then)
         Only thing we can do now is find out
         where the stones are and go take 'em.
                       SU
         You make it sound easy.
                        FAIT
         It won't be.
They're about to get in the car. Fait stops.     Looks back at
the prison. Suddenly realizing something.
                       FAIT
         ... They're at his club.
                       SU
         How do you know?
                        FAIT
         I know. I can feel it.      That ever
         happen to you?
                        SU
         No.
                       FAIT
         I thought Chinese people were all
         mystical and shit.
                       SU
         We like to gamble.     Not guess.
                       FAIT
         It's no guess... But I could be
         wrong... We'll hit the club. You
         gotta see Archie.
                        SU
         Archie?
                       FAIT
         He's gotta remember something about
         the guys who took down his place.
                       SU
         What if he can't?
                       FAIT
         Pretend it's Taiwan.    Make him
         remember.

                                                          46.


INT. HANGAR - DAY
RUSSELL, the science and technology end of Ling's operation,
carries a piece of equipment from the back of a five-ton
truck and approaches some kind of strange contraption, which
he's in the process of erecting in the middle of the hangar.
He puts down what he's carrying next to the contraption and
starts back for something else, when he sees Charles is
looking in the back of the truck.
                          RUSSELL
          Hey!    Get away from there!
Russell hurries over, extremely edgy, almost manic.

                        RUSSELL
          What are you doing?!
                        CHARLES
          Whoa. Take it easy. Just seeing if
          I could help with something.
                        RUSSELL
          You can't! It's very delicate
          equipment! Stay away! Just stay
          away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
                        RUSSELL
          Stay away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
                        RUSSELL
          Stay away from my truck!
                         CHARLES
          What?
Sona's emerging from a trailer/office nearby.
                         SONA
          Stop it.
Charles does. And now we can hear Vanessa, who's begun
screaming inside the camper.
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy!
Charles backs up, continuing to address Russell --

                                                            47.

                        CHARLES
          I'm backing away... I'm backing
          away...
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Charles joins Sona.   Re:   Russell --
                        CHARLES
          Someone give the geek his Ritalin.
                        SONA
          At least he's doing his job. Which
          is more than I can say for some
          people.
                        VANESSA (O.S.)
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!
Sona tosses Charles a roll of duct tape.
                        SONA
          Tape her up and gag her.
As Vanessa continues to SCREAM, Charles moves to the van,
unlocks the rear door with the key/remote and pockets it.
Then opens the door. And...
Vanessa bolts out, crying, and clamps her arms around his
waist.
                         VANESSA
          I want my daddy! I want my daddy!    I
          want my daddy!
                        CHARLES
          Get the hell off me.
He pries loose her arms from around him. Keeping a grip on
her wrists with one hand, Charles turns her around to face
away from him. He's about to start duct-taping her wrists.
                        CHARLES
          ... Waste of time... I can think of a
          better way of shutting you
          up --
Vanessa back-kicks him hard in the 'nads.   Charles howls in
pain and lets her go.
Quickly, Vanessa jumps back inside the camper.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION

                                                           48.

Vanessa slams the sliding rear door shut. And now... We
suddenly realize she has the key and remote! The crying
just an act she put on to pickpocket Charles. Vanessa pushes
the remote. And...


EXT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
THUNK go the DOOR LOCKS. Charles, still in pain, is
surprised to hear this. Feels his pocket. Realizes the key
and remote are gone.
                        CHARLES
          Shit.
                  (yells to Sona)
          She got the key!

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa climbs into the driver's seat. Puts the key into
the ignition and STARTS the ENGINE. Puts it in "D."

CLOSEUP - ACCELERATOR PEDAL
To reveal Vanessa's rigged a soda can to the pedal. An
extension for her short legs. As her foot tromps down on the
can...

ANGLE - CAMPER
takes off. The windows are blacked out and Vanessa can't
see where she's going. But she's going.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The camper careens around the large space.   Charles
scrambles after.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa keeps driving blind, pedal to the metal.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
The CAMPER veers toward the rear wall.   And...
... CRASHES into a support post.
As Charles yanks Vanessa from the wrecked van, unhurt...

                                                           49.


INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
A hostess bar, but very high-end. Beautiful women. Elegant
decor. Pumping MUSIC. No strip-club cheese. For extra
money, private rooms for private pleasures. It's day, but
the place is wall-to-wall with Korean men.
Chambers' African-Americans maintain low visibility:   at the
door, behind the scenes, counting the register, etc.
ODION, a dangerous-looking Chambers main man, moves through
the crowd to Daria, waiting near the front door.
                        ODION
          Delicious Daria.
                         DARIA
          'Sup, Odion?
                        ODION
          Long time no see.
Then, checking her out --
                         ODION
          Like cognac. Just getting better.
                  (then)
          So what brings you around?
                        DARIA
          ... Sometimes you need an old friend,
          y'know?
                         ODION
          Got trouble?
                        DARIA
          ... With a capital 'T.'
                       ODION
          Tony Fait? Thought you and him were
          tight. Bonnie and Clyde.
                        DARIA
          Used to be that way. Not treating me
          right these days. The kid's all he
          cares about.
                        ODION
          ... What do you want me to do?
                        DARIA
          ... Man, I don't know. Probably
          nothing you can do. I just

                                                     50.
          thought...
                  (then)
          Hey, y'know, this is crazy. I don't
          know what I was thinking. I
          shouldn't even be here like this.
          Sorry, Odion.

Daria starts to go.   Odion stops her.
                        ODION
          Nah, hey, hold up. It's okay.
                        DARIA
          Back in the day... Just always seemed
          like you and I had something special
          between us.

                        ODION
          Didn't know you thought so.
                        DARIA
          I always cared for you, Odion.
          That's why I'm here.
                        ODION
          ... You looking for a job?
                        DARIA
          I need something.
                        ODION
          ... So maybe you could work here.
                        DARIA
          Here?... Oh, man, I don't know.
                        ODION
          You were the best. Not many girls
          pulling in two g's a night.
                        DARIA
          Yeah, but it's been a while for
          that... Might not remember how.
                        ODION
          Just like a bicycle, baby.     You don't
          forget that stuff.
Daria considers it a moment.
                        DARIA
          Don't know how Jump'd feel about it.
          Having me back.
                        ODION
          Hey, you let me worry about Jump,

                                                            51.
          okay?
                  (then)
          Meantime, why don't you come on in,
          and you and me can, y'know, talk some
          more about it.

Beat.   Daria knows the look in his eyes.   Gets the subtext.
                         DARIA
          ... Just talk?
Odion's drinking her in.
                         ODION
          ... No.

A beat. Then, as Daria reaches out and slips her hand into
Odion's, smiling at him --

INT. SU'S T-BIRD - DAY
Su and Archie.
                        SU
          They have boxing matches in the day?
                        ARCHIE
          Not exactly boxing. More dangerous.
          No gloves. No rules. Big money.
          Very illegal... Started holding 'em
          during the daytime to fool the cops.
                        SU
          The man you remembered -- how do you
          know he will be here?
                         ARCHIE
          I don't. But Chambers owns the
          operation, so I figure it's a good
          place to start.
                  (then)
          This is it.
They turn into...

EXT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
A cavernous industrial building.   Cars parked on the
perimeter.

INT./EXT. SU'S T-BIRD - CONTINUOUS ACTION
As they park --

                                                            52.

                        SU
          How will you recognize him?
                        ARCHIE
          I didn't see his face.   But I'll know
          his pinkie ring when I  see it. Ten
          carats. Round cut with   square mount.
          Good color and clarity.   I remember
          thinking what it would  do to my face
          if he hit me.
OFF Su's dubious look, as Archie crams on a baseball hat to
help disguise himself...


INT. FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Archie and Su exit the car and approach a GUARD manning a
gate to the fight arena beyond.
                        SU
          How do we get in?
                        ARCHIE
          Leave that to me.
Then, to the Guard --
                        ARCHIE
          Hey, man, how you doing? Got a
          fighter here I want to enter.
Su shoots him a surprised look.
                        ARCHIE
          My man's gonna put the rest of these
          bums to beddy-bye. He'll go in there
          and get all Chinese on 'em -- the
          teeth are gonna fly, the blood's
          gonna run... Gonna be fun.
                        GUARD
          Whatever... You're number twelve,
          Bruce.
He hands a card reading "12" to Su. As Archie and Su make
their way toward the arena --
                        SU
          I didn't come here to fight.
                        ARCHIE
          You won't have to. That was just to
          get us in.

                                                                  53.
They reach the arena. It's also huge. Packed with men.
Hazy with smoke. Loud with betting, cheers and boos.
A large, chain-link cage stands at the center of the room.
Inside, two battered and bloodied fighters are beating the
shit out of each other.

Like at    a Gallagher concert, front row fans have sheets of
plastic    over their laps. Whenever a hard kick or punch
lands,    the nearest fans quickly raise the plastic sheets to
shield    themselves from flying blood.
                          ARCHIE
            Good day, over a million dollars'll
            pass hands in here.

                             SU
            Find the ring.
                             ARCHIE
            Yeah.    Okay.
He looks around.      Lotta African-American males.
                          ARCHIE
            Could take a little while.
As Archie starts moving through the crowd, looking at hands,
and Su follows...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria and Odion enter, and Odion closes the door. He starts
to take her in his arms. Daria slows him up. Guides him
back toward a sofa.
                             DARIA
            Sit down.
Odion sits.
                          DARIA
            Put on some music.
Odion puts a DISC in the STEREO.        Cranks up some HIP-HOP.
                            DARIA
            Nah.    Something slower.
Odion SWITCHES MUSIC.        A SLOW TUNE fills the room.
                          DARIA
            That's good... Now just relax... And
            watch...

                                                            54.
Daria just stands there a moment, getting her body into the
music. Then starts dancing for him. Slow and sexy.
And Odion's eating it up.


EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
Fait and Miles climb onto the roof with gear bags.   Via
earwig mike --
                            FAIT
          Tommy.

INT./EXT. PEST CONTROL TRUCK - DAY

Tommy's behind the wheel, wearing a pest control uniform.
                        TOMMY
          Here come da bug man.

EXT. KOREAN CLUB - STREET IN FRONT - DAY
The DOORMAN watches Tommy drive up in the pest-control
truck, put on a respirator, get out, unreel 20 feet of pest
spray hose from the truck and advance toward the door.
                            TOMMY
          Hey.    Howzit?
                        DOORMAN
          What the hell you doing?
                        TOMMY
          Pest control. Don't tell me you
          didn't get your notice.
                            DOORMAN
          What notice?
                        TOMMY
          See, that burns my ass right to the
          bone. I mean, hey, I'm here doing my
          job... Anyway, putting that aside, if
          you had gotten your notice, you'd
          know there's a new city ordinance
          saying all businesses catering to
          foreigners gotta be sprayed.
                          DOORMAN
          Yeah?    How come?
                        TOMMY
          'Cause foreign people're bringing all

                                                     55.
          their scary-assed foreign bugs over
          here. Y'know, in their luggage and
          shit. And then the bugs're getting
          loose and fucking everything up --
          eating all the trees and everything,
          y'know, making people sick... Anyway,
          city says we gotta spray to prevent
          any infestation and possible spread.
                        DOORMAN
          We're doing business inside. Can't
          let you just start hosing the place
          with bug spray.
                        TOMMY
          Yeah, well, maybe you should at least
          ask the manager about it.
                        DOORMAN
          Manager's busy.
                        TOMMY
          ... Okay. Your call. Just know the
          city quarantine people'll be here
          first thing tomorrow.
                        DOORMAN
          Quarantine people?
                        TOMMY
          They'll be shutting you down for non-
          compliance... Peace out.
Tommy starts to go.
                        DOORMAN
          Wait, wait, wait.
Tommy stops.
                        DOORMAN
          City's really gonna come and close us
          up?
                        TOMMY
          Quicker'n a Zip-loc.
                        DOORMAN
          ... You sure you're not fucking with
          me?
                        TOMMY
          I'm a licensed exterminator.   Why
          would I be fucking with you?
The Doorman considers it another moment.   Then --

                                                              56.

                        TOMMY
          Look. Let's do this. You let me
          start with a couple small rooms,
          y'know, offices or something,
          someplace you don't have customers.
          Upstairs, so the fumes don't bother
          anybody. I'll pop off a couple bug
          bombs, and then we'll do the rest
          later. How's that?
The Doorman considers a moment.     Then --
                        DOORMAN
          ... Yeah, okay. Get the bombs, and
          come on.


INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria keeps dancing. Peeling off layers now.    Showing skin.
Odion's starting to salivate.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
What Chambers' cell is to a normal cell, this place is to a
normal office. No expense spared. (Think Joel again.) A
large, "Zen" FOUNTAIN BURBLES meditatively in the center of
the room.
The door opens.   The Doorman admits Tommy, who looks around
in amazement.

                          TOMMY
          ... Look.   At.   This.
                        DOORMAN
          Just do your thing and go,
          bro.
                          TOMMY
          Roger that.
He positions the BUG BOMBS. Then.... PFFFT.     He sets off
one. PFFFT. The other. As he goes --
                        TOMMY
          Just keep the door closed and be sure
          to give this shit a full hour before
          anyone comes in.
OFF the closing door...

                                                              57.
EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
Fait and Miles grab gear bags and mobilize. Clip onto
ascender/descenders and lower themselves to a second-story
window. A window into...


INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away.
Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it.
BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs
and toss them out.
As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out
a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room
quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS
from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something
bigger.
BLEEE.   He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk.
                             FAIT
             Safe.
He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And...
There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure.
                             FAIT
             Take it down.
Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A
big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50
cal."

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and
sexy for Odion.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the
Barrett.
                           MILES
             Even with the music, they're gonna
             hear it when I fire this tank buster.
                             FAIT
             Daria.   Get ready to move.
                      (then)

                                                                58.
          Do it.
Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.      Miles
FIRES. BIG BANG.


INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY
Odion starts.
                          ODION
          What was that?

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY

Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by
the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.       Looks back at
Daria. A realization dawning.
                        ODION
          'Sometimes you need an old friend'...
He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens
the door.
A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion.
                        CHAMBERS MAN
          It came from the office.
                         ODION
          Watch her.   Don't let her leave.
Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at
Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
Fait's tossed the safe.     No stones.
                          MILES
          Not here?
                          FAIT
          They're here.    Somewhere else.
                        MILES
          What're you talking about?

                                                              59.
                         FAIT
           I'm telling you, they're here.
                         MILES
           What're we gonna do?

                           FAIT
           Everyone out.
Fait's started searching the room.       Tearing it apart.
                         MILES
           What about you?
                         FAIT
           I gotta save Vanessa.     I gotta find
           'em.
                         MILES
           I'm not leaving you.
                           FAIT
           Yes, you are.    Go.   Now.
Someone starts RATTLING the LOCKED DOOR.      Fait doesn't stop.
                        MILES
           T. Come on, man. They're outside.
           Give it up.
                         FAIT
           Shut up and get the fuck outta here!
           That's an order!
Miles hesitates. Fait's unreachable. Chambers' men are
trying to break down the door. Miles goes. Out the window.
Onto the ascender-descender. And gone.

INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT
Daria finishes dressing.     When...
                         CHAMBERS MAN
           ... Y'know, I got the big one...
Her response is a front kick to the head. Followed by a
spin kick, knocking him out. Then, stepping past him --
                         DARIA
           Keep it in your pants.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY
CRASH!   Odion and his men break down the door.

                                                               60.

Fait's still searching. Desperate to find the stones.
Desperate to save his daughter. He fights off the first
men to reach him. A wild animal. Fights off another. And
then...

The guns are out.     All pointed at Fait. No stones. No exit.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
Daria walks out the front door.

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY

Willy Chickens hovers near Chambers, who is talking as he
eats another meal. Lobster. At first, we don't realize who
Chambers is addressing.
                        CHAMBERS
          ... If you're willing to pay five,
          you're willing to pay ten.
                           CHAMBERS (CONT'D)
          You're    willing to pay ten, you're
          willing    to pay twenty. Twenty,
          forty.     Forty, eighty... I'm not
          selling    till I know exactly where the
          ceiling    is.
Whereupon we see who he's talking to:     Ling.
                        CHAMBERS
          You like foreplay?
                        LING
          How much money do you want for the
          stones?
                         CHAMBERS
          I hate foreplay. Fuck the warm-up
          drills -- girl's gotta get in there
          and be ready to score points. Bring
          it straight to the motherfucking
          hoop. You understand?
                  (beat)
          So, instead of us going back and
          forth doing warm-ups, my idea's for
          you to think of a number. A very
          high number. A very final number. A
          number so high and final it'll get me
          off good, bam, right when I hear it.
Chambers hasn't looked at Ling the whole time.       Still isn't
looking. Forks up some lobster meat. When...

                                                             61.

Chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. And...
Ling slams a lobster claw deep into Chickens' neck. Chambers
doesn't wait for whatever's next. Jumps back. Fast for a
big man.

But Ling is much faster. Stronger. Deadlier. Quickly, and
quietly beats Chambers like a drum. Chambers knows when it's
finally tent-folding time. Croaks surrender through the
blood and swelling --

                          CHAMBERS
          Okay, okay...
Ling stops.

                        CHAMBERS
          Ain't worth my life... I'll take the
          five and call it a game.

INT. CELLBLOCK - OUTSIDE CHAMBERS' CELL - MOMENTS LATER
Ling emerges from the cell through the blankets. Closing
the blankets behind him. To the sentries, who've heard
nothing --
                         LING
          Mr. Chambers is resting.   He says not
          to bother him.
OFF which, as Ling walks away...

INT. CHAMBERS' CELL - DAY
FIND Chambers. No one will bother him. Ever.       The lobster
fork driven deep into the base of his skull.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
Archie still looking for the man with the diamond
pinkie-ring. Su still following.
                        ARCHIE
          ... By the way, when we do find him,
          what then?
                        SU
          I'll handle it.
In the cage, a fight has just ended. The loser's
unconscious and looks like he stepped into a spinning
airplane propeller. The winner doesn't look much better.

                                                            62.
The midget RING ANNOUNCER steps in with a mike.
                        RING ANNOUNCER
          Seven advances, eleven's out...
          Next up, eight versus twelve. Eight
          versus twelve. Fighters report to
          the cage.
As Archie and Su continue the search --
                        ARCHIE
          You're after the stones, too, huh?
No response from Su.   Beat.
                        ARCHIE
          ... I did some more checking around
          to see what anyone knows about 'em...
          Guess who get back to me? My Defense
          Department connection. Now, I think
          he's calling me about this surplus F-
          14 Tomcat I'm trying to get my hands
          on. But no. Turns out he's calling
          to tell me about a rumor outta Taiwan
          about black stones --
In the ring, we see another bruiser waiting to fight as the
midget calls out --
                         RING ANNOUNCER
          Number twelve!
                        ARCHIE
                  (to Su)
          -- only they're not jewels --
                         RING ANNOUNCER
          Number twelve!
                         ARCHIE
          They're --
Suddenly, seeing the "12" card in Su's hand, a FIGHT CLUB
FAN grabs his arm and raises it. Yells out --
                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
          Twelve's right here!
Su pulls his arm back.
                        FIGHT CLUB FAN
          I'd be scared of him, too.
Su glances into the ring, seeing the BRUISER for the
first time. The Bruiser's beckoning.

                                                            63.
                        BRUISER
          Let's go, chickenshit!
Su waves them off.
                          SU
          Not today...
The catcalls start.    Archie leans into Su.
                           ARCHIE
          I know it    wasn't the plan. But if
          you don't    fight, they're gonna toss
          us out on    our asses. We might never
          find the    guy.

A long beat.    Su hates this place.   Su hates Archie.

INT. KOREAN CLUB - DAY
Fait's in handcuffs. A big cut on his head. Being escorted
by two COPS to the stairs leading out of the club. To
Odion, as they pass him --
                        COP #1
          He's pretty beat up.
                        ODION
          Yeah. Fell down the stairs... Enjoy
          the jail sex, Fait.
As they continue up the stairs --
                        COP #2
          Better have the E.M.T.s look at his
          head.

EXT. HOT DOG STAND (NEAR KOREAN CLUB) - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Near, but not too close. The club visible in b.g. Daria,
Miles, and Tommy watch as Fait is led into an ambulance.
Via earwigs --
                        DARIA
          We're still here to help you, T.
                        MILES
          Anything you want us to do?

INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's heard.
                          FAIT

                                                               64.
          Not yet.
The PARAMEDIC treating him doesn't understand.
                         PARAMEDIC
          What?

                         FAIT
          Nothing.

CLOSEUP - BEHIND FAIT'S BACK
His cuffed hands.    Fingers feeling the inside of his belt.
Finding a spot where a small rectangle has been cut into the
leather. Popping out the rectangle to reveal a hollowed-out
recess in the belt. Where...
Fait has a hidden handcuff key.

CLOSEUP - ANOTHER SET OF HANDS
struggling against their duct-tape bonds.   REVEAL...

INT. CAMPER - DAY
Vanessa's hands are taped together behind her back. There's
tape around her feet. Tape over her mouth. The TV is ON
nearby, but she's not watching.
Vanessa struggles a moment longer, but can't break the tape.
Finally gives up trying. Just lies there. Tired and
scared.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
DING! The crowd's yelling and betting as number eight
leaves his corner and advances on Su.
Su has nothing against number eight. He's just trying to
buy time. So he dodges his opponent. Not exactly
running. Fighting by not fighting. A target one moment,
gone the next. Again and again, number eight swings and
misses. Until...
Number eight delivers a knockout blow. Unfortunately
it's against himself. The momentum of a missed punch
carries him headfirst into a metal post.
Number eight drops. As the referee counts over number eight,
Su uses the chance to find...

                                                             65.

ARCHIE
still checking out the hands of African-American men in
the crowd. Not making any friends as he does it.


SU
Number eight's on his feet.    Moving in again.   When...

ARCHIE
Suddenly, he sees it.    The ring.


SU
dodges number eight again. Then... Sees Archie signaling
he's found the guy. And... Gets nailed by number eight. A
solid hit. Exciting the crowd and pumping up number eight.
Whereupon... Su turns to him and bows.
                          SU
          You win.
Su turns, heads out of the cage. The crowd roaring its
disapproval. As... The midget Ring Announcer bars Su's
path.
                          RING ANNOUNCER
          No quitting.    Get back in there.
Su moves him aside. The midget resists. Five other waiting
fighters come to the midget's aid. Forcing Su back into the
cage. Where... It's now Su against them all.

HOT DOG STAND - DAY
Daria, Tommy and Miles wait. Two     extreme MOTO-RIDERS
dressed in leathers have pulled up    in a truck and gotten out
to eat. In the back of the truck     is a motorcycle and a
four-wheel ATV. The two men Ogle     Daria. To her --
                          MOTO-RIDER #1
          Looking good.
She ignores them.     To each other, so she can hear --
                          MOTO-RIDER #2
          Nice rack.
                        MOTO-RIDER #1
          Like the upstairs, like the basement,

                                                              66.
          too.
                        DARIA
          Shut up, assholes...


INT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait's heard. Looks past the Paramedic. Past the Cops
talking outside. Sees the hot dog stand in b.g. Sees the
truck with the motorcycle and ATV parked near the stand. The
Paramedic finishes bandaging Fait. To the cops outside --
                        PARAMEDIC
          He's all patched up.

A Cop calls inside to Fait.
                           COP #1
          Let's go.
Fait stands.     Starts out.   Into his mike --
                        FAIT
          Get ready to move.
And we see...
The handcuffs aren't on him anymore.

EXT. AMBULANCE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait reaches the rear doorway.      When...
He jumps. Knocks one Cop down.      Shoves another aside.   And
takes off running.
Fait's caught the cops completely by surprise. It takes a
few moments before the cops give chase, some on foot, others
by car.

ANOTHER ANGLE
Fait runs toward the truck parked by the hot dog stand.
To Daria, Miles and Tommy, looking on --
                           FAIT
          Get the car.     Stay close.
As Daria, Miles and Tommy quickly mobilize, Fait jumps into
the bed of the truck. Jumps on the ATV. IGNITION.
The Moto-Riders suddenly realize what's happening.

                                                           67.

                          MOTO-RIDER #1
          Hey!
Too late. Fait blasts out of the rear of the truck.   Right
through the nylon mesh tailgate.

Fait flies from the truck bed. Lands on the hood of a
police car. Gets big air off the windshield. Clears the
rest of the car and grabs pavement with all four wheels.
As Fait tears off, and cop cars follow, one of the Moto-
Riders jumps into the bed of the truck and climbs aboard the
remaining motorcycle. His friend calls to him --
                        MOTO-RIDER #1
          Don't let that fucker get away!
The Moto-Rider FIRES UP the MOTORCYCLE. Drops it into
first. Dittoes Fait's leap out the back and SCREAMS off in
pursuit.

INT. CAMPER - DAY
Vanessa still taped up.    TV still ON.   When...
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... We go now to this breaking
          story...
ANGLE TO INCLUDE TV
Airing a chopper shot tracking Fait on the ATV.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... You're watching a man on an all-
          terrain vehicle leading police in a
          high-speed chase through downtown Los
          Angeles. An L.A.P.D. spokesman says
          the man, Anthony Fait --
Vanessa looks over in surprise.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
           -- commandeered the A.T.V. after
          escaping from police officers while
          being treated at a local hospital for
          injuries resulting from his earlier
          arrest for robbery... And this is
          certainly one of the wildest chases
          we've witnessed here in L.A...

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

                                                               68.
WHOOOM! Fait's flying. Seventy-plus. Down streets,
sidewalks, squeezing through places police cars can't.
Over, under, around, through -- doesn't matter. The ATV's
fast, strong and maneuverable.


One problem: so is the moto-cross bike.     The guy's right on
Fait's ass. Matching move with move.
Overhead, police choppers follow Fait's every move. While
on the ground other police vehicles move to block his path.
But whenever Fait meets a roadblock, he somehow finds an
escape. At one point, he uses an outdoor escalator. At
another point he blasts through the Hotel Bonaventure.
This'll be a news highlight for days to come.


INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
The place is bedlam. In the crowd, bets are going down on
the battle royal, now in full effect inside the cage. Su
versus the five fighters. And the midget.
The different fighters use different fighting styles against
Su. Kickboxing, grappling, aikido, kali, American street
fighting...
Su uses all his own skills and whatever's at hand. At one
point he engineers it so one opponent turns on another
opponent. At another point, Su wields the midget like a
fighting staff.
One by one, Su starts reducing the opposition.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
Fait's everywhere.   And so is the moto-bike.   Still on his
tail.
Fait veers inside a building.   The bike follows.

INT. BUILDING - VARIOUS SHOTS - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Fait and the moto-bike ascend the stairs.   One floor.   Two
floors. Up and up.
Fait reaches the top-floor hallway.   Nowhere left to go
except...
Out the window at the end.   And...
That's just where he goes.

                                                              69.
And where he goes, the moto-bike goes.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS
The ATV and the moto-bike make the first leap.    Onto the
roof of a next-door building.
From there, it's rooftop to rooftop.    Jump after jump.
Longer and longer. Until...
The MOTO-BIKE eats it in a spectacular CRASH.     The moto-
rider walks away, but his chase is over.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY

Fait's ATV SCREAMS down another street, still chased by
cops. Into his mike --
                          FAIT
           Yo.

INT. DARIA, MILES AND TOMMY'S CAR - DRIVING - DAY
                          DARIA

                         FAIT
           Above ground parking garage in
           Chinatown?
                          MILES
           Know it.
                          FAIT
           Get there.

INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
It's down to Su and the kick boxer.    The kick boxer spins
and kicks and punches, and...
Su just ties the guy up in his own clothes.    Ties him into a
pretzel. Cinches him tight. Then...
Looks for Archie.     Can't find him. Can't find the guy
wearing the ring.     And hurries out of the cage.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY
Fait jukes the ATV in the entrance.    Up the spiral ramp.

                                                             70.

Moments later, police CARS SKID up and seal the entrance.

INT. CAMPER - DAY

On TV, a chopper shot of the garage surrounded by police.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... And it looks like this chase will
          end here, as police seal off the
          building...
OFF Vanessa, watching...


INT. FIGHT CLUB - DAY
Su runs into the parking area. Archie's in the T-bird.
Sitting, a little unnaturally in the front.
                         SU
          Where is he?
                        ARCHIE
          Decided to leave early.
                         SU
          Where'd he go?
                         ARCHIE
          Right here.
Su looks inside the car.

ANGLE - CAR
Where Archie sits atop the man with the diamond pinkie ring.
Holding a STUN GUN to the guy's cheek.
                        ARCHIE
          Good thing I brought my stunner.
He ZAPS the air.    Then puts it back to the guy's cheek.
                        ARCHIE
          Okay, bud, wanna start the Q and A?

INT. CAMPER - DAY
On TV, the chopper zooms in on a familiar car, as it rolls
down the exit ramp toward the police barricade.

                                                                71.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... Here's a car coming down the exit
          ramp...
We see the police approach the car.

                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... The police apparently talking to
          the driver...
The police let the car pass.
                        TV ANCHOR (V.O.)
          ... Now letting this car drive on as
          the search inside continues...

Vanessa notices something about the car.     Looks carefully.
When...
The car turns, giving the news chopper a better zoom angle
of the people inside, and...
Vanessa sees Daria, Miles and Tommy.
Which could mean only one thing:    her daddy's safe.   And
soon he'll be coming to get her.
With a rekindled hope inspired by her father's escape,
Vanessa now looks for a way to free herself from her duct-
tape bonds. When, just as it's about to seem hopeless
again, her eyes go to...
Her necklace.   The chain and pink diamond pendant.
Vanessa bends over    and lowers her head until the necklace
slides off onto the    bed. Then turns around and  picks up the
necklace behind her    back. Holding it as taut as  she can
between her hands,    she begins sawing away at the tape around
her wrists.

EXT. NEAR KOREAN CLUB - HOT DOG STAND - NIGHT
The gang's all here.    All eyes on the club.
                        FAIT
          I knew the stones were in there.
                        TOMMY
          Question is, how do we get 'em out?
          Place is slamming nonstop.
A long beat.    Fait doesn't answer.
                        SU
          Something isn't right.

                                                                  72.

                         FAIT
          Yeah.   That's what I'm getting.
                          SU
          The doorman.


                         FAIT
          ... Where the hell is he?
                  (then)
          Everyone stay put.
OFF which, as he and Su go --


INT. KOREAN CLUB - UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
MUSIC pumps downstairs as Su and Fait cautiously move down
the hall toward Chambers' office.
                        FAIT
          No Chambers' guys.     I don't get it.
They reach the closed office door, where they stop and
listen. Hear nothing.
Su and Fait exchange a "ready-ready" look.     Then Su opens
the door.

INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Su and Fait enter, unchallenged, to find...
Odion and the other Chambers' men.    Dead.   Skull shot.
                          FAIT
          I get it now.
Su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the Zen fountain,
where he reaches into the water and begins searching the
rocks lining the bottom. Beat. Then --
                        FAIT
          Are they there?
Su doesn't answer, still searching.
                        FAIT
          No. This can't fucking happen.      They
          gotta be there.
Another beat. Then, at last, Su holds something up:         one
black stone. It takes Fait a moment to understand.

                                                                 73.
                              FAIT
             ... What?     That's it?
                           SU
             The rest are gone.

Fait can't believe it.
                           FAIT
             ... What the hell happened?        Who got
             'em?
                             SU
             ... Ling.
                           FAIT
             How do you know?
                             SU
             I know.
                           FAIT
             ... How'd he get here before us?
                             SU
             He's good.
Beat.   Failure.       Summed up in one word:
                           FAIT
             Vanessa...
                     (then, trying)
             He has the stones. There's      no reason
             to keep her. Hell, she's a      little
             girl, she's eight years old     -- she
             can't hurt him. He can let      her go...
             He can just fucking let her     go...
Su just looks at him.        Not a chance.   And he knows Fait
knows it, too.
It's over.     For Fait, it's as if his life just ended.
                           FAIT
             ... What the hell am I gonna do?
                           SU
             ... We need to go.
Fait doesn't move. Then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage,
and Fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the
fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of
exotica, destroying it.
Beat.   Fait looks at Su, who meets his eyes.          Then --

                                                            74.
                         SU
          Come on.
OFF which, as Su mobilizes him, and they go...


INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
Ling pours the black stones out on a table.   To Sona and
Charles --
                        LING
          We're back in business.
                       CHARLES
          Good. I don't have to baby-sit much
          longer.
                         SONA
          I hate kids.
                        LING
          Is everything else ready?
                        SONA
          We just have to test the device.
Russell, who's been working on his scientific contraption
nearby, speaks up.
                         RUSSELL
          Dye master oscillator. And not test,
          calibrate. Which I'm now ready to
          do... Goggles.
When the goggles are on, Russell hits a switch.   And...
Inside the contraption, brilliant green laser BEAMS begin
bombarding a sensor. OFF which...

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa succeeds in using the necklace   as a saw to free her
wrists from the duct-tape. She quickly    rips the tape from her
mouth. Untapes her ankles. Then tries     to figure out what to do
next. Begins searching the camper for    anything that might help
her escape or fight. When...
Looking through the glove box, she finds a cell phone. An
old model. So old, it takes her a moment to figure out
exactly what it is. Then she pushes "Power," and...
The phone turns on.    Sort of.

"Low Batt" flashes on the screen.
INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Rock bottom.

Fait's desolate, sitting on the sofa, staring off.      Daria
tries to comfort him, but it doesn't help.
Miles and Tommy stay close and stay silent.
Even Archie's quiet for once.
The only noise is Su, speaking into a cell phone in Chinese
to someone who is obviously his superior.

                        SU
          ... I lost the stones. Ling has
          them... I don't know where he is... I
          have no way to find him... What do
          you want me to do?
Under which, the PHONE begins to RING.    And...
Fait's too upset to care about answering.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa's on the old cell phone.    We hear RINGING on the
other end.
                        VANESSA
          ... Answer, Daddy, answer...

CLOSEUP - PHONE
"Low Batt"... "Low Batt"...

INT. FAIT'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
The PHONE'S still RINGING.    After another moment...
                        MILES
          Want me to get that?
Which finally mobilizes Fait to reach over and answer.
                        MILES
          Hello.
INTERCUT WITH:

                                                               76.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa whispers urgently.
                         VANESSA
          Daddy?
                         FAIT
          Vanessa!
Which gets everyone's attention.
                         VANESSA
          Come get me!   Please!   I want to go
          home!

                        FAIT
          Okay, baby, okay. Just calm down.
Under which, in b.g., Su quickly ends the phone call to his
superior. Still in Chinese --
                        SU
          I'll call you back.
                         FAIT
                  (continuing, to
                   Vanessa)
          Where are you?
                        VANESSA
          I don't know. I'm in a van inside a
          big building. They painted the
          windows. I can't look out.
                         FAIT
          Try.   Try to see something.
Vanessa puts her eye to the window.    Finally finds a small
gap in the paint.

VANESSA'S POV
Few details. Just some chairs and bright green light from
Russell's contraption.

                                                77.
                          VANESSA
          I see chairs.    And there's green
          light.
Fait repeats for the others' benefit.

                        FAIT
          You see chairs and green light?
          Where's the light coming from?
                          VANESSA
          I can't tell.
                          SU
          Is it bright?

                        FAIT
          The green light, baby -- is it
          bright?
                         VANESSA
          Yeah.   Really, really bright.
                        FAIT
                  (to Su)
          It's real bright.
                          VANESSA
          Daddy, hurry!    I'm scared!
                          FAIT
          I know, baby.    Just hang in there

END INTERCUT.
                        FAIT
          ... Vanessa?... Vanessa!... Shit!
Fait slams the phone down in frustration.
But Su's mind is on what she told them.
                        SU
          ... He's doing it here.    Tonight.

                                                  78.
                        TOMMY
          What?
                         SU
          Selling the stones... A dye laser
          emits green light. He needs it to
          activate them.
                        MILES
          What the hell you talking about?
                        DARIA
          What are these stones?
Archie answers it.

                        ARCHIE
          Doomsday in disguise.
All eyes go to him.
                         ARCHIE
          They're some kinda new synthetic
          plutonium. Small and portable, but
          mega-powerful.
                        TOMMY
          This fucker's making bombs?
                        SU
          Not making them.
                        ARCHIE
          Yeah, he'd need a big operation for
          that. Why bother? Just demonstrate
          the stones work and sell 'em to
          whichever international scumbag
          offers the highest bid. He makes
          millions, they make the bombs,
          then... 'look out, world.'
                        FAIT
          ... Okay, so we know what he's up to.
          How's it get us to Vanessa?
Su considers it a moment.
                        SU
          The buyers will want to arrive and
          leave quickly... Somewhere private...
          Accessible by aircraft.
                        FAIT
          Vanessa said she's inside a big
          building. Could be a hangar.

                                                             79.
                        MILES
          Man, there's dozens of little
          airports around here. We'd never get
          to 'em all.
                        SU
          ... Flight plans.
                        ARCHIE
          Hey, yeah. Flight plans show
          destinations. All aircraft file 'em
          with the Aviation Administration. If
          we could get a list, we could maybe
          figure out where the sale's going
          down.

                        FAIT
          ... Daria, call the aviation people.
          Use our L.A.P.D. credentials. We
          need flight plan info for all private
          aircraft in this area tonight...
          Everyone else get ready to move...
          Miles, the no-gun policy's revoked.
          You break out the heat... Tommy, you
          gotta get us a diversion.
                        ARCHIE
          I can help with that.
                        FAIT
          ... Do it all fast.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
Ling, Sona, Charles, and Russell.
Russell finishes testing his contraption.    Switches it OFF.
Then, removing his goggles --
                        RUSSELL
          We're operational.
The others remove their goggles.    Sona checks her watch.
                        SONA
          The buyers arrive in less then an
          hour.
Beat.   Ling holds up a black stone and examines it.
                        LING
          ... So small. So deadly... We're
          selling conscience for money...
A look at the others.   Serious.   Then a broad smile of

                                                             80.
consummate satisfaction suddenly spreads across his face.
                         LING
           ... But it's a lot of money...
Beat.   He puts down the stone.    A glance at the camper.

                         LING
           Be ready to kill the girl and go as
           soon as the sale's over.

           tonight within minutes of each other.
                         DARIA
           Sounds like our best shot.
                         FAIT
           .. It better be, or my baby's dead.
He and Su exchange a look.     Then --

           Let's go.

CORPORATE HELICOPTER - NIGHT
Noselight beaming, the chopper lands next to four other
high-end biz copters, including an Agusta A109, outside the
hangar, where the bruised Ling killers stand guard.

INT. CAMPER - NIGHT
Vanessa peeks through a void in the paint covering the
windows.

                                                            81.

An internationally-diverse group of men -- some occupying
the chairs, some studying the contraption, some clearly
muscle. Across the room, Sona and Ling greet the new
arrivals.

In all, sixteen men have arrived for the sale. There are
five buyers -- one RUSSIAN, one AFRICAN, one PAKISTANI, one
EGYPTIAN, one FRENCH. The French Buyer is in a wheelchair.
Each buyer has brought with him one right-hand man and one
to three bodyguards.
Vanessa SHIFTS her VIEW, REVEALING...
Charles standing nearby.    Too close for her to escape.

Charles turns, and...

BACK TO VANESSA
Quickly, before Charles can see her, she steps away from the
window.
There's no way out.

EXT. FAIT'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
Driving.   Daria and Miles following in their car.

           So tell me... How the hell's Taiwan
           fit into all this?
                         SU (V.O.)
           One of our scientists made the
           stones. Tried to go into business
           for himself. We stopped him.
           Recovered the stones... Ling betrayed
           us. He took them.
                          FAIT (V.O.)
           Ling?   He was one of you?
                         SU (V.O.)
           We were partners. Six of us. He
           killed the others. He thought he
           killed me, too.
                          FAIT (V.O.)
                   (beat)
           So what're you really after -- the
           stones or the payback?
                         SU

                                                            82.
          Both.
                        FAIT (V.O.)
          ... Yeah... Let's get it all.


INT. HANGAR - NIGHT
                        LING
          You're the world's foremost arms
          dealers. You all know that weaponry
          equals power. And in the world of
          weaponry, nukes rule.
                        (MORE)
                        LING (CONT'D)
          But nuclear material is hard to
          obtain and difficult to handle... But
          what if it weren't?... That's the
          question that brought you here
          tonight... And here's the answer.
Ling holds up a single stone.
                        LING
          In its present state, it's completely
          inert. Zero radiation, zero
          volatility...
Whereupon Ling places the stone on a piece of velvet on a
table. Folds the velvet over. Then, whack, hits it hard
with a mallet.
He unfolds the velvet.   The stone's smashed to pieces.
Ling picks up a sliver of stone and hands it to Russell, who
places the sliver inside a small ceramic capsule, then
inserts the capsule into his contraption.
                         RUSSELL
          Goggles on.
Everyone puts on goggles. Then Russell hits the switch, and
the green lasers bombard the capsule containing the sliver
of stone, which begins to glow.
Russell announces each passing threshold as a numerical
readout on the contraption races up the scale --
                        RUSSELL
          ... Firecracker... .44 magnum...
          R.P.G... Sidewinder... SCUD...
          Tomahawk... Daisy Cutter...
          Hiroshima... two Hiroshimas...
And it just keeps going.   Until, finally --

                                                             83.

                         RUSSELL
           ... New World Order.
As the buyers absorb this...

Russell shuts off the beams.
                           RUSSELL
           Goggles off.
Russell removes the capsule and hands it back to Ling, who
holds it up.
                            LING
           One small    fragment. Transformed into
           a source    of immense energy. More
           powerful    than weapons-grade plutonium
           a hundred    times its size.
A beat as this sinks in.
                         SONA
           The purpose of today's sale is to
           begin trading a new commodity on the
           black market and establish its
           value... There are fifty stones
           available in the first sale. The
           opening price is one million per
           stone... Bids, please?
The buyers indicate their bids both aloud and by using hand
signals a la traders in a commodities exchange pit. At the
same time, they're all crunching the numbers on calculators.
Ling looks on as Sona runs the sale, and Russell uses a
laptop to input data and develops supply and demand market-
analysis for Sona to consult.
The pace starts out slowly and unevenly as the buyers feel
out the situation.
                         RUSSIAN BUYER
           Five at one million.
Sona is silent.   Silence means "No."

           We'll take that.
                         FRENCH BUYER
           Six at one-five.

When suddenly...
KA-WHAM! Archie's Abrams TANK BLASTS through a wall and
into the hangar.
Archie's head pops out of the driver's hole. At the same
time, Tommy pops up out of the turret and trains a mounted
machine gun on the stunned group.
                         TOMMY
           Freeze, motherfuckers!

                                                             87.
Russell watches the advancing tank.
                           RUSSELL
            I knew it!   I knew it!


ANGLE - BEHIND TANK
Fait and Daria enter through the hole in the wall using the
Abrams for shelter.

INT. CAMPER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Vanessa peers out through a gap in the paint to see what's
happening.


VANESSA'S POV
Charles is drawn away by the advancing tank.

BACK TO VANESSA
She looks back into the camper. Finds a heavy iron skillet
amid the stove utensils. Swings it. And...
SMASH!    She SHATTERS a side WINDOW.

MILES' SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
We FIND Vanessa, jumping out of the camper.
                          MILES (V.O.)
            Vanessa's out of the camper.   Running
            this way.

INT. HANGAR - FAIT AND DARIA
To Daria --
                          FAIT
            Stay.
And he's gone, sprinting after her just as...

VANESSA
reaches a button for opening and closing the giant hangar
doors. She jabs a button, and the nearest door begins to
motor open.

                                                              88.

CHARLES
hears the OPENING HANGAR DOOR.    Turns.   Sees Vanessa and
goes after her.


SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Vanessa rolls out under the rising door and runs.
                          MILES (V.O.)
          She's out.
Then, FINDING Charles coming after her --

                        MILES (V.O.)
          There's a guy after her.
PHUT!

INT. HANGAR - CHARLES
A BULLET rips through the collar of his leather coat. Just
behind his neck. Just missing him. But he keeps coming.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV (NO NIGHT VISION)
Charles rolling out under the door.

MILES
SHOOTS again.   PHUT!

CHARLES
The BULLET RICOCHETS off the PAVEMENT right next to him. In
a flash, he's up and running. Heading out into the darkness
of the airfield after Vanessa. Meanwhile, back inside...

INT. HANGAR
In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes
its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy
sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group.
                          TOMMY
          Just be cool!
At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck.

                                                             89.
                        TOMMY
          I said don't move, motherfucker!
Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the
back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun.
Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank.
Russell vaults in and takes aim.
                        RUSSELL
          Fucking amateurs!
He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take
big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit.
                        TOMMY
          Shit!   What do we do?

                          ARCHIE
          Shoot back!
                          TOMMY
          How?
The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right
thing. And...
Tommy's MACHINE GUN begins RIPPING CHUNKS out of the FIVE-
TON and EVERYTHING near it. Tommy's a horrible shot; the
gun's more in control of him. But...
Russell finally dies under a HAIL of HEAVY LEAD.
                        ARCHIE
          Twin .50's some major firepower.
          How'd that little shit get one?
                          TOMMY
          Motherfucker.    Couldn't fucking
          listen.
INTERCUT WITH which...

ACROSS HANGAR
Ling and Sona are moving toward the limo. Ling has the
stones. When... Su is there. Blocking the way. Sona
attacks. Su easily blocks the counters. Knocking Sona back.
Never taking his eyes off Ling. When...
Sona, who's fallen back against a buyer's bodyguard, quickly
takes the bodyguard's small, full-auto SCORPION and turns
the gun on Su.
Su dives for cover as the BURST SHREDS the AREA where he'd
just been standing. As Sona continues hunting Su... Su sees

                                                              90.
Ling getting into the limo.    To Archie and   Tommy, as he
signals --
                        SU
          Don't let him get away!

As a result of which...

TOMMY AND ARCHIE
Having just waxed Russell, see Ling in the limo. Tommy's .50
is out of ammo. He switches to the .30 cal. tank's machine
gun. As Archie steers toward the limo, Tommy begins BLASTING
away.


LIMO
Ling's trying to drive out, when the .30 CAL. SLUGS PUNCH
HOLES in the LIMO. The tank keeps coming. Ling bails out as
the TANK CRUSHES the LIMO.
INTERCUT WITH which...

SU AND SONA
Play cat and mouse. Su rapidly runs out of room to hide.
He can't get away. Su stands. Faces her. Faces the
inevitable. When...
WHAM! Daria appears from nowhere. Kicks the gun from
Sona's hand. To Su, re: Ling, now running from the crushed
limo
                          DARIA
          Get him.
Su goes after Ling.
And now it's Daria vs. Sona.
Sona's a better fighter, but Daria's got passion on her
side. It's a good fight. Until, at last, Sona finds the
Scorpion. She swings it up. And...
Daria executes a sudden, improvised double move that strikes
Sona's arm in such a way as to cause her to point the
SCORPION at herself, just as she FIRES. The burst rips
through her chest and kills her.
And now, here's what's been going on outside...

EXT. AIRFIELD

                                                                91.

As Charles runs from the hangar, chasing Vanessa across the
tarmac into the darkness of the airfield...

MILES

flips to NIGHT VISION on the sniper-scope.    And...

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles and Vanessa become clearly visible. Charles is
closing in on her. Cross-hairs FIND him. PHUT!


CHARLES
The BULLET knocks his gun from his hands.    Charles is slowed
but keeps going.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Charles reaches the flight line. Parked planes, a gas
truck, a shed, etc. He disappears behind the equipment.

MILES
sweeps the rifle, looking for Charles and Vanessa.     He comms
Fait.
                        MILES
          Lost 'em behind the gas truck.

CHARLES
stops behind the gas truck.   Looks around for Vanessa.    No
sign of her. Until...
Charles notices the door to the gas truck isn't closed all
the way. He whips it open. And...
There's Vanessa, hiding inside.
Charles grabs her.   Yanks her out struggling and kicking.
                        CHARLES
          Time to end this my way.
And then...
                        FAIT (O.S.)
          Drop the girl.

                                                              92.

Charles looks over.    Fait is there, holding a gun on him.
Vanessa's relieved and excited to see her father.
                          FAIT
          Put her down.
Charles lowers Vanessa to the ground.    He releases her.
                          VANESSA
          Daddy!
Vanessa runs to her father. Dives into his arms. It's a
little more energetic than Fait was expecting. And...

Suddenly, Charles uses the distraction to rush in behind
her. He hits Fait hard. A kick sends the gun flying.
Charles keeps coming. Charles keeps pounding.
Fait's hampered by Vanessa. She won't let him go. Fait
stays between Charles and Vanessa. Guarding his little
girl. Barely managing to fend off Charles, a seemingly
unstoppable force.
The fight winds through the planes, under wings, through
struts.

SNIPER-SCOPE POV - NIGHT VISION
Fait, Charles and Vanessa.    No clear shot.

MILES
comms Fait.
                          MILES
          No shot.

FAIT, CHARLES AND VANESSA
The fight continues.   Fait's suffering under Charles' brutal
attack. When...
Vanessa causes Fait to stumble near a plane.   They fall.
Charles moves in. And...
Fait's hand goes to a set of chocks set against the plane's
wheel. The chocks are two heavy wooden blocks connected by
a length of nylon rope.
Fait turns to Vanessa.

                                                            93.
                         FAIT
          Don't move.
Fait jumps to his feet. Swinging the chocks. Not quite
like nunchakus; more like a medieval mace. And now, all of
Fait's fury comes pouring out as he uses the chocks to beat
the living shit out of Charles. Charles tries to fight
back, but he's out-matched by the chocks and Fait's emotion.
The punishing blows land like Thor's hammer. Until...
A mighty swing nearly takes Charles' head off. Charles is
unconscious before he hits the ground. Fait stands over
Charles. Tosses the chocks down.
                          FAIT
          Wrong kid.    Wrong dad.

Fait turns. He moves back to where Vanessa's still hiding.
He scoops her up. And... Father and daughter hold each
other tight. Forever. During all of which, also INTERCUT...

EXT. HANGAR
Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs
out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the
other, carrying the buyers away.
The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting
for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a
bodyguard.
Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips
over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta.

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head.
                         LING
          Go!

EXT. HANGAR
Su, having left Daria to fight Sona inside, runs out.

EXT. AIRFIELD
The Agusta begins to lift off. Su starts running toward the
helicopter. Runs under the rising aircraft. Jumps. Just
in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels.

                                                                 94.
EXT. AGUSTA
As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to
get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process,
he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly.


INT. AGUSTA
Ling hears the THUMPS.    Looks out.

LING'S POV - SU'S LEG

LING
To the pilot --
                          LING
            Retract the gear!

CLOSEUP - CONTROL PANEL
The pilot hits the wheels-up switch.     And...

SU
The gear begins to retract. Disappearing into the bottom of
the chopper. In a second, there'll be nothing left to hold.
                          SU
            Shoot it down!   Now!
And then... Su lets go.      Drops fifteen feet to the ground.
As...
Behind him, having clanked out of the hangar, the Abrams
tank is stopped. The turret swivels toward the Agusta.

INT. TANK
Archie aims the cannon.

Tommy slides a shell into the breech.

Archie's locked on.     He hits the trigger.   And...

ABRAMS TANK

BOOM!   The big CANNON FIRES.      And...

SKY
The Agusta's tail is BLOWN AWAY by the CANNON SHELL.

INT. TANK

Archie and Tommy exult.
                          TOMMY
            Shot him right in the ass.
                           ARCHIE
            I did it.   I can't believe it.
                          TOMMY
            Thought you said it was no problem.
                          ARCHIE
            What do I know?

INT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT
The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from
crashing.

EXT. AIRFIELD
The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the
hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac,
ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it
caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle
around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING
INTO FLAMES.
The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With
Su in the middle.
The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the
circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside.
Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones.
Su is waiting.
                          LING

                                                          96.
          You were lucky last time.   You
          Won't be lucky again.
The final fight begins.
The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire,
using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the
equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.
For a long time, the fight could go either way. Until...
Ling gets an arm around Su's neck. Like Charles, Su thrashes
and flails. Like Charles, he can't get away.
                        LING
          I'll kill you fast.    You won't
          Feel a thing.

                          SU
          ... I won't.    You will
What happens next happens in an instant:
Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it.
A direction it can't go.
Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP.
Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic
Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from
Ling's pocket. And...
Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags,
choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror-
stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment.
Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese --
                        SU
          This is for our friends.
And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand
blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that...

INSIDE LING'S THROAT
The CERAMIC CAPSULE SHATTERS. Releasing the hot, glowing
white sliver of stone into Ling's windpipe. The fragment's
super high-energy radiation instantly beginning to cook
Ling's body from within. The power of a few thousand
microwave ovens turned on all at once.
Ling's bodily fluids instantly start boiling dry as...

ANGLE BACK ON LING

                                                             97.

As, light beaming from his eyes and mouth, Ling flash-cooks
from the inside out.
Not simply burned. Horribly desiccated. His seared and
darkened skin shrink-wrapped, mummy-like, around his
skeleton. Human jerky.
In a moment, it's finished. Ling's dry-roasted remains
topple over. Su has closed a chapter.

SAME SCENE - MOMENTS LATER
Su and Fait meet on the tarmac. Su has the stones. Fait's
holding Vanessa, asleep in his arms. SIRENS APPROACH in
b.g.
The two men regard each other a moment.
                         FAIT
          We got it all.
                  (then)
          What happens to the stones?
                        SU
          They'll be destroyed.
They see police and emergency vehicles beginning to arrive
in b.g.
                        FAIT
          Looks like I'll be doing some jail
          time.
                       TOMMY
          Jail? Man, you just helped save the
          planet. Law's gotta allow for that.
A look between Fait and Su.   Su nods.
                        SU
          I'll do what I can.
                        ARCHIE
          That's good, 'cause I mean, we make a
          helluva team, y'know?
                  (to Su)
          Well, not you, 'cause you're law
          enforcement. But the rest of us
          -- look, a white guy comes in handy
          now and then. Y'know, if you're
          pulling a job in Beverly Hills or
          ripping off a country club or
          whatever... What kind of percentage
          are we talking?

                                                                98.

                         FAIT
          We're not.
Fait looks at Vanessa again.     Finding a new purpose in her
eyes. Beat.

                        FAIT
          Time I got real.
He regards the others.
                        FAIT
          Time we all did.
                          ARCHIE
          Get real?    What's that mean?
                        TOMMY
          ... Means we're through with that
          life.
Fait's eyes meet Tommy's.     Beat.   Tommy nods.
Fait looks to Daria for her answer.
                        DARIA
          I'm with you, T.
He looks to Miles.
                        MILES
          Whatever you say, man.
Fait looks back to Su.   They hold the look.
                         SU
          ... Good luck.
                         FAIT
          ... Faith.
Another beat. Then they turn and start walking toward the
arriving cop cars. Daria and Miles follow. Archie and
Tommy lag behind. As they all walk away from us --
                        ARCHIE
          What, you're all gonna go straight,
          just like that?
                        TOMMY
          Maybe oughta try it yourself.
                        ARCHIE
          Me? Are you kidding? I've had
          straight jobs. You ever had a

                                                       99.
          straight job?
                        TOMMY
          I had plenty of straight jobs.
                          ARCHIE
          Name one.
                        TOMMY
          I sold Avon door-to-door.
                        ARCHIE
          ... You were an Avon lady?
                        TOMMY
          I was an Avon man. You got a problem
          with that?
                        ARCHIE
          No, it's just, well, uh...
                         TOMMY
          Nah, I'm just fucking with you.
                  (then)
          But my momma did it, and don't you
          dare start disrespecting my momma...
And so on... OFF which, we...

          FADE IN:
                         
          1 INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT (PASADENA, CA) - EVENING 1 
                         
           Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN
           well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON: 
                         
                         
           A PAIR OF FEET
                         
           WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These
           feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.
                         
           PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY 
           (41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O... 
           if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.:
           white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).
                         
           Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu.
                         
                          CAL
           Well, I'm full. You were right,
           hon. I shouldn't have eaten all
           that bread.
                          (THEN)
           Want to just share a dessert?
                         
           Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.
                         
                          CAL
           You okay, babe? You seem out of
           it.
                         
                          TRACY
           Yeah, I'm just thinking about what
           I want.
                         
                          CAL
           Me too. Okay, let's say it at the
           same time. One. Two. Three...
                          TRACY CAL
           I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.

           JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny,
           wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's
           going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet.

           getcha!
                         
           She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with 
           delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the
           nearby console. Jessica picks it up: 
                         
                         
           ON SMASHED PHOTO
                         
           Cal and Tracy. This is their house.

                          JESSICA
           It's okay, my fault.
                          (THEN)
           Alright, kiddo, it's getting late,
           let's get you to bed before your
           parents get home. Don't give me
           the puppy eyes, you little maniac.
           Go brush your teeth!
                         
           Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica
           looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately.

           Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh
           at a table. HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed. 
                          HANNAH
           I don't care. I love him and
           given the opportunity, I'd have
           his babies.
                         
           Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.

                          LIZ
           Yeah, well, you want funny, go
           watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a
           good lay, go get yourself some
           of... that.
                         
           She motions off to the side.
                         
                          HANNAH

           The hot piece that's been checking
           you out for the last hour.
                         
           THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The 
           smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He
           tilts his glass at them, toasting.

           drives.
                         
                          TRACY
           Aren't you going to say anything?
                         
           Nothing.
                         
                          TRACY
           Almost twenty-five years of
           marriage, you have nothing to say?
                         
           She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say
           something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward.
                         
           It's silent. Devastating.

           Meanwhile, Jessica (the baby-sitter) stops at a bedroom
           door. She hears MUSIC coming from inside, puts her ear 
           to the door. It's Lady Gaga. It's awful. 
                         
           She smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time.

           you're seventeen, and I know I
           just turned thirteen, which is the 
           same age as your little brother, 
           and you're technically my baby-
           sitter, but someday soon our age
           difference will be inconsequential
           which is good because...

           Divorce! That's it. Amy heard 
           you crying in the bathroom. We

           Cal is sitting on a plain, faux-modern couch. He's 
           staring into space. A SALESMAN APPROACHES. 
                         
                          SALESMAN 
           Can I help you, sir?

           My wife is sleeping with David 
           Jacobowitz. I need a couch. 
                         
                          SALESMAN 
           Ooh, I understand. Can I give you 
           a word of advice, one divorced man 
           to another? If you don't mind?

           Cal's back at the bar, sipping on his drink. He looks 
           absolutely exhausted. He looks across the bar. 
                         
           At his usual table, Jacob is now wooing a NEW WOMAN. 
                         
           Cal shakes his head, amazed at this guy's chutzpah. A 
           GUY grabs the open bar stool next to Cal. Cal reacts. 
                         
                          CAL 
           Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for 
           a friend. 
                         
                          GUY 
           You've been holding the seat for 
           an hour.

           David Jacobowitz so eat me. 
                         
           The guy shrugs, walks away. Cal looks at his watch, puts 
           a napkin on his drink, and stands. 
                         
          17 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 17 
                         
           Cal pees. Jacob steps INTO FRAME in the adjacent urinal. 
           Cal does a friendly "I'm peeing next to you" nod. Then: 
                          CAL 
           Can't help but notice that you're 
           always surrounded by women. 
           Multiple women.

           Cal's a few drinks in now. The door to the bar opens as 
           BERNIE (late 40s) rushes in. An oak tree of a man. He's 
           carrying a SHOPPING BAG. 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           Sorry I'm late, I had to pick 
           something up from Macy's.

           Don't worry about it, here, sit, 
           I've been guarding this stool with 
           my life. 
                         
           Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable. 
                         
                          CAL 
           It's good to see you, man. I've 
           called you a few times. It's been 
           a rough couple of days, obviously. 
           Nothing I could use more than my 
           old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey, 
           we should play racquetball, when's 
           the last time we played 
           racquetball? 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           Claire won't let me be friends 
           with you anymore. 
                         
           Cal takes this in.

           you and Tracy. I chose you. She 
           said no.

           He pulls a WRAPPED PACKAGE from the bag, hands it to Cal. 
                         
                          BERNIE 
           It's cologne.

           Claire's waiting in the car. 
           Um... there's a gift receipt in 
           there. Sorry. 
                         
           Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder, 
           lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS. 
                         
           Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender. 
                         
                          CAL 
           Do you have anything with a worm 
           in it? Because I'd like a gallon 
           of that now.

           Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get 
           dumped this whole time. 
                         
           He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad
           navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting,
           untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair.
                         
           Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something 
           to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods, 
           gets up and walks away. 
                         
                         
           BACK TO CAL
                         
           As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now 
           showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender.
                         
                          CAL

           A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob.
                         
           Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob
           makes is practiced, perfectly cool.

           offer, it's probably the best
           offer you're ever going to get,
           and you're extremely drunk, so
           it's wildly important that you
           don't answer until I've finished

           process what I'm saying. Do you

           vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-
           year-old girl, wearing a 41R

           You asked me for advice before, 
           Cal, so I'm going to help you. I 
           don't know why. Maybe I'm just
           bored. Maybe all my friends have
           abandoned me for wives and
           children and labradoodle puppies,
           who cares why? Why doesn't
           matter. The point is, you've got
           a good face, and a good head of
           hair, and I'm bored as hell and
           need a project. So if you want,
           I'm going to help you rediscover
           your manhood. Do you remember

           Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal
           goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches
           himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.
                         
                          CAL
           Yeah, okay.

           I'm sorry, what?
                         
           Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby). 
                         
                          JACOB
           You ready to go? 
                         
           She nods, subservient, and follows him out.
                         
           Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the
           rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.

           A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A 
           long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized 
           U-HAUL is parked in the driveway. 
                         
           Cal EXITS the back door, carrying a BOX. He loads it

           A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can 
           tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball 
           equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son 
           catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.

           Cal? 
                         
           Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats. 
           It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward 
           silence. Neither knows what to say.

           Shit. 
                         
           She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells 
           him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops 
           himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and 
           complicated about the reality of it all. 
                         
           Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to 
           lighten things.

           That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a 
           difficult time for you, it's
           important that you find new
           interests, try new things, maybe
           things you'd never have considered
           trying before...
                         
           Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder.
           It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.

           Well, Richard: thank you for

           party. The conversation has been
           riveting, like stepping back in 
           time. Before I go, a toast.

           No, Cal. We can't just go to the

           In Hell, every store is the Gap,
           that's what's wrong with the Gap,
           Cal. It's lowest common
           denominator. Be better than the
           fucking Gap, Cal.

           You see that, Cal? The simple act

           causes Tiffany to lose interest in

           man, as a husband, and probably as

           A lot. Just to clarify. I like 
           you a lot. I had no intention of 
           falling for a married woman. I 
           just wanted someone to go to lunch 
           with who didn't make me want to 
           shoot myself in the face. But we 
           started having lunch, and talking, 
           and suddenly I was an accountant 
           who was popping out of bed in the 
           morning, excited to get to work. 
           That doesn't happen to

           She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie.
                         
                          TRACY
           Seriously?
                         
                          ROBBIE
           Sorry.
                         
           She SIGHS.

           It's been a rough couple of weeks,
           you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I
           have to get back to work.
                         
           They walk out together.

          44 INT. TRACY'S OFFICE - LATER 44
                         
           Robbie wheels around in an office chair as Tracy tries to 
           work behind her desk. He stops, noticing a PHOTO. 
                         
           It's an older picture of CAL AND TRACY. They look happy. 
           Very much in love. Tracy notices.
                         
                          TRACY
           Guess I should take it down, huh?

                          TRACY
           Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me,
           I'm almost done here.
                         
           She turns back to her work. After a beat:
                         
                          ROBBIE
           He's dressing a lot better. Going

                          TRACY
           Oh. Well, good. That's... really
           good.

           We'll get take-out for dinner

           He's sad. He looks better, but...
           sadder, too, I think. You know?
                          
                          TRACY
           Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad,

           I'm thirteen years old and... can

           Here's the thing, David: in the

           dad. He's better than you, in

           Now I know what you're thinking:
           `he's just in 8th grade, what does
           he know about love?' I know a lot
           more than you think, David. Just
           today, I had a meltdown, almost
           gave up on the love of my life.
           My dad's having his meltdown now, 
           but long-term? He won't stop
           fighting for my mom any more than
           I won't stop sending Jessica texts
           that make her uncomfortable. And
           you need to know that.

           into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the

           Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob
           in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.
                         
           Jacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in
           his new "skin" than when we left him. He's drinking a
           martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry.
                         
           A WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of
           the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool,
           practiced move... and he did it instinctively.

           Don't come back here ever.
                         
           The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around,
           uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.

           What do college guys hate? Doing 
           laundry. What do they love? 
           Strippers. It's a strip club 
           where they can do their laundry.

           It's ridiculous.

           Everyone loves the cherry. Look, 
           I'm not rejecting the psuedo- 
           cherry flavors like raspberry or 
           strawberry, anything in the -erry 
           family is allowed. But let's be 
           real here: no one wants the 
           lemon. No one likes the grape.

           "broke up" with Cal earlier) and CLAIRE, a bubbly little 
           woman -- the polar opposite of her husband. 
                          
                         
                          CLAIRE

           Leave the poor bastard alone,
           would you? I gave him the cologne 
           like you told me to. We don't 
           have to dance on his grave.

           Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become
           quite a man-about-town if you get
           my drift.

           It's kind of on the personal side
           so...

           Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the
           thing... I don't mean to be blunt
           or insulting but, let's call it
           what it is: you're always

           So my question is: how do you do
           that? I mean, how do you get them
           not to see you as... well, a kid
           in high school?

           So that helps.
                         
                          JESSICA
           Yes, I'm sure it does.
                         
                          MADISON
           You don't have a huge rack.

           Riley is my soulmate. She's the 
           one! I know it to be true, and so 
           now do the multitude.

           Multitudes?

           No, multitude.

           I have marked myself with this
           Scarlet J, Jessica! For you.
           Because your name starts with a J.
           It's just tape and construction
           paper but one day I will get a
           permanent tattoo when I'm old
           enough that my parents won't freak
           out on me.
                         
                          JESSICA
           Robbie Weaver! I am your baby-
           sitter and I'm telling you to GET
           YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW!
                         
           That does the trick. He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE.
           Jessica pulls him off to the side.

           You like the scaffold? It has
           wheels. Took four weeks to build
           it.
                          (THEN)
           Oh, those are my friends, they
           helped me wheel it down. Wave

           This has to stop, Robbie.

           for a while.
                         
           Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.
                         
                          ROBBIE
           No. You can't. I've checked. No

           parents to know.
                         
           And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the
           ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the
           cutest thing you've ever seen.

           I know. But this all has to stop
           now, Robbie. The speeches, the
           texts, all of it. It's very
           sweet, but it has to stop.
                         
           He just sits there, lost.

                          CAL
           But all it did was confirm what I
           already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!
           I LOVE YOU!!!
           Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment.
                         
                          CAL
           Before, you were the only woman
           I'd ever been with or wanted to be
           with. And now, even after I've
           been with eleven women, you're
           STILL...

           We've been here before... the same group of BORING PEOPLE
           at the same table. Liz and Hannah CHAT off to the side.
                         
           There's a cake on the table that says "CONGRATS HANNAH!"
                         
           Richard stands on a chair.

           Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!?
                         
           The room goes quiet.

           Now, if we could get our guest of

           she looks like, anyone remember? 
                         
           POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks
           at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink,
           and walks over to Richard. Is this it?
                         
                          RICHARD
           I'm so proud of you, baby. I had
           my doubts, of course...

                          RICHARD
           Now I did tell you that it'd be a
           special night when you passed the
           bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know
           I never lie...
                         
           More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders
           another drink, barely able to take it.
                         
                          RICHARD

           You don't have a better offer

           Everyone LAUGHS.

           No, that's great. I just...
           (then, privately)
           I'm sorry, I thought... I thought
           you were about to propose.
                         
           The room goes quiet, trying to hear.

           No, I just... it's fine. I'm

           Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.
                         
                          RICHARD
           Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't
           realize.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.
                          
                          RICHARD
           It's definitely a possibility,
           down the road. I think I just
           need a little more time. I'm
           still figuring out how I feel
           about us, you know: long-term.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No, I know...

           Wait -- you're figuring out how
           you feel about us?
           She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now
           watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited.

                          HANNAH
           You know what the best part is: I
           would have said yes! To YOU! And
           I didn't even want you to propose!
           Just now, I swear to God: I was
           hoping you wouldn't propose. And
           I still would have said YES!
           That's how pathetic I am!
                         
           She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT.
           She grabs Richard's cheeks.
                         
                          HANNAH
           I will consider your job offer,
           thank you so much, Richard.
                         
           Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes,
           Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.

           watch. No Cal.
                         
           Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table.
                         
           He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a
           group of nearby WOMEN.

           One of them is telling a story:
                         
                          WOMAN

           For the first time, he looks like a deer in the 
           headlights.
                         
           She grabs him. Kisses him. A long, deep, almost angry
           kiss. She pulls back.

           And then you sleep with them?
                         
                          JACOB
           Yes.
                         
                          HANNAH
           So that's what happens next? We
           sleep together?
                         
                          JACOB
           At some point, yes, I was under
           the impression that was your plan.
                         
           She takes a deep breath, admits:
                         
                          HANNAH
           I'm very nervous.
                         
                          JACOB
           I'm getting that.
                         
                          HANNAH
           I know at the bar I seemed
           confident, but I was more just
           soaking wet and cold and trying to
           be dramatic.
                         
           Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.
                         
                          JACOB
           You're adorable.
                         
           Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.
                         
                          HANNAH
           No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated
           sexy! Because I know what happens
           next in the PG-13 version of
           tonight: I get really drunk, and
           I pass out, and you cover me with
           a blanket, and kiss my forehead,
           and nothing happens... but that's
           not why I'm here!
                          (THEN)
           I'm here to bang the hot guy from
           the bar who hit on me.

           I do. We're going to bang. I'm
           finally going to do something
           exciting and dangerous and Liz can
           blow me!
                         
           Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Okay, okay, this is happening.
                          (THEN)
           Take off your shirt.

                          HANNAH
           I need to stop thinking. Take off
           your shirt.
                         
           Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it
           off. He's ripped.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Holy crap.
                         
           She pokes a finger at his abs.
                         
                          HANNAH
           It's like you're photo-shopped.
                         
                          JACOB
           Now take off yours.

           No way! Not with all that
           happening...
                         
           She motions casually at his abs.
                         
                          HANNAH
           So... do you prefer to do it here

           Meanwhile Cal, beaten up and soaking wet from the rain,
           ENTERS. He looks to his usual table, in need of a
           friend's company.
                         
           But Jacob isn't there.

           Hannah lies on her back in the dim light. Jacob is on
           top of her, shirtless. They're making out, gently.
                          
                          HANNAH
                          (TIPSY)
           This pillow is amazing. It forms
           perfectly to the shape of my head.
                         
                          JACOB
           I'm glad you like it.
                         
           They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Wait, are these those foam pillows
           from Brookstone?
                         
           Off his look...
                         
                          HANNAH
           They are, aren't they!? I always
           wondered who actually buys them!
           You do! The hot guy from the bar
           buys them! Of course!
                         
           She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.
                         
                          HANNAH
           Sorry, let's proceed.
                         
           Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again.

           Five thousand doll-- 
                         
           That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing
           with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is
           different for him. He likes her.
                         
           We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it.
           We watch him look at Hannah.

                          JACOB
           Do me a favor. Ask me a question

           He looks towards the bar, notices that same SAD SACK 
           MIDDLE-AGED GUY. Also alone. He picks up his cell.

           Tracy sits at a table, FLOWERS off to the side. Her 
           phone rings. She looks at it, sees it's "Cal." She hits 
           IGNORE. 
                         
           PULL BACK to reveal DAVID JACOBWITZ, across from her. He 
           looks at Tracy and smiles. She smiles back weakly.

           The awkward end of a first date. David walks Tracy to 
           the front door. She's carrying those same flowers. 
                         
           Awkward beat. 
                         
                          DAVID JACOBOWITZ 
           I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I 
           was wondering if -- 
                         
                          TRACY 
           David, stop. Look, I had a nice 
           time, which is a substantial 
           upgrade from the rest of the... 
           times I've been having lately. 
           So, I don't think I'm ready to 
           start dating but my ex clearly is 
           and there's a yogurt shop where 
           they make this eight calorie ice 
           cream that tastes like a laxative, 
           so if you'd like to take me there 
           sometime I guess I wouldn't say 
           no. 
                         
                          DAVID JACOBOWITZ 
           Wow. You know, that's exactly 
           what I was thinking. It's almost 
           uncanny. 
                         
           They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry. 
           Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then... 
                         
           THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.

           INSIDE THE DOOR 
                         
           Robbie sneaks down the stairs. From a kneeling position,

           Did you know your kids are the 
           only ones I baby-sit for who 
           always want to stay awake so they 
           can see their dad when he gets 
           home. I mean, they fight with 
           everything they have to keep their 
           eyes open so they can hear what 
           Dad had for dinner, or how he 
           liked the movie. Lot of kids want 
           to stay awake for Mom -- and your 
           kids always want to see you, don't 
           get me wrong -- but not a lot wait 
           up for Dad. Maybe it's because 
           he's good, and he's kind, and he's 
           decent.

           The same flowers that David Jacobowitz gave Tracy sit out 
           front. She looks at the note. It reads: "Just give me 
           a chance, love David J" but the "David J." has been 
           crossed out and replaced with "Robbie."

           windows: Robbie plays video games in his room. Molly

           Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard. He 
           fertilizes, trims and waters. All under cover of night.

           ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race 
           down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing. 
                         
           We take in the real-time TABLEAU:

           It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful. 
                         
           INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something. 
           She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS 
           her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious.

           Jacob JUMPS on Cal. David jumps on Jacob. Bernie tries
           to pull them apart.
                         
           Jessica finally gets the blindfold off Tracy. The women
           and children watch the battle in horror.

           Cal, Jacob, Bernie, and David Jacobowitz sit side-by-side
           on the miniature golf hole, bloodied but still. 
                         
           REVEAL: TWO POLICE OFFICERS standing in the center of
           the yard. One of them finishes writing in a pad. 
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER #1
           Well, okay. That should about do
           it.
           (to his partner) 
           What do you think? 
                         
           The other cop SHRUGS. The first cop, thinks, then: 
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER #1
           Look, I'm just gonna write
           domestic disturbance reported but
           all clear, okay? `Cause honestly,
           I don't even know what to put down
           here.
                         
                          TRACY
           Thank you, Officer. 
                         
           He nods, walks to the door. Stops there.
                         
                          POLICE OFFICER #1
           Just... simmer down, okay? We all
           have arguments, but if you're
           gonna fight -- just do it inside. 
           Keep it in the family, okay?
                         
           Jacob SNARFS down a laugh. Cal glares at him.
                         
                          CAL
           I'll kill you.
                         
           The cops look at Cal, at each other, SHRUG, and EXIT.

           Awkward silence. Our whole cast is there: disheveled
           and bloodied. The place looks like a hurricane has hit. 
           A miniature golf hole torn to shreds. 
                         
           Bernie turns to Jessica.

           Cal looks. Jacob still has that power over him.
                         
                          JACOB

           I have a lot of vacation days.
                         
                          JACOB
           Some vacation.

                          JACOB

           I never got it. I saw people in 
           love -- I saw weakness. I heard
           them say the things they said, and
           do the things they do, it all just
           seemed so... so pathetic.

          103 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - ONE WEEK LATER 103 
                         
           A small MIDDLE-SCHOOL AMPHITHEATER. About 150 people 
           fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation. 
                         
           Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row. Jessica 
           sits with her family a few rows away. All look nice. 
                         
           MANY ROWS BACK -- 
                         
           Sits Cal, sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS. Cal is 
           now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable. 
                         
           His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices... 
                         
           AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah. He leans 
           forward, are they saving it for him? But just then... 
           Jacob arrives. Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat. 
           Cal looks nauseous.

           Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's

           Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same 
           kid we've come to love. There's something different in 
           his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA. 
                         
                          ROBBIE
           (a bit monotone) 
           Thank you, Mrs. Thompson. 
           Welcome, Class of 2011. 
                          (A BEAT) 
           I wasn't really sure what I wanted 
           to talk about today. Mrs. 
           Thompson said it might be good to 
           talk about growing up and getting 
           older and stuff. So I guess I'll 
           talk about that. 
                         
           Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son? 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I grew up a lot this year, I 
           think. I used to think that 
           growing up meant really growing. 
           Like getting taller and bigger. 
           But now I think that growing up 
           just makes you smaller. Your 
           dreams get smaller, and what you 
           want gets smaller... 
           (beat, then) 
           I grew an inch and a half this 
           year, but I feel a lot smaller. 
                         
           Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned. 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I was in love. And I know that 
           makes parents laugh because I'm 
           only thirteen but whatever, I was.

           I believed that there was one true 
           love for everyone, and if you 
           fought for that person, your one 
           true love would always work out. 
           But that's not how it works. It 
           sounded good when I was younger, 
           but... it's just not how it works. 
           There's no such thing as one true

           crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.

           Hi, everyone. 
                         
           Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly 
           really uncomfortable. 
                         
                          CAL 
           May I have a word with my son? 
           It'll just take a second. 
                         
           Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps 
           over people, squeezes by people, almost trips. 
                         
           Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his 
           dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family. 
                         
           Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.

           with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm 
           sorry I can't give you that -- but 
           I promise you this: I will never 
           stop trying. When you find `the 
           one' you never give up trying... 
           and I love you, my amazing boy, 
           for reminding me of that. 
                         
           Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses 
           his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone. 
                         
           Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces: 
                         
                          ROBBIE 
           I still love you, Jessica! I've 
           loved you since the first time you 
           changed my sister's diaper! I've 
           loved you since... 
                         
           The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie 
           continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back. 
                         
          104 EXT. GRADUATION CEREMONY - LATER 104 
           The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family. 
           They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob.

           I already ordered a gun. I'm not 
           kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on 
           a shady internet site, I can show 
           you the receipt. If you hurt her, 
           I am prepared to shoot you in the

           Hannah took me to the Gap. It's 
           actually not as bad as I thought.

           Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap. 
           I got this at Nordstrom's.

           Strained. I took a summer
           internship up at Stanford, gonna 
           head up there early. Figure it
           can't hurt to get out of his line
           of sight for a while.
                         
                          ROBBIE
           Yeah, probably a good idea.
                          (THEN)
           You were a good baby-sitter,
           Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you
           uncomfortable.
                         
           He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.
                         
                          JESSICA
           Wait: I thought you weren't

                          ROBBIE
           I'm not. But I figure: you like 
           my dad, and one day I'll look like
           my dad, so I'll just come for you
           then.
                         
           Jessica smiles.

           It's a good plan.
                         
           She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.

           Until then: a little graduation
           gift. To help get you through
           high school.
                         
           She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of
           envelope she once used for...
                         
           Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses
           him, sweetly, on the cheek.
                         
                          JESSICA
           You take care, Robbie.
                         
           Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps

           I've been in such a strange place. 
           And we have all these problems, so 
           many problems I've lost count, but

           only thing I know --

          A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the
          moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES

          Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to
          know them as The Croods.

           With every sun comes a new day. A new
           beginning. A hope that things will be
           better today than they were yesterday.
                         
          The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for
          food. Scared. Fast.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They
          escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

           But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is
           my family, the Croods. If you weren't
           clued in already by the animal skins and
           sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most
           days we spend in our cave, in the dark.
           Night after night, day after day. Yep.
           Home sweet home. When we did go out, we
           struggled to find food in a harsh and
           hostile world. And I struggled to
           survive my family.
                         
          The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They

           We were the last ones around. There used
           to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a
           mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand
           snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs,
           common cold. And, the Croods. That's
           us. The Croods made it...
                         
          Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.

           Because of my Dad. He was strong... and
           he followed the rules.
                         
          A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his
          family home.

          2.
                         
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           ... the ones painted on the cave walls.
           Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad,
           going out at night is bad. Basically,
           anything fun is bad. Welcome to my
           world.
                         
          They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock
          door closed.
                         
          SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this
          time the light casts an ominous tone.
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           But this is a story about how all that
           changed in an instant.
                         
          RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.
          HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.
                         
          SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...
                         
                          EEP (V.O.)
           Because what we didn't know, was that our
           world was about to come to an end. And
           there were no rules on our cave walls to
           prepare us for that.
                         
          CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A

          SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS
          A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming,
          growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT
          DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He
          LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.
                         
                          GRUG
           Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF
           Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!
                         
          As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits
          for the echoes of his outburst to fade.
                         
          Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a
          signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--
                         
          A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.
          3.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           You're supposed to wait for my signal
           Eep. Eep?
                         
          Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on
          Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on
          an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN.
                         
                          EEP
           We've been in that cave forever.
                         
                          GRUG
           Three days is not forever.
                         
                          EEP
           It is with this family.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep would you come down here? You're
           being so dramatic.
                         
          A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next. Her display is
          more terrier-like.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           No, no, no Sandy, come back here.
           Remember the signal. Good girls wait for
           the signal.
                         
          A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next. She is mostly
          focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to
          her display.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ugga.
                          UGGA
           As soon as I get Sandy, I'll go back in,
           and you can give the signal.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, I mean, you're already out now.
                         
           THUNK (O.S.)
           I am waiting for the signal, dad.
                         
          We HEAR the voice of Grug's nine-year-old son from inside
          the cave. THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates
          his every move.
                         
                          GRUG
           Never mind, Thunk. Just, come out.
          4.
                         
                         
                          THUNK
           (not so fast)
           Uhh, but if you don't give the signal,
           how do I know you're my dad?
                         
                          GRUG
           The signal isn't so you know it's me,
           it's so you know I wasn't eaten by an
           animal.
                         
          Beat.
                         
                          THUNK
           Then why is the signal an animal noise?
           I mean, doesn't that just confuse things?
                         
          Grug sighs.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           I don't know... I'm still waiting for the
           signal.
                         
                          GRUG
           Sigh. Hoo hooooo! Hoo hooooo!
                         
          Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug. Thunk
          picks up a boulder and throws it. It ricochets off the
          cliff wall and careens into Grug. Grug gets plowed over
          by the boulder.
                         
                          UGGA
           Mom, we're ready to leave.
                          (BEAT)
           Mom!
                         
          Grug sits up and smiles.
                          GRAN
           Still alive!
                         
          Grug's face drops.
                         
                          GRUG
           It's still early.
                         
                          GRAN
           And you're still fat.
                         
                          GRUG
           Breakfast formation!
                         
          The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the
          lead.
          5.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           I want to see some real caveman action
           out there. We do this fast. We do this
           loud, we do this as a family and never
           not be afraid. Go!
                         
                          THUNK
           YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!
                         
          COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon,
          across the wide expanses of desert.

          EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING
                         
          Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING
          GROUNDS. They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.
                         
                          THUNK
                          (HUFFING)
           Yeah... breakfast...
                         
          We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. The Croods
          take shelter behind a rock. Grug PEERS over the top.
                         
                          GRUG
           Who's up?
                         
          Eep's hand SHOOTS up. Thunk is less than enthusiastic.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           We'll flip for it.
                         
          Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Call her in the air.
                         
                          EEP
           Heads.
                         
          Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her
          tail is showing.
                         
                          GRUG

          The family fades back and splits up. They get into
          fighting/running position.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk.
                         
          Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES
          the egg.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave!
                         
          Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.
                         
          A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Oooh!
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Release the baby.
                         
          Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its
          heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the
          egg from its beak.
                         
          Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their
          shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting
          cable on a carrier.
                         
          Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP
          their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES
          DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip
          Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.
                         
                          UGGA
           Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods!
                         
          Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail
          and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.
                         
                         ON GRAN
                         
          DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey
          player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM
          in behind her.
                         
          The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE
          GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST.
                         
                          GRAN
           Old lady down! Eep, avenge me.
          7.
                         
                         
                         ON EEP
                         
          Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on
          the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep
          LAUNCHES.
                         
          Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off
          in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg
          into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.
                         
                          EEP
           Thanks!
                         
          A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She
          loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep!
                         
                          EEP
           Heads Up!
                         
          Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small
          cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips
          over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the
          ground and fumbling the egg once again.
                         
          Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down
          on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.
          The family members meet up as they begin their long run
          back to the cave.
                         
          An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head
          back to their cave.
                         
          The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the
          chase.
                         
          Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each
          family member onto the Girelephant's back.
                         
          Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a
          launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.
                         
          Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.
                         
                          THUNK
           Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?
                         
                          GRUG
           Just wait till we get home. Eep put on
           the brakes.
                         
          The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.
          8.
                         
                         
          Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes
          over the other. Together they dig their heels into the
          ground, slowing down the Girelephant.
                         
          The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the
          Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Eep!
                         
          The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the
          crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the
          canyon, sending the Croods flying in. They all tumble.
          Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds
          tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up
          the egg.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Who's hungry?
                         
                          THUNK
           Alright! Good one, dad!
                         
                          GRUG
           Here you go, Thunk. Drink up.
                         
          Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it
          cracks open.
                         
                          THUNK
           Sorry, dad.
                         
                          UGGA
           Looks like fast food tonight!
                         
          The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each
          Crood gets a taste. Thunk is the last Crood to get a
          mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.
                         
                          GRUG
           That's alright. I ate last week.
                         
          A SHADOW TOUCHES Grug's feet. He looks up - the sun is
          setting behind the canyon wall. He HOLDS UP his hand to
          gauge how much daylight is left.

          Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears
          a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb
          even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)

           Come on.
                         
          Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It
          SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug
          sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.

          Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature,
          allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug
          barely gets the cave closed in time.

          A pebble hits Grug in the head. It came from Eep's

          Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays
          put.
          As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall
          of the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           A long time ago, this little bear was
           alive. She was alive because she
           listened to her father and lived her life
           in routine and darkness and terror. So
           she was happy. But Krispy had one,
           terrible problem. She was filled with...
           curiosity.

                          GRUG
           Yes. And one day, while she was in a
           tree, the curious little bear wanted to
           climb to the top.
                         
                          THUNK

                          GRUG
           And no sooner than she climbed to the
           top, she saw something new and died.
                         
          Grug SWATS the painting.
                         
                          THUNK

           Yes! Her last moments of terror still
           frozen on her face.
                         
          Grug holds out Krispy Bear. The family is terrified.

          All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into
          one big heap, warm and comfy. Grug casts a glance to
          Eep's ledge. She doesn't budge.

          INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT
                         
          The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep,
          who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the
          ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.
                         
          But then, SILENCE.
                         
          And then cutting through the primordial night is a
          MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps
          around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the
          "door" to peer outside, when suddenly--
                         
          WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around
          the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW.
          She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to
          catch it in her hands.
                         
          Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to
          get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more
          than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the
          disappearing light.
                         
          Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the
          cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she
          shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes
          all of her strength, but she manages to move it just
          enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.
                         
          EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her
          heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face
          and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is
          exhilarating.
          The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it
          will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her
          hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels
          herself.
                         
          Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING
          through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to
          side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon,
          we...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CANYON
                         
          The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on
          it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick
          underfoot.
          16.
                         
                         
          It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES.
                         
          A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall
          above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow.
                         
          She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected
          speed.
                         
          The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and...
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS
                         
                         
          EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT
                         
          Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is
          a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was
          following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.
                         
          REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on
          the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING.
                         
          But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her,
          something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and
          creeps up behind her.
                         
          Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away
          from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at
          her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her
          face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs
          the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.
          It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps
          back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash
          the Creature's brains in.
                         
                          CREATURE
           Nuh! Nuh!
                         
          The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front
          of its face.
                         
                          GUY
           No!
                         
          Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to
          this monstrosity.
                         
          The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his
          grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's
          BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY.
          17.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Augh!
                         
          Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's
          foot.
                         
                          GUY
           AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH!
                         
                          EEP
           Shhh!
                         
          Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and
          TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels
          around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the
          head.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Ow!
                         
                          GUY
                          (GASPING)
           Air.
                         
                          EEP
           ...You talk.
                         
                          GUY
           I'm a person, like you.
                         
          Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Sort of... like you.
                         
          Eep OPENS Guy's mouth and pokes around inside. She
          SNIFFS at him. Turns him upside-down.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that
           tickles. Hey!
                         
          Eep looks closely at BELT, a sloth wrapped around Guy's
          waist. Belt's eyes OPEN.
                         
                          EEP
           Augh!
                         
          Eep DROPS Guy on his head.
                         
                          GUY
           OW! Wow. --
                         
          Eep jams her foot over Guy's mouth.
          18.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Quiet! I'm not supposed to be out here.
                         
          Guy BITES her foot.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           OW!
                         
          She KICKS Guy in the stomach. He ROLLS sideways. Guy is
          getting the worst of this encounter. Eep kicks Guy off-
          frame. We HEAR the fight continuing.

          Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening.
          He pushes the "sleep pile" off of him. Checks Eep's
          ledge... but she is gone.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (TO UGGA)

                          GRUG
           Stay in the cave!
                         
          Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave. Peering
          into utter darkness. He steels himself... and then
          releases his hand from the "door."

          Guy is still on his knees.
                         
                          GUY
           (in pain, defeated)
           Wow. You're really strong.
                         
          The flame DWINDLES. Guy MOVES toward it. Eep BLOCKS
          him.
                         
                          EEP

          No way Guy is getting past her.
                         
                          GUY
           It's dying. I can fix it!
                         
          Eep doesn't want to.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Please. I hate the dark.
                         
          Eep sees a kindred spirit. She gets out of his way. Guy
          PICKS UP the torch and BLOWS. Eep scoots closer to Guy,
          staying in the circle of light around him. As Guy brings
          the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar
          to Eep. This boy seems to have power over light itself.
          Eep is smitten.

          Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.

           You do this a lot.
                         
          Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken.

          Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on
          Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS
          upright.

          Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.

           What are "pants up?"
                         
                          GUY
           Who are you?
                         
                          EEP
           Eep.
                         
                          GUY
           (cutting her off)
           Let me clarify, Eep. The world is
           ending.
                         
                          EEP
           What?
                         
                          GUY
           I'm calling it...
                          (VERY DRAMATIC)
           The... End.
                         
                          BELT
           Da da daaaaa.
                         
                          EEP
           How do you know?
                         
          Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da
          daaaa. It seems very important to them.
                         
                          GUY
           I've seen it. It's coming this way.
           First, the Earth is going to shake. Then
           it breaks open. Everything falls in.
           Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too
           dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me,
           everything we're standing on, all this
           right here, will be gone.
                         
          Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           We've got to get to high ground. I know a
           mountain, that way--
                         
          He points into the distance.
          22.
                         
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           It's our only chance.
           (extending his hand)
           Come with me.
                         
          Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep.
                         
                          EEP
           I can't.
                         
          Guy hands the shell to Eep. And Eep is mesmerized. Guy
          pulls his hog-mask back down.
                         
                          GUY
           Okay. Here. If you survive, call me.
                         
          Eep test-blows the shell. It makes a sound, she giggles.
          When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.
                         
                          EEP
           Thank you. Hello? Hey!
                         
          Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Dad!
                         
                          GRUG
           Are you hurt? What took you?
                         
                          EEP
           Nothing. I left on my own.
                         
                          GRUG
           You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!?
                          EEP
           Dad, let me explain...
                         
          A low GROWL interrupts them.
                         
          ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around. It passes over a log.
                         
          CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one
          hand, Eep dangling in the other.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERED)
           You never let me talk.
                         
                          GRUG
           You're grounded.

          EXT. CANYON - OUTSIDE THE KEYHOLE - MORNING
                         
          Grug and Eep move up the canyon. Eep furiously kicks a
          rock, it nearly hits Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hey!
                         
          Things are tense between the two. At the KEYHOLE, they
          are met by the rest of the Croods.
                         
                          UGGA
           Eep!
                         
                          EEP
           Mom!
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug! What happened!?
                         
                          GRUG
           You know what, I am so mad right now,
           that I can't talk to her.
                         
                          UGGA
           Eep?
                         
                          EEP
           You'll never believe it. I found
           something new.
                         
                          CROODS
           New?!!!!
          The Croods all SNATCH up stones. They form a defensive
          circle.
                         
                          GRUG
           New's a big problem!
                         
          Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation.
          She SQUEEZES out.
                         
                          EEP
           Wait. Wait!
                         
                          UGGA
           Eep. Stay inside the family kill circle.
                         
                          EEP
           It wasn't bad.
          24.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           New is always bad.
                         
                          EEP
           No. He was nice.
                         
                          GRUG
           What!? Excuse me? He?
                         
                          EEP
           Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog,
           but then he turned into a boy.
                         
                          GRAN
           Strange. Usually it's the reverse.
                         
          Grug RAISES an eyebrow.
                         
                          THUNK
           Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy
           hog!
                         
          Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.
                         
                          EEP
           There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna
           call him.
                         
          Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the
          sound ALARMS the Croods.
                         
          They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with
          their rocks.
                         
          Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods
          are satisfied the object is gone.
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           What is wrong with you?
                         
                          GRUG
           It was dangerous.
                         
                          EEP
                          (VERY ANGRY)
           It was beautiful. You want to see
           dangerous? Here.
                         
          She pelts Thunk with a rock.
                         
                          THUNK
           Owww! My sniffer!
          25.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to
           the cave and you're going to stay in
           there until you're older than... her!
                         
                          EEP
           What!? You can't keep me inside forever!
                         
          Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a
          rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust.
                         
          CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground.
          Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack
          starts to splinter under their feet.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           He said this would happen.
                         
          Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE!
                         
                          GRUG
           Get to the cave! GO!
                         
          The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting
          their way through falling boulders and shifting ground,
          heading towards the safety of their cave.
                         
          The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above
          their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling
          rock will crush the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Look out! Stop!
                         
          Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from
          the mass of rocks crashing down.
          The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is
          destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth
          settles.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
          SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER
                         
          The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball,
          covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered
          and safe under his mighty arms.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Is everyone okay?
                         
                          UGGA
           Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone.
          26.
                         
                         
          Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone.
                         
                          GRUG
           No.
                         
          Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might
          still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two.
                         
          He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he
          lowers his head.
                         
          As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through
          the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--
                         
          As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.
                         
                          EEP
           You really need to see this...
                         
          The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful
          world.
                         
          The Croods look out at the new world.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           We should go there!
                         
                          GRUG
           No. No one is going anywhere.
                         
          Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           What else did that boy say?
                         
          WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant
          flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE.
                         
          The Croods reel back as it sails overhead. They turn to
          watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away.
                         
          They hear a familiar menacing growl. It's the BEAR OWL!
                         
          It roars and charges toward the Croods.
                         
          Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in
          front of his family.
                         
          The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like
          a ball of yarn.
                         
          But the Croods are not behind it. They are running
          towards the New World.
          27.
                         
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug?
                         
                          GRUG
           Just go! Go! Go!
                         
          The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl
          closing in.
                         
          They reach the edge. The Bear Owl dives.
                         
          The Croods LEAP. They hang for a moment and begin
          tumbling down a steep jungle hill.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD
                         
          EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY
                         
          The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots
          and strange plants and land in a heap. They all lie on
          their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm.
                         
          Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff
          above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their
          lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to
          tumble down. There is no sign of the BEAR OWL.
                         
          The others stand up, and they take in this new place.
                         
          Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:
                         
                          GRUG
           One, two, three, four, five --
          BEAT. Grug smiles.
                         
          Gran lands in a heap behind him.

           Oh... Where are we?
                         
                          GRUG
           I don't know, I'm not sure. Down. In a
           lower place. One thing's for sure, we
           can't go back the way we came.
          28.
                         
                         
          The Croods SIT UP. They are disoriented.
                         
                         ON SANDY

           (hushed, urgent)
           Sandy? What is it?
                         
          Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a
          bush.
                         
          Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back
          like a dog on a leash.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, no! Come back, Sandy!
                         
          Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from
          Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the
          bush and scurry away.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
                          (TENSE WHISPER)
           We can't be out in the open like this.
           We need a cave. Now step where I step.
                         
          They start moving.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
                          (WHISPERS)
           Okay. Stay quiet. Hopefully nothing big
           knows we're here yet.
          PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE
          senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF.
                         
          ON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay.
                         
          The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the
          middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest.
                         
                          THUNK
                          (RAMBLING)
           So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking
           for the exact same cave?
                          (MORE)
          29.
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           If it was me, I'm just throwing this out
           there, if it was me choosing the cave, I
           would go with a smaller cave.
                         
          As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH
          MONKEYS) watch these foreigners.
                         
          In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in
          the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through
          a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the
          "pears" all turn to watch the Croods.
                         
          A leaf FLUTTERS down.
                         
                          GRUG
           Wait.
                         
          Eep and Grug LOOK UP.
                         
          WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH
          MONKEYS.

                          GRUG
           I'll take care of this.
                         
          Grug launches into his Threat Display -
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!
                         
          He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the
          nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey.
          Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a
          BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in
          the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into
          another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits
          Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! -
                         
                          THUNK
           Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you
           got em-- Now they're really hitting you.
           Dad I got it, just stop running into
           their fists.
                         
          Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.
                         
                          GRAN
           Hah, I'm loving this.

                          UGGA
           Grug, when you're done, we should get
           going.
                         
          Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a
          pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch
          Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun!
          The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away
          for no apparent reason.
                         
          Grug staggers backwards into the family.
                         
                          GRUG
           That's right! You can't get past this!
                         
                          CHUNKY

          A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a
          MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified
                         
          Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the
          rock and SPRINGS! -
                         
                          CROODS

           Climb! Climb! Climb!
                         
          Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as
          it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal.
                         
          GRUG'S POV: A cave!
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           CAVE! GO! GO!
                         
          The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to
          the cave.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Come on! Hurry up, let's go! Come on!
                         
          The Croods all RUN LIKE CRAZY in the direction Grug
          pointed. They step inside the "cave." SLAM! The front
          of the cave comes down. The Croods have jumped inside
          the MOUTH of a LAND WHALE!
          31.

          The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out
          through its blow hole. The Croods land in a heap.
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay, that's one, two, three, four,

           Grrrrrrrrr.
                         
          The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass.
          It looks at the Croods with delight. Suddenly, the
          shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore.
          It freaks out and retreats into the forest.
                         
                          THUNK
           Hah! It's scared of the dark... wait...
           we're scared of the dark.
                         
          And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the
          setting sun falls across the Croods.
                         
          Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the
          grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating
          cloud above them. It's a beautiful sight.
                         
          The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND
          WHALE.
                         
          Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is
          SKELETONIZED. It CRUMPLES to the ground.
                         
                          GRUG
           Kill circle!
                         
          The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing
          rocks.
                         
          Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand. She SPRINTS for it.
          32.

           Eep! Eeeep!
                         
          Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and
          long.
                         
          ON GUY hearing the horn. He is happy to hear the sound,
          knowing it's Eep calling him.
                         
          Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices
          the circling birds in the sky. Alarmed, he DASHES off.
                         
          Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone
          in the clearing. He sees the birds heading towards her.
          He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right
          over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK.
                         
          Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out
          of Eep's hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with
          two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the
          remaining light. All goes BLACK.
                         
          Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy.
          He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES
          UP! The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds
          like a knife. For a few moments the Croods are inside a
          TORNADO of the tiny monsters. The mass PASSES.
                         
          Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past.
                         
          Grug TURNS to see Guy, HOLDING his daughter. Grug's
          expression DARKENS. He SNARLS.

          Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.
                         
                          GRUG

          Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods. They
          are in defensive ape-like positions. Each doing their
          threat display.
          33.

           got a tail...
                         
                          EEP
           Uhhh... yeah...
                         
          Guy PULLS his knife.
                          GUY
           Close your eyes. I'm going to have to
           take their lives.
                         
                          EEP
           (slapping the knife away)
           No. It won't help.
                          (EMBARRASSED)
           They're my family.
                         
                          GUY
           What?
                         
          Eep nods toward Thunk.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ah, the sun is in his hands!
          34.
                         
                         
          The Croods keep circling.
                         
                          EEP
           No. No. It's "fire."
                         
                          UGGA
           Where did it come from?
                         
                          EEP
                          (PROUDLY)
           He made it.
                         
          Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight.
                         
                          GRUG
           Make some for me!
                         
                          EEP
           It doesn't come out of him.
                         
                          GRUG
           Make. Make it.
                         
          POP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time.
                         
                          GUY
           You know, you're a lot like your
           daughter.
                         
          Guy falls in a heap.
                         
                          EEP
           Great, now he's broken.
                         
           UGGA (O.S.)
           Oh, it's a baby sun.
          Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now
          sitting very close around the fire, transfixed.
                         
                          GRUG
           Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it
           wants.
                         
          As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting
          Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he
          talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the
           sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll
           find a new cave, and pretend today never
           happened.
                          (MORE)
          35.
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           (looks at the fire)
           Isn't this fun, Eep?
                         
          Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows
           where he's been.
                         
          Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She
          shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE.
                         
                          THUNK
           Dad, Sandy's hurting fire.
                         
          Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this
          point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she
          struggles, kicks and bites.)
                         
                          GRUG
           Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!
                         
                          UGGA
           Aww, what a cute little guy.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hey, stay back.
                         
          The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air
          around them.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           No, no, no, wait!
                         
          One of the embers has caught onto Thunk's tunic.
                          THUNK
           It likes me!
           (after a beat)
           Hey! IT'S BITING ME!!
                         
          Thunk takes off running like a maniac.
                         
          The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires
          in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires
          with utter confusion.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
                          (SCREAMING)
           Ow! You're not my friend. Stop, stop
           touching me!
          36.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Thunk! Uh, try hiding from it in the
           tall dry grass!
                         
          Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring
          of fire blazes up.
                         
                          THUNK
           (pleading with fire)
           Stop please, please. I'm only nine.
                         
          Gran cackles at her grandson's misfortune, but then she
          realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE.
                         
          Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick
          on the ground, trying to put it out.
                         
          But she only ends up making more small fires.
                         
                          UGGA
           Ooh, more fire babies.
                         
          While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga
          starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to
          grow in size.

           Hi.
                         
                          GUY
           So, your Dad, he's trying to kill me.
                          EEP
           Yeah. But I won't let him.
                         
                          CUT TO:
                         
          Eep and Guy witness the FIERY MAYHEM:
                         
           GRUG (O.S.)
           Hold on son, come back!
                         
          SERIES OF SHOTS:
                         
           GRUG is chasing THUNK in circles, throwing rocks at his
          flaming butt.
                         
                          THUNK
           I don't like you anymore!
          37.
                         
                         
           Sandy, who is still in Grug's arms, but facing
          backwards, is now holding onto a burning stick and
          lighting everything she passes on fire.
                         
                          SANDY
           Weeeee!!!!
                         
           Gran, who is still trying to put out her stick, is
          batting it into every tree and bush she can hit.
                         
                          GRAN
           Get out! Out!
                         
           Ugga carries a REDWOOD above her head and then tosses
          it onto the small fire.
                         
                          UGGA
           Eat up, babies!
                         
          WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire.
                         
          The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic
          pyromaniacs.
                         
          CLOSE ON GRAN
                         
          Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground.
                         
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a
          giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.
                         
                          GRAN
           Die! Die!
                         
          POOF! The fire on her cane has finally gone out.
                          GRAN (CONT'D)
           I win!
                         
          She smiles. And then WA-POP!
                         
          The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame
          who slams into Thunk. The speeding ear picks up Ugga,
          Grug.
                         
          ON EEP AND GUY
                         
                          EEP
           They're not so scary once you get to know
           them.
                         
          Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn.
          38.
                         
                         
                          GUY
           Who are you people?
                         
                          UGGA
           Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods!
           And you are?
                         
                          GUY
           Uh, Guy.
                         
                          CROODS
                          (WAVING)
           Hi, Guy.
                         
          The speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy
          and the Croods sprawling across the tundra. The flying
          ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks.
                         
                          THUNK
           Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like
           food.
                         
          Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are
          BURIED.
                         
                          GRUG
           Don't eat it, it's new.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 1425 - THE GOAL IS SET
                         
          The Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn.
                         
                          CROODS
           Still alive!
                         
          ON THE BASE OF THE POPCORN PILE
                         
           GUY (0.S.)
           Come on, keep eating.

           Squirf!
                         
                         
          Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a
          prisoner escaping Alcatraz.
                         
                          GUY
           gasping for air 
           (checks to see if he's been
                          SPOTTED)
          39.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Hey, where's Guy?
                         
          Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a
          tiger.
                         
                          GUY
           No!
                         
                          EEP
           Going somewhere?
                         
                          GUY
           The mountain? High ground? End of the
           world, remember?
                         
                          EEP
           That already happened. It destroyed our
           cave.
                         
                          GUY
                          (STRUGGLING)
           Noooo. That was just the beginning of the
           end. The end of the end is still coming.
                         
                          GRUG
           (as if to a dog)
           Eep. Drop it.
                         
          Eep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't
          let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's
          been tied to a piling.
                         
                          EEP
           We can't let him go! What if we don't
           find a cave before sunset? What if it
           takes a few days? What if the birds come
           back?
                         
          BEAT.
                         
                          GRAN

          46.
                         
                         
          Thunk CRASHES THROUGH the bushes, PURSUED by the Turkey
          Fish. Grug is being DRUG behind.
                         
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hang on Thunk, I'm coming!
                         
                          THUNK
           Why are you doing this?
                         
                          GUY
           What are they doing?
                         
                          UGGA
           Hunting.
                         
                          THUNK
           Get it off! You stay away from me.
                         
                          GUY
           No seriously, what are they doing?
                         
          The Turkeyfish squashes Grug into the ground. Then
          continues chasing Thunk.
                         
                          THUNK
           (to Turkey Fish)
           You've got a ton of eggs. Just make
           another egg!
                         
          Thunk FLIES INTO FRAME and SPLATS against the rock. The
          Turkey Fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives
          off.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           Now you're just rubbing it in.
          ON A GIANT BRONTO SCORPION
                         
          SLAPPED on a rock in front of the Croods.
                         
          The Bronto Scorpion suddenly STRUGGLES.
                         
                          GRUG
           There! Who's hungry for scorpion?
                         
          The Croods PULL at the legs. They TWIST and SNAP OFF
          like lobster legs.
                         
                          GUY
           What happened to the egg and the bird?
          47.
                         
                         
                          THUNK
                          (STILL PUNCHY)
           You know, we lost him. But when the bird
           stepped on me and pushed me into the
           ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me
           and one thing led to another and here we
           are eating him. Win win.
                         
          The dismembered legs continue to STRUGGLE. Guy looks
          ill.
                         
                          GRAN
           Not enough. Not enough. I need more. I
           need more!
                         
          Gran looks hungrily at Guy.
                         
                          GUY
                          (CONCERNED)
           Oh, look at that. She's not gonna eat me
           right?
                         
                          UGGA
           You're too skinny. If she was gonna eat
           anyone it would be--
                         
                          THUNK
           AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH!
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           Owww! She's locked her jaw!
                         
                          UGGA
           Mom!
                         
          Sandy gets up from the table.
                          THUNK
           Someone get a stick! Get her off!
                         
          Guy looks on, horrified.
                         
                          THUNK (CONT'D)
           Oh you sick old monster! Hurry! Put the
           stick in her mouth!
                         
          Belt gives Guy a "let's get out of here" look. Belt rolls
          Guy away from the family.
                         
                          GRUG
           Hold her still. Use a rock. Ugga would
           you just hit her legs.
                         
          Guy LEAVES. Eep chases him and pins him down.
          48.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Why are you rolling away?
                         
                          GUY
           Owww! I just want something to eat.
                         
                          EEP
           You have bug for dinner. Plenty of bug!
                         
                          GUY
           Please... I'll let you help me hunt.
                         
                          EEP
           Really?
                         
                          THUNK
           Ahhh! They're all over me... Tell my
           story...
                         
                         
          EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON
                         
          Guy lays a snare in the low grass. He WALKS to the base
          of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes.
          He TIES the rope around the base of the tree. Then he
          hands the loose end to Eep. Belt stretches his arms
          WIDE. Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the
          tree.
                         
          Eep takes the cue. She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning
          top of the tree. Her weight gently BENDS the tree top
          down to the ground.
                         
                          GUY
           Okay.
          Guy carefully SETS the trigger.
                         
                          EEP
           What do you call this?
                         
                          GUY
           A trap.
                         
                          EEP
           What does it do?
                         
          Guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he
          describes the trap.
          49.
                         
                         
                          GUY

           soft whistle Raargh, Thump thump thump,
           thubububububub soft whistle poom!
           Tadaaaaaa!
                         
                          EEP
           How long have you been alone?
                         
          Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a
          long, long time.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           ... So what do we do?
                         
          Guy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET.
                         
                          GUY
           How's your acting?
                         
          ON THE TURKEY FISH getting ready to eat the TRIP-GERBILS.
          The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it,
          but he's INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound. He TURNS to
          see the silly little puppet dancing about. The Turkey
          Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet.
                         
          ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet. Eep is having the
          time of her life.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Oh, you're good at this.
                         
          They are so into what they are doing, they accidentally
          get TANGLED UP.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Oh, sorry, I...
                         
                          EEP
           Just move your arm... no, your other arm.
           Oh, that one's mine.
                         
          In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy
          inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish. It CHARGES. Eep
          and Guy don't notice.
                         
          The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and
          SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guy's head, THRASHING it.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Uh... It didn't step in your trap-y,
           thing.
          50.
                         
                         
                          GUY
           Yeah, I noticed.
                         
          Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird. The Turkey Fish
          grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field. He
          goes flying through the air, screaming.
                         
          ON GRUG - hearing the commotion. Guy lands back in the
          log.
                         
                          GRUG
           Where's Eep?
                         
          Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.
                         
                          GUY
           She's awesome.
                         
          Grug STEPS FORWARD. He's going to SPRING the trap.
                         
                          GRUG
           Eep!
                         
                          EEP
           Dad, no!
                         
          She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN.
                         
          The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger. The snare TRIPS. The
          bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short. The
          Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air. He FLIES a
          couple hundred feet up...
                         
          ... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.

          EXT. BARBECUE
                         
          ON THE TURKEY ROASTING over an open fire. It looks golden
          and juicy. Grug is agitated. The Croods are devouring
          the Turkey Fish.
                         
                          THUNK
           It's an avalanche of flavor.
                         
          THE CROODS are eating like wild animals. They
          practically MAUL each other for scraps. HOWLS and
          SNARLING fill the night air. Guy is amazed and shocked
          at how the Croods are wolfing it down.
          51.
                         
                         
          Guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock.
          Guy and Belt share a concerned LOOK as they politely eat
          their meal. Eep comes over and sits next to Guy.
                         
                          GUY
                          (TO BELT)
           Looks like we won't be having any
           leftovers.

           What are "left-overs?"

                          (CONFUSED)
           You know, when you have so much food to
           eat you have some, left over.
                         
                          EEP
           We never have that much food.
                         
          Grug is struck by Eep's words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt.
          Guy and Belt are struck by this as well.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug, how about a story?
                         
                          GRUG
           That's a good idea. How about a story
           huh?
                         
                          THUNK
           Yeah a story, tell us a story!
                         
          Croods gather around Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Once upon a time there was a little tiger
           who lived in a cave with her family.
           There were a lot of rules, but the big,
           simple one was to never leave the cave at
           night. And the door was so heavy, you'd
           think it would be easy to remember.
                         
                          THUNK
           So easy to remember!
                         
                          GRUG
           I know! But, while everyone was asleep,
           she went out anyway.
                         
                          CROODS
           No!
          52.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes! And no sooner than she did, her
           cave was destroyed and everyone had to go
           on this long, sucky walk, with some
           weirdo they met, and died! The end.
                         
                          GUY
           Whoa! I did not see that coming. Twist
           ending. My stories never end like that.
                         
                          THUNK
           Yes! Two stories in one night!
                         
          The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy. Guy is
          uncharacteristically dumbstruck.
                         
          A BEAT -
                         
                          GUY
           Okay. But it won't be as good as Grug's.
           Um, once upon a time, there was a
           beautiful tiger. She lived in a cave
           with the rest of her family. Her father
           and mother told her, "You may go anywhere
           you want but never go near the cliff, for
           you could fall."
                         
                          GRUG
           And die. Good story.
                         
          Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up.
          As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.
                         
                          GUY
           But when no one was looking, she would go
           near the cliff, for the closer she came
           to the edge, the more she could hear, the
           more she could see, the more she could
           feel. Finally, she stood at the very
           edge, and she saw a light. She leaned
           out to touch it, and slipped.
                         
                          GRUG
           And she fell.
                         
                          GUY
           And she flew.
                         
                          CROODS
                          GASP 
                         
                          THUNK
           Where did she fly?
          53.
                         
                         
                          GUY
           Tomorrow.
                         
                          EEP
           Tomorrow?
                         
                          GUY
           A place with more suns in the sky than
           you can count.
                         
                          THUNK
           It would be so bright.
                         
                          GUY
           A place not like today, or yesterday, a
           place where things are better.
                         
                          GRUG
           Tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!
                         
                          GUY
           Oh yes, yes it is. I've seen it. That's
           where I'm going.
                         
          Grug studies Guy. Is he crazy? Eep though is entranced.
          Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between
          them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.
                         
                          GRUG
           Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and
           sleep. And when we wake up we're going
           to find the place that has everything we
           want.
                         
                          EEP
           Tomorrow?!
                          GRUG
           A cave.
                         
          Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log. Grug CURLS
          UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away
          from Eep.
                         
                          DISSOLVE TO:
                         
                         
          ON GRUG'S FACE.
                         
                          GRUG
           snoring, tossing and turning 
          54.
                         
                         
          Morning light kisses Grug's cheeks. He's sound asleep.
          PULL OUT to reveal that Guy's log is now teetering over a
          cliff edge - there was another subduction during the
          night, and half of the Croods' sleeping platform has sunk
          two hundred feet. Grug is still grasping Guy's log,
          which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still-
          asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end. In the nick
          of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the
          log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end. Guy
          WAKES UP, looking down.
                         
                          GUY
           AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH.
                         
           SMASH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          SEQ. 1600 - CROODS GET SHOES
                         
                         
          EXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING
                         
          The Croods trudge behind Grug as he cautiously makes his
          way to the mountain. Grug SNIFFS, and TESTS the ground -
          he moves like a man in a mine field. Meaning SLOWLY.
                         
                         
                         THE LOG
                         
          Eep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by
          Grug in the log.
                         
                          GUY
           That was too close. It almost caught us.
                         
                          GRUG
           I was watching. We were fine.
                         
                          GUY
           We've got to move faster. Do you people
           have any other speed aside from "wander?"
           I'll take a shamble at this point.
                         
                          EEP
           Hey, do you have a minute? How did the
           tiger fly?
                         
                          GUY
           I only share when I'm outside the log.
           I'm funny that way.
                         
                          EEP
                          (WINKING)
           Leave this to me.
          55.
                         
                         
          Eep FALLS BACK behind Thunk, getting him between she and
          her dad.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
           Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your
           face.
                         
          Eep SMASHES Thunk in the face, KNOCKING him into Grug,
          sending Guy and the log FLYING. Grug shoots Eep an
          annoyed look.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)
                          (SHRUGGING)
           Oops.
                         
          Grug sees Guy has ROLLED away.
                         
                          GRUG
           He's loose!
                         
          Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Aaaaahhhhhh! Do not step on those weird,
           pointy rocks!
                         
                          THUNK
           You mean these rocks? Ahh owww! Do not
           step on these rocks!
                         
          Thunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet.
                         
                          GRAN
           Step aside, girls!
                         
          Gran steps out, and then SCREAMS.
                          GRUG
           Hello? Nobody's listening! No one is
           listening. You cannot walk on those!
                         
          Guy stands on the coral without flinching.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Arraughrragh come back here now.
                         
                          GRAN
           Well, there goes our chance for survival.
                         
                          THUNK
           And our log!
                         
          Grug must make the choice to go after Guy.
          56.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay. Arraugh!
                         
          Grug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still
          locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug
          leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy
          jumps to a coral patch below.
                         
                          GUY
           Ow, ow, ow.
                         
          Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell. He
          looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the
          field and feels pity for Eep.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ow! Jumping doesn't help, I mean, just
           briefly, but it doesn't get better! Ow!
           Do not walk on your hands, the hands do
           not help at all.
                         
          Guy looks back at the stranded Croods. Then he looks
          again to the tall mountain. Belt sees that Guy is having
          a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a
          choice. Belt makes it for him.
                         
                          BELT
           Eeccoomme on!
                         
          Belt walks Guy back to the Croods
                         
           HARD CUT TO:
                         
                         
          GUY STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE CORAL, ONLY A FEW FEET FROM
          GRUG AND THE CROODS. GUY'S ARMS ARE FILLED WITH
          SUPPLIES.
                         
                          GUY
           I can help you, but we're going to have
           to make a few changes around here. The
           log ride is over. Drop the log.
                         
          Grug grudgingly DROPS the log.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Now, kick it away.
                         
          Grug BARELY NUDGES it.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Farther.
                         
          Grug KICKS it a quarter-mile.
          57.
                         
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Really?!
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay, smart, Guy... now what?
                         
          Guy SMILES.
                         
           HARD CUT TO:
                         
                         
          EXT. CORAL FIELDS - LATER
                         
          Everyone is now wearing "shoes" -- some made of leaves,
          sponges and some are actually fish!
                         
          Ugga and Gran wobble on their new shoes.
                         
          Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down.
          Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes. They
          blink at him.
                         
                          THUNK
           Ahhhh! Good fish.
                         
          Eep is covering her eyes.
                         
                          GUY
           Okay. Now you can look.
                         
          Eep peers down at her new boots.
                         
                          EEP
           Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love
           them! Where are my feet!?
                          GUY
           They're still there!
                         
                          EEP
           Oh, okay.
                         
          Eep slips, and falls into Guy's arms.
                         
                          GUY
           Whoa. You're really
                          (GETTING CRUSHED)
           ... heavy.
                         
                          EEP
           Really? Thank you!
                         
          Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground.
          58.
                         
                         
                          GRUG
           Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!!
                         
                          GUY
                          (SWEATING)
           Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're
           good...
                         
                          GRAN
           These shoes are great! Where do you get
           these ideas?
                         
                          GUY
           Ah ha.
                         
          On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk.
                         
          Guy stands Thunk against a wall. Guy stands next to him.
          Belt OUTLINES them. Guy excitedly gestures to the
          silhouettes.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure
           it's where ideas come from.
                         
                          THUNK
           Dad. I don't have a brain.
                         
                          GRUG
           We've gotten along just fine without
           brains till now. Cavemen don't need
           brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha!
           (balls his mighty fists)
           That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are
           for weaklings.
          Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Now, let's get to that mountain.
                         
          Ugga and Eep notice each other's shoes.
                         
                          UGGA/EEP
           Oh wow. I love those!
                         
                          THUNK
           Good fish. Don't eat my feet.

          SEQ. 1710 - GOING GUY'S WAY
          59.
                         
                         
          The Croods run, slowly at first, then faster. And
          faster. The shoes make the difference.
                         
          ON THE CROODS
                         
          Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again. He
          readies himself for a fight.
                         
          Guy hands out bananas.
                         
          Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it.
                         
          ON THE CROODS
                         
          Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse
          waiting for his Croods dinner.
                         
          Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks.
                         
          Traveling by stilts over a crevasse.
                         
          The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts. Guy
          helps Eep from falling.
                         
                          EEP
           So... How'd the tiger fly?
                         
                          GUY
           He jumped on the sun and rode it to
           tomorrow.
                         
           Grug doesn't like seeing his daughter so close to Guy.
                         
                          GRUG
           No, no, no!
          The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.
                         
          Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him. Grug WHACKS
          Chunky in the face with a stilt.
                         
          Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on,
          then WHACKS a chunk out of them. Grug DROPS down by a
          yard or so. Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm,
          losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunky's paw.
          Grug doesn't make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds
          emanate from the canyon.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ooowwwww!
                         
          The Croods stand at the top of a cliff.
          60.
                         
                         
          Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging
          to the side.
                         
          Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding
          down the side of the canyon past Grug.
                         
          They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by
          tiptoeing. Grug stumbles and falls down the slope.
                         
                          THUNK
           Hi dad! Bye dad!

          BOOM! A FLASH POPS against the Croods. SWING THE CAMERA
          AROUND to reveal A HUGE STORM hanging like a purple
          curtain before them. The Croods stop dead.
                         
          The rain line BEARS DOWN on them.
                         
          Grug tries to PUNCH the drops.
                         
          ON EEP AND GUY
                         
                          GUY
           You've seen rain before... right?
                         
                          EEP
           We don't get out much.
                         
          Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain.
          Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy.
                         
                          BELT
           Hmmmmm.
          Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the
          rain puddles.
                         
          Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella,
          grabs the umbrella away from Guy. Grug gets hit by
          lightning.
                         
          The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover
          as they enjoy the RAIN.
                         
          ON THE CROODS UNDULATING REFLECTION
                         
          The Croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean -
          Eep is pointing at her own reflection.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (FRUSTRATED)
           Eep, looks dangerous.
          61.
                         
                         
                          EEP
           Oh dad, you say that about everything.
                         
          Eep goes to jump in the water. Guy STOPS her.
                         
                          GUY
           Careful.
                         
                          EEP
           Oh really? Okay.
                         
          Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES.
                         
          Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows
          her how to move her arms in a swimming motion.
                         
          Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy.
          She begins to SWIM.
                         
          Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is
          building.
                         
          The Croods ALL JUMP at once.
                         
          Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving
          platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized
          swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on
          Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug!
                         
                          GRUG
           Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool.
           Not cool.
                         
          Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans.
                         
          Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to
          the bottom.
                         
          ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him
          on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant.
                         
          A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a
          sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous.
                         
          Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug
          swims for his life. Ends in a big splash.

          sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive
          MAZE.
                         
          Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods.

          Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.
                         
                          GRUG
           Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see
           why the kids need their own shells.
                         
                          GUY
           So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call

                          GRUG

                          GUY

          Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla.
                         
          Just then, A HUGE RUMBLE. The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE
          VIOLENTLY. The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the
          Maze each `falling' into a separate entrance.
                         
          They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a
          drain.
                         
          As Grug and Guy slide passed each other. Frustrated Grug,
          tries to punch Guy.
                         
                          GUY
           Oh, hello.
                         
                         
          INSIDE THE MAZE
          The SHAKING COMES TO A STOP. Everyone (now separated)
          gathers themselves.
                         
          ON GRUG-- finding himself alone.

                          GUY
           No. Too slow. Everybody, keep moving
           forward and we'll get out.

           It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna pass out.
                         
          Thunk PICKS UP his shell, and tentatively makes his way,
          alone, into his branch of the maze.
                         
          ON EEP (OR GUY?)-- in another part of the maze. She puts
          her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT.
                         
          PULL BACK and see that they are actually in parallel
          `channels' but with the huge wall between them.
          ON Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers.
                         
          ON Thunk - encountering a croco-pup.
                         
          ON Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path.
                         
          ON Grug - reaching a fork.
                         
          Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage.
                         
          Thunk THROWS his shell at the Crocopup, MISSES. To his
          surprise the Crocopup returns the shell.
                         
          Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him
          the way through the maze.

          Eep PICKS UP the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds
          a more flowers dropped on her path. She playfully begins
          hunting for Guy.
                         
          Guy and Belt are secretly and playfully tossing flowers
          in Eep's path.
                         
          Grug POPS out of a passageway - he's back where he began.
          He chooses another tunnel.
                         
          Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove -
          the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant.
                         
          Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two
          of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto
          Eep's path.
                         
                          EEP
           You dropped these.
                         
          Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at
          Eep.
                         
          They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again.
                         
          Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He
          grumbles and enters a different tunnel.
                         
          ON THE MAZE EXIT -
                         
          Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the
          setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is
          amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He
          is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep.
                         
          Guy takes her hand.
                          GUY
           Come with me.
                         
          Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and
          tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch.
                         
                          THUNK
           Here boy, catch!
                         
          A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival.
          There is an obvious change in the ladies.

          A loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two
          others.
                         
                          UGGA
           Grug?
                         
          Grug lets out another blow on his horn.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           I'll go get him.

          defeat, and TOSSES the shell down.

          from high above. Grug peers up and sees the SWINGING
          HAMMOCKS, torch lights.

          Ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the
          family.
          Grug isn't thrilled with Ugga's shot at him. He picks up
          two rocks and tries to make fire.
                         
                          GRUG

           Anyone?
                         
          Grug listens intently. All he hears is laughter.

           lives... Thank you for that.
                         
          A RUMBLE distracts Guy. He looks to the horizon. FIRES
          and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the
          collapse. Eep comes to his side.
                         
                          GUY
           I want to show you something.
                         
          Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the
          forest canopy.
                         
          Guy BLOWS OUT his torch. The night sky is revealed in
          all its glory. The Croods are amazed.
                         
          Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods.
          Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to
          sit at the very brink of the universe.

          he DUCKS back down, terrified.
                         
          He overhears the rest of the conversation.

          The constrictor SQUEEZES Grug till he turns blue. Grug
          SMACKS it and it relaxes a little.

                          GRUG
           (swings his long hair around)
           I call it a "rug." Rhymes with Grug.
           And this one. I call it a "ride."
           Rhymes with Grug.
                         
          Grug regards a boulder as if it's a Ferrari.
                         
                          GUY

                          GRUG
           It's gonna get us places faster than
           shoes.
                         
          Grug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Yeah. Try to keep up.
                         
          He LEANS FORWARD. The "car" ROLLS downhill and SMASHES
          through a redwood, TOPPLING it.
                         
                          THUNK

          Grug takes a huge flat stone and SMASHES it against
          Thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock.
                         
          Grug shows the Croods.

           Let's do it again. I think I blinked.
                         
          Thunk PASSES OUT.
                         
          ON THE CROODS

           Since I don't have a brain, they're
           coming from my stomach. Down deep below,
           and then up again into my mind.
                         
          Thunk walks into a tree. All the other Croods RAISE their
          "shades" in time to see Grug walk over a cliff.

           Isn't that something?
                         
          A huge BEAST BUNNY JUMPS into the opening of the rock.
          Grug is smashed flat.

          Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end. Grug
          is LAUNCHED into the sky. Grug becomes a speck in the
          sky. He is HIT by LIGHTNING.

          Grug falls back down onto the teeter totter dislodging
          the boulder from the other side. The boulder rolls back
          down onto Grug.

          Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky.
                         
          The shell boat hits the shore. The Croods step out onto
          land.
                         
          An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain. A PLUME of
          magma BURSTS from the water in the distance.
                         
          Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave.

          Guy and Grug do a slow-motion PLUNGE over a tar-fall. As
          they descend Grug SWINGS at Guy, coating himself with
          tar. Grug's arms are held like glue. His punches stop
          well short of Guy's face. Guy and Grug arrive in a wide
          pool of tar. They SINK slowly.

           Family. Yeah.
                         
                          GRUG
           Sorry.
                         
          Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that. Guy
          takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard.
          77.
                         
                         
                          GUY
           I was little when it happened. The last
           thing my parents told me was, "Don't
           hide. Live. Follow the Sun. You'll
           make it to Tomorrow."
                         
          This resonates with Grug.
                         
          A thread of light trickles through the storm, falling
          just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm.
                         
                          GRUG
           You followed the light. My daughter is a
           lot like you.
                         
                          GUY
           No. She's like you. She loves you but
           always forgets to say it. Just like you
           forget to tell her.
                         
          Grug ponders this. A CHANGE comes over Grug. He focuses
          on Guy. This hits Grug hard.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (CRUSHED)
           I guess I was just busy keeping them all
           alive.
                         
          Guy considers Grug.
                         
                          GUY
           It's okay. That's what Dads do.
                         
          Grug smiles. He regards Guy in a different light. He
          sees him not as a boy but a man. Someone good enough for
          his little girl.
                          GRUG
           That's right... but we can't do that from
           here. We need one of your ideas.
                         
          The music TURNS.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Come on. You can do it.
                         
          Buoyed by Grug's encouragement, Guy swings into action
          mode.
                         
                          GUY

          SEQ. 2250 - GRUG & GUY ESCAPE
                         
          We are tracking with the MACAWNIVORE. Suddenly, the big
          cat stops. His eyebrows raise.
                         
          MACAWNIVORE'S POV - a FEMALE MACAWNIVORE PUPPET.
                         
                          BELT
                          TA-DAAAAA
                         
                          GRUG
           Wow.
                         
                          GUY
           Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best
           with what he has. Let's go.
                         
          Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet.
          Belt SIGNALS to Guy.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama,
           sincerity. Move me.
                         
          Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's
          attention.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Okay he sees us!
          Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.
                         
          Grug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           That's our cue. Now work it!
                         
          The puppet starts shaking its tail.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           He's not coming over. I don't think our
           puppet looks scared enough.
                         
                          GRUG
           Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me
           those acting sticks!
          79.
                         
                         
          Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of
          terror.
                         
          Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the
          puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar,
          bringing Grug and Guy along with it.
                         
          Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame.
                         
          The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the
          tar along with Grug and Guy.
                         
                          GUY
           Hold on!
                         
          The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug
          and Guy. He is not pleased.
                         
                          BELT
           Da da daaaaaa...
                         
          The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run
          from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards
          into the nearby tar--he's stuck. The tar snaps him back
          and throws him far from Grug and Guy.
                         
          Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal!
                         
                          GRUG
           Yes. You did it!
                         
          Grug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is
          stuck to Guy's back.
                         
          The Croods come running to help them.
                          UGGA
           Grug.

           Dad!
                         
          Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug
          waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand.
                         
                          GUY
           Hey, we're okay!
                         
          The family stops to take this in.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Yeah, we're okay.
          80.
                         
                         
          The ground shakes violently. Meteors stream across the
          sky.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Grug. Your call.
                         
          Grug knows his answer.
                         
                          GRUG

          EXT. EDGE OF THE WORLD - EARLY EVENING.
                         
          ON THE CROODS
                         
          RUSHING up the gun-sight into the bright rays of the sun.
                         
                          GUY
           Hurry! Come on. We're gonna make it!
                         
          When the Croods rush toward "Tomorrow," it is a golden,
          ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun,
          clouds, and mountain. From the Croods POV it looks as if
          they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a
          waiting sun.
                         
                          EEP
           You were right.
                         
                          GUY
           There it is. The sun. We can do it! We
           can ride it to Tomorrow.
                         
          Even Grug is taken with the sight - it's there after all.
                         
          The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them.
          Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           Run!
                         
          When the rift OPENS in front of them, the hot gasses and
          blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath. The
          debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape
          beyond.
                         
          From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before
          their eyes.
          81.
                         
                         
          A SHOCKWAVE knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the
          Croods are standing on blowing them backwards.
                         
                          GUY (CONT'D)
           I don't understand. The sun was right
           here. It was right here.
                         
          KABOOM! A gargantuan jet of ash STABS at the sky. Ugga
          PULLS the Croods away from the ledge. She herds them
          back toward the gunsight.
                         
                          UGGA
           We have to go back to the cave. Hurry,
           hurry, stay together. Let's keep moving.
           Move, move! Everybody hold my hand.
           Thunk let's go. Go! Let's stay
           together.
                         
          But Grug doesn't join them. Instead, Grug takes a step
          TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as
          if trying to burn a hole straight through it.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           Grug? What's wrong with you? Grug we'll
           die if we stay here!
                         
          Grug spies a wispy shaft of light STRUGGLING through the
          ash cloud. He HOLDS UP his hand to feel it. A beam of
          light settles on his palm. Grug is ENLIGHTENED.
                         
                          UGGA (CONT'D)
           (softly to Grug)
           Grug. Listen to me. We've gotta get
           back to that cave.
                         
          Grug looks back at his family - huddled, terrified. The
          picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning.
          The sight bothers him.
                         
          Grug TURNS to face them.
                         
                          GRUG
           No more dark. No more hiding. No more

          A smile breaks across Eep's face - her dad has answered

                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           I can't change. I don't have ideas. But
           I have my strength. And right now that's
           all you need.
                         
                          UGGA
           No. We don't know what's over there.
           Maybe nothing. It's too risky.
                         
                          GRUG
           It's a chance.
                         
          Belt wipes a tear off his face.
                         
                          GUY
           I'll take that chance.
                         
          Grug LIFTS Guy above his head.
                         
                          GRUG
           You know, I've wanted to throw you away
           ever since I met you.

           Heh. That's a joke, right?
                         
                          GRUG
           What's a joke?
                         
          Grug's comment freaks Guy out. ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug
          with a twinkle in his eye.
                         
          Belt puts on his helmet for safety.
          With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void.
                         
          The Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS.

          Ugga KISSES Grug. She whispers in his ear.
                         
                          UGGA
           You did good.

           Daddy.
                         
          Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above
          his head. He HURLS her across.

           No mush, just throw me.
                         
          Grug LIFTS her above his head.
                         
                          GRAN (CONT'D)

          Grug SMILES and throws her next.

                          EEP
           No. I have too much to say to you. I
           need to fix everything and I don't have
           time.
                         
                          GRUG
           I can fix it.
                         
          Grug embraces Eep.
                         
                          EEP
           This works good. What do you call it?
                         
                          GRUG

           change it if you want.
                         
                          EEP
           No. I like a "Hug."

          Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words.

          The ground begins to shake and break apart around them.
                         
                          EEP (CONT'D)

           Never be afraid.
                         
          The gap grows wider. Grug lifts Eep and makes the
          greatest throw of his life.
                         
          The tumult parts briefly. Grug can see his entire family
          safe on the other side. He waves a last goodbye. To his
          surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open
          hand.
                         
                          GUY
           There. I see him!
                         
          The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay.

          Grug is startled by another earthquake. The ground is
          ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him.
          Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to
          crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him.

          Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them
          together, just as Guy did earlier. They ignite. Grug
          has created his very first fire.
                         
                          GRUG
                          (PLEASED)
           Hey, I did it.
                         
          Another earthquake shakes the cavern. Grug moves over to
          a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of
          his family. He paints each member individually and then
          looks longingly at the family he will never see again.
                         
          The torch begins to go out. Grug blows on it and is
          startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at
          him.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Ahhhh! Back! Stay back! Stay back!
                         
          The Macawnivore blows out the torch. Another meteor hits
          the cave with a loud boom! The Macawnivore stops growling
          and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug. It is
          just as frightened as Grug. Grug reaches out and pets
          the now gentle carnivorous beast.

          Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric
          armistice. When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of
          Eep's "shell signal." He rushes to the entrance to the
          cave. He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave
          as the world is being torn asunder.
                         
          He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES. His family
          is in trouble.
                         
                          GRUG
           They're in trouble. Hang on! I'm
           coming.
                         
          The scale of his problem sinks in.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)

          Grug CLOSES HIS EYES, and CONCENTRATES.
                         
          The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grug's brain.

          Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage.
          Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and
          startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS. He turns back
          to the Macawnivore.
                         
          The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug.
                         
                          GRUG
           Run!
          Grug leaps onto the Macawnivore's back as the birds move
          in closer. The ground begins to break up violently as
          lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.
                         
          The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug
          has coated with tar. The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage
          and stick to it. As they fight to free themselves, the
          rib cage lifts off the ground. Grug takes a giant tree
          branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the
          Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent
          direction.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Yes!
                         
          As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees
          Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his
          mouth.

           Douglas?
                         
          Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little
          monstrosity.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hey, I know that guy.
                         
          Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the
          gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding
          under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the
          TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip-
          Gerbils around his neck like a scarf.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Get up!
                         
          A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is
          SPEEDING closer.
                         
          Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage. He PUSHES
          it to go faster.
                         
                          GRUG (CONT'D)
           Hold on.
                         
          The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage.
          Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage CLEARS the edge
          of the cliff.
                         
          The CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a
          speck.

          horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears.
          Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is

          The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and

          The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug. Grug hugs
          each of them like never before.
                         
                          GRUG
           One, two, three, four, five, six...
                         
          Grug puts his arm around Guy.

           Well, a boys gotta have a pet.
                         
          Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands
          near them.

          Chunky SPITS OUT the TRIP-GERBILS. He GRINS sheepishly.
          The TRIP-GERBILS run to Gran knocking her over in their
          excitement.

           You really need to see this.
                         
          The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to
          Grug for his decision.
                         
                          GRUG

          waves lapping at the sand.

           EEP (V.O.)
           This is me. My name's Eep. And this, is
           my family. The Croods. If you weren't
           clued in by the sun tans and pets, we're
           not exactly cavemen anymore.
                         
          Grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are
          about to experience. The slab of rock smacks them all in

          BACK TO THE SHORELINE, RUSHING ever closer to the beach.

           Our world is still plenty harsh and

          On Ugga sharpening a spear. The Macawnivore comes in to
          frame with Grug riding on top. Ugga tosses him the spear.
          Eep, flips from out of the trees. She blows her horn to
          call Guy and the BearOwl for a ride.

          The Macawnivore LEAPS through the trees onto a broad,

          blends in at the crowded ballpark. Blue jeans, work boots, a

          a bag of popcorn. The CRACK of the bat and the CROWD is on

          double. JOHN SILVERSTEIN, thirty-three, business clad, talks
          on his cell phone. Calm and collected he appears unaffected
          by the cheering crowd. The sits with the crowd.

          The game is over. Rick and John stand at the front gate. The

                    family is a liability, not an

                               OFFICER TWO
                    Get `em where we can see `em
                    slimeball.
          
          Rick raises his hands, dropping his popcorn.
          
                                                                    11.
          
          
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    Oh, we got ourselves a litterbug
                    here.
          
                               RICK
                    What?
          
          Placing his pistol back in his holster Officer Two grabs Rick
          by the collar and throws him against the cruiser. Officer One
          remains drawn on Rick. His hands shake with nervous
          anticipation.
          
                              RICK
                    What's going...
          
                               OFFICER ONE
                    Shaddup!
          
          Officer Two cuffs Rick. Leaning in, he speaks in Rick's ear.
          
                              OFFICER TWO
                    You know your rights, cretin, but
                    just in case you don't...
          
                              RICK
                    What the hell? Officer Two spins
                    Rick to face him.
          
                              OFFICER TWO
                    You have the right to shut the hell
                    up. Do you understand this right?
          
                               RICK
                    Yes.
          
          Officer One appears very eager to discharge his weapon.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    Shut him the hell up, Jimmy.
          
                              OFFICER TWO
                    If you don't shut the hell up my
                    partner might exercise his right to
                    shoot you. Do you understand?
          
          `Yes' begins to form on Rick's lips. A quick glance at
          Officer One and he decides to nod.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    He's looking at me funny, Jimmy.
          
                                                                 12.
          
          
          
                              OFFICER TWO
                    You have the right not to look at
                    my partner in any way that might be
                    construed as `funny' which could
                    result in harm to your person. Do
                    you understand this right?
          
          Rick nods again.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    He twitching?
          
                              OFFICER TWO
                    Really? I don't think he is. Are
                    you twitching boy?
                                RICK
                    No Sir.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    Look at him, he's twitching.
                    Nothing pisses me off more than
                    twitching and talking. If he
                    doesn't stop I'm gonna waste him.
          
                              OFFICER TWO

                    shiver or make any other odd
                    movements that might encourage my
                    partner to discharge his weapon, do

          a gruff man in tweed.

                              OFFICER ONE
                    He's a twitcher... a twitcher and a
                    talker. Boy, I tell you, if he'd
                    twitched one more time I would've
                    deposited large amounts of hot lead
                    in his ass.

                    I'll take it from here boys.

                    Report too?
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    No, that's your job.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    If we have to write the report I
                    say I get to shoot him.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    No one's getting shot today, Bobby.
          
                              OFFICER ONE
                    Can't I just wing him or something?
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Jimmy; get him out of here.
          
          Officer Two moves to his unwilling partner and helps him
          place his weapon in his holster. Officer One's hand is still
          clenched to his gun as Officer Two drags him around the car
          and forces him into the cruiser.

          FIVE diverse MEN, including Rick, stand against the wall. On

          covering her eyes, circa 1930's.

                    Take your time, Ma'am. We need you

                    Turn to your left. The men follow

                    Back to front.
          
          Three men turn to face forward. The other two turn to face

                    Could you have him step forward?
          
          The Detective keys his microphone again.
          
                              DETECTIVE JOHNSON
                    Number three take two steps
                    forward.
          
          Rick steps forward and the lights dim on the other four.
          Caught in the spotlight, Rick squints from the brightness.
          The lady in black shifts in her seat. A long beat.

                    ...and exit.
          
          One by one the men filter through the door. Rick EXITS.

          INT. THEATER - CONTINUOUS
          
          Rick ENTERS on stage. The entire theater is cast in shades of
          gray. The stage is barren. There is no audience. He looks
          around for a moment and as he reaches center stage is once
          again flooded with the spotlight. Rick uses his arm to shade
          his eyes. SFX: A SOFT DIN OF VOICES. Looking stage left Rick
          realizes TWELVE JURORS have appeared in their box. A small
          AUDIENCE has congregated. SFX: THE DIN SWELLS TO A QUIET
          CHAOS. A RAPPING of a gavel and Rick's attention swings to a
          white haired JUDGE (70's).
          
                              JUDGE
                    Order in the court.
          
          The noise level wanes, but not completely. Another RAP of the
          gavel.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Order in the court, I say.
          
          Focused on the Judge, Rick doesn't notice THE PROSECUTOR
          approaching from stage right.
          
                                                                   17.
          
          
          Carrying a folding chair in one hand, notes and manila

                    Have a seat.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Do you know why you're here today,
                    Mr. Stevens?
          
                              RICK
                    Why am I here?
          
                              JUDGE
                    Are you being rhetorical?
          
                              RICK
                    Are you asking me?
          
                              JUDGE
                    You stand here today an accused
                    man.
          
                              RICK
                    Accused? Accused of what?
          
                              JUDGE
                    You have been placed in custody of
                    your children.
          
                                 RICK
                    Huh?
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Your children, Mr. Stevens. You do
                    realize you have children, don't
                    you?
          
                              RICK
                    Yes, but...
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    But nothing Mr. Stevens, either you
                    have children or you don't.
          
                                 RICK
                    I do.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    So, you accept responsibility for
                    bringing young life into the world?
          
                                 RICK
                    I guess...
          
                                               18.
          
          
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          There's no guessing, Mr. Stevens,
          either you're responsible for
          siring offspring or you aren't.
          
                    RICK
          I am, but I'm not sure it was
          responsible.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          A crime of passion, Mr. Stevens?
          How convenient.
              (A beat)
          And you accept the consequences of
          said actions?
                    RICK
          Why am I here?
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Why are you here, Mr. Stevens? Why
          are you here? I'll tell you why
          you're here. Are you familiar with
          Ms. Cynthia Stevens?
          
                    RICK
          Yeah, she's my wife.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Was your wife, Sir. Was your wife.
          She recently filed for divorce.
          Were you aware of that?
          
                    RICK
          No, no I wasn't.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Well, she did. She also named you
          as her coconspirator in the act of
          having children. Were you aware of
          that, Mr. Stevens?
          
                       RICK
          Again, no.
          
                    PROSECUTOR
          Mr. Stevens, you just told the
          court that you aware you had
          children. You have also admitted
          that Ms. Cynthia Stevens was, in
          fact, your wife.

                              PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)
                    On top of that you told this court
                    that you accepted the
                    responsibility of having said
                    children, did you not?
          
                              RICK
                    Yes, but...
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Then why, Mr. Stevens, do you
                    continue to deny culpability in
                    this situation?
          
          Rick realizes the audience has swelled to nearly a full
          house. Beads of sweat form on his brow.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Answer the question.
          
                              AUDIENCE
                    Answer the question.
          
          Like a trapped animal, Rick looks for his escape.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    The question, Mr. Stevens.
          
                              RICK
                    How can you be sure it was me?
          
          The audience hisses. The Judge RAPS his gavel.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    She picked you out of a lineup,
                    Sir. What more do you need?
          
                              RICK
                    Time.
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Time is not an option, Mr. Stevens.
                    Time --- is not --- an option.
          
          A look of sad resignation crosses Rick's face.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    You don't deny being married to Ms.
                    Stevens, nor do you deny the act of
                    procreation. You seem to understand
                    that your actions bear consequence.
                    You seem to understand that with
                    parenthood, came responsibility.

                              PRO SECUT OR (cont'd)
                    It seems to me, as it should to
                    anyone with the capacity for simple
                    deduction that you, Mr. Stevens,
                    did willingly and knowingly enter
                    into the commitments of parenthood
                    fully aware of the potential
                    pratfalls. Did you not?
          
                              RICK
                    Yes, yes I did.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    It's time to pay the piper, Mr.
                    Stevens.
                        (To the Judge)
                    It is the recommendation of the
                    State that Richard C. Stevens been
                    sentenced to the fullest capacity
                    allowed by law.
          
                              RICK
                    What about Cindy?
          
                                 PROSECUTOR
                    Excuse me?
          
                              RICK
                    My ex, Cindy, what about her
                    responsibilities to the children?
          
          The Prosecutor moves to Rick and whispers in his ear.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    She cut a deal, Rick. You were the
                    one we wanted. You were the one we
                    got. She took the plea. Sure, it
                    costs her financially. But what is
                    freedom worth?
          A CLAMOR begins to rise from the crowd as they talk among
          themselves. The RAP of the gavel.
          
                              JUDGE
                    I see no reason to extend this any
                    further. Mr. Stevens you have been
                    found competent by the State and by
                    this Court. You are completely
                    cognizant of your surroundings, and
                    you leave me no choice. This court
                    finds you guilty as charged.
          
                              RICK
                    Guilty of what?
          
                                                                 21.
          
          
          
                              JUDGE
                    You are hereby remanded to custody
                    of your children for no less than a
                    lifetime. This Court is adjourned.
          
          A GASP in the audience mixed with CHEERS. Rick appears
          dumbfounded. A BAILIFF approaches Rick and begins to lead him
          off stage. Rick scuffles and struggles. The Judge stands and
          begins to collect his files.
          
                              RICK
                    I can't do this alone. Don't make
                    me do this alone. I'll never make
                    it...
          
                              JUDGE
                    If you can't do the time, Mr.
                    Stevens, then don't do the crime.

          Come here guys. I want to talk to
          you. The boys gather round.
          
                    PHILLIP
          What's wrong Daddy?
          
                    RICK
          I don't know when we're going to
          see your mom again.

          Is she okay?
          
                    RICK
          She's kind of mad at daddy.
          
                    NICHOLAS
          Mommy mad at me too?
          
                    RICK
          No, baby, not at all. Your mom
          needs time to work through some
          things. So, for awhile, it's just
          going to be us...
          
                                                                 23.

                              RICK
                    To figure out who she is, where
                    she's going, what she wants.
          
                              NICHOLAS
                    I miss mommy.
          
                              RICK
                    She misses you too, baby. And this
                    isn't permanent... we're going to
                    fight this... we're going to
                    appeal. We'll take it to the
                    Supreme Court if we have to.
                              KRIS
                    You don't want us either?
          
                              RICK
                    Of course I want you. I just don't
                    think I should have to do this

          The jailer still lingers in the doorway, leaning against the
          bars.

                    I feel for you, I really do, but
                    I've seen your kind before. You're
                    a lifer. Whether it's fair or not.
                    Whether justice was served. It
                    doesn't matter. You're here for the
                    duration.
          
          The boys cling to their father. The CLANK of the door being
          closed. The Jailer WHISTLES a sad spiritual as he walks away.

                    feels like you're in prison, but
                    you gotta be a man... stand up for

                    Insurance?
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Yeah, Insurance. That thing that
                    covers medical emergencies?
          
                              RICK
                    I don't think I have any.
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    Everybody has insurance.
          
                              RICK
                    I don't think I do.
          
                                 RECEPTIONIST
                    Okay.
          
          The receptionist slides a bill across the desk. From Rick's
          POV: the bill he holds shows a balance due of
          
          $637.50
          
                              RICK
                    Can I run a tab?
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          
                              RECEPTIONIST
                    You don't have a check?

          EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          
          Rick walks with his mother. The boys and their Grandfather
          are a few steps ahead.
          
                              RICK
                    I'm not even responsible for
                    myself. How am I suppose to raise
                    three kids?
          
                              MOTHER
                    It can be done.
          
                              RICK
                    I don't see how.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Find a way. Everything happens for
                    a reason. God doesn't abandon his
                    children, and neither will you.
          
                              RICK
                    God doesn't pay day-care.
          
                              MOTHER
                    There are other things out there...
                    less expensive ways.
          
                              RICK
                    Could you watch them?
          
                              MOTHER
                    Oh... uh... well... I don't think
                    your father is willing to do that.
                    We raised our kids, Rick.
          
                              RICK
                    How `bout tonight, so I can catch a
                    breath?
          
                              MOTHER
                    What? My watching them while you
                    were in there with Phillip wasn't
                    enough? Make me feel guilty.
          
                              RICK
                    I'll just ask God to watch them. He
                    never abandons his children.
          
                                                                 44.
          
          
          
          Rick's mom reaches in her purse and pulls some bills from her
          wallet.
          
                                 MOTHER
                    Take this.
          
                              RICK
                    I don't want your money mom.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Take the money.
          
          As Rick puts the money in his pocket he finds the flyer.

                    I can't do it Daddy.
          
                              RICK
                    You can do it.
          
                              NICHOLAS
                    I can't do it.
          
                              RICK
                    Would you do it for a nickel?
          
                              NICHOLAS
                    I can't do it.
          
          Rick lifts the child from the toilet.
          
                              RICK
                    Watch daddy.
          
          Rick stands in front of the toilet and relieves himself.
          Nicholas watches by his side. He finishes and zips himself
          up.
          
                              RICK
                    Daddy go potty in the potty.

          Rick turns around to find MELANIE (24) looking in.
          
                                 RICK
                    Hi.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I'm Melanie... The baby-sitter...
          
                              RICK
                    Oh, right, I'm glad you could...

                    I was just demonstrating the art

                              MELANIE
                    It's okay. I saw.
          
                              RICK
                        (Mumbling)
                    Great.
          
          Melanie ENTERS the cell followed by Zach.
          
                              RICK
                    You have a kid.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    So do you.
          
                              RICK
                    Not criticizing, just surprised. I
                    don't believe anyone at their old
                    day-care had kids. If they did they
                    kept them in a closet and only
                    brought them out on special
                    occasions. Christmas, Easter, an
                    occasional birthday, and maybe when
                    they had friends over for dinner,
                    but only as a status symbol. It was
                    like they'd say, "Here's the white
                    picket fence. Here's the SUV.
                    Here's the dog. Oh yes, here's the
                    2.5 children. Kids you can get back
                    in the closet now."
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
          
                              MELANIE
                    You'd could make a fortune with a
                    Renta- Kid business.
          
                              RICK
                    That has potential.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I've often thought of renting mine.
                    Why pay for a baby-sitter when
                    thousands of people would pay good
                    money to set your kid on the mantle
                    for a few hours?
          
                              RICK
                    So, what's his name?
                                ZACH
                    I'm Zach.
          
          Rick drops to a knee and extends his hand.
          
                              RICK
                    Hello Zach. I'm Rick.
          
                              ZACH
                    You're old.
          
                              RICK
                    You got me there. I am old.
          
                                ZACH
                    How old?
          
                              RICK
                    Older than dirt. When I was a kid
                    we didn't have dirt. We had rocks
                    and we had hammers. If we wanted
                    dirt we banged a few rocks with
                    really big hammers, and then we had
                    dirt.

                    Worked the chain gangs?
          
                              ZACH
                    You're too old for my mom.
          
          Kris and Phillip who have been sitting in the corner realize
          they have visitors and spring to greet them.

                    This is Kristian. This is Phillip,
                    and the little guy from the potty,
                    is Nicholas. Guys, this is Zach

          The four boys run OS to play.

                    Beautiful kids.
                              RICK
                    Thanks. So's your's.

                    Ever try Cheerios?
          
                              RICK
                    Huh?
          
                              MELANIE
                    For potty training. Give him
                    something to aim at. Drop a Cheerio
                    or two in the toilet and let him
                    pee away.
          
                              RICK
                    I'll have to try that. So, any
                    questions about the job? Melanie
                    moves towards the boys.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I'm going to go talk to them for a
                    little bit. I'll let you know.
          
          Melanie crouches to the boy's level. They appear to take a
          real shine to her. Nicholas hands her a book, and the four of
          them move to the cell cot. The boys gather round.

                    My mom tells great stories.
          
                              KRIS
                    We don't have a mom.
          
                              ZACH
                    That's okay, I don't have a dad.

                    Not a knack really. It's just about
                    finding hope in places there should
                    be none.
          
                              RICK
                    Whatever it is, I've never seen
                    them take to a woman like that.

                    the work. She didn't realize the
                    third would double the work load
                    would again. And to think you do it

                    just comes so instinctively even
                    though I've never had kids myself.
                    I get lots of practice with my

                    Mr. Stevens, I wish I could make
                    that promise, but the odds of an
                    adoptive family willing to take
                    them all is astronomical.
          
          Rick stands.

          Rick sits at the picnic table reading a book. The boys are
          off playing. Kris falls. He grabs his knee and cries. Rick
          drops his book and runs to the child. GUARDS on duty pay no
          attention. Rick reaches the child. The injury appears rather
          serious.

          His calls go unanswered.
          
          A tear forms in his eyes. Months of frustration boil in his
          face. A CONVICT passing by kneels by Rick.

                       Four. Two on top and two on bottom.
                       He got a quarter for the first one,
                       fifty cents for the next two and he
                       parlayed the last into an even
                       dollar. Nicholas cries at night
                       because he thinks the house is

                       on the forehead, once on the cheek
                       and sing The Cradle Will Rock and
                       he'll sleep the whole night
                       through. Kris' favorite subject is
                       math. He loves to read and write,
                       but he doesn't do so well in social

          up, scattered PEOPLE sit at different levels on the climb.

          Rick stretches out. The boys jog in place. Rick cracks his
          neck. The boys crack their knuckles. In SLOW MOTION they
          begin their ascent, running wildly up the incline. Rick falls
          flat on his face. The boys all trip over him, leaving them
          all in a pile. Rick bounces up and dusts himself off. The
          boys do the same and away they go.

                    that you would burden this court
                    with convening today?
          
                              RICK
                    I just needed clarification.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    On what, Mr. Stevens? On what?
          
                              RICK
                    I know if I have to, I can do this
                    alone, but do I have to do this
                    alone? A hushed MURMUR rises in the
                    audience. The Judge RAPS his gavel
                    on the bench.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Order in this court! A beat as
                    things quiet down.
          
                              JUDGE (CONT'D)
                    Your inquiry, Mr. Stevens? Is it in
                    the best interest of the children
                    or in the best interest of you?
          
                              RICK
                    I don't know.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    He doesn't know. He just doesn't
                    know.
                              RICK
                    I don't know.
          
                              JUDGE
                    Then this court sees no reason to
                    amend the original verdict. The
                    order stands.
          
                              RICK
                    But...
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Tell it to someone who cares, Mr.
                    Stevens.
          
                                                                 87.
          
          
          
                              RICK
                    I have. I have laid my heart out on
                    the line time and time again, only
                    to walk away empty handed. This
                    love, this caring, this sharing of
                    life, it's a sentence and my heart
                    has been condemned. It doesn't
                    matter who I've told, what's in my
                    heart is never quite enough. The
                    people I have cared for most have
                    shunned me in life and in love.
                    Unanswered phone calls... Unnoticed
                    displays of affection... A rose
                    that withers on the doorstep... No
                    matter what I do, it's never
                    enough. Just once, just one fucking
                    time, I want to be enough.
          
                              PROSECUTOR
                    Your only condemnation is self-
                    pity. You have people that care all
                    around you, but you're too blind to
                    see them. If you don't pull
                    yourself together soon, my friend,
                    they soon will all be gone.

          EXT. PARK - DAY
          
          In B&W SLO-MO: Rick stands watching his sons play. The wind
          blows the leaves of a tree. The boys run further and further
          out until they are out of sight. Rick calls out to them.
          Slowly, across the field, three young adults return. Rick is
          now an old man, hunched over and aged with wrinkles. The
          three young men walk beside their elderly father, supporting
          him with each step.
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          EXT. MELANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
          
          Rick is holding flowers. The boys have an assortment of
          "instruments" to add a serenade. The music is a mishmash of
          odd notes that could only be construed as music to a parent's
          ear. Melanie stands on the front porch, her arms crossed.
          
                              MELANIE
                    What do you want?
          
                              RICK
                    I'm a proud man, sometimes foolish.
          
                                                                 88.
          
          
          
                              MELANIE
                    Go on.
          
                              RICK
                    I have a long way to go before I
                    could ever be the man you need me
                    to be.
          
                              MELANIE
                    And?
          
                               RICK
                    And I got confused between what I
                    should have done and what I thought
                    was right.
                              MELANIE
                    Yes you did.
          
                              RICK
                    I put you on a pedestal and then I
                    knocked you down. It wasn't fair.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Life's not fair Rick.
          
                              RICK
                    You were more a mother to my boys
                    than they have ever known. You were
                    more a woman to me than I have ever
                    deserved.
          
                              MELANIE
                    You're right.
          
                              RICK
                    You're not going to make this easy,
                    are you?
                              MELANIE
                    Cut the bullshit, Rick.
          
          Rick wraps his arms around Melanie and pulls her in for a
          hug.
          
                              RICK
                        (In Mel's ear)
                    I can live my life alone. I can
                    raise my kids alone. I can walk
                    this path alone. I'd much rather do
                    it with you.
          
                                                                 89.
          
          
          
          Grabbing him by the collar she's torn. Melanie shakes her
          head.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    I can't.
          
          She turns to go inside.
          
                                 RICK
                    Can't?
          
                              MELANIE
                        (Turning back around.)
                    I won't.
          
                              RICK
                    I shouldn't have come here.
          
                              MELANIE
                    No, you shouldn't have.
          
          Rick turns to leave.
          
                              MELANIE
                    You just don't get it do you?
          
                                 RICK
                    Get what?
          
                              MELANIE
                    You're here for you, you selfish
                    prick.

          Melanie lays in bed covering her ears.
                              MELANIE (VO)
                    Days go by when I lose me. There
                    are nights when I lay in bed and I
                    can hear Zach through the walls.
                    He's crying out for me, and I lay
                    there motionless, wishing I was
                    anyone but me, anywhere but here,
                    thinking that somewhere, sometime,
                    there has to be room for me. But
                    that someday never seems to come.
                    You're dangerous. Loving you means
                    I lose me. And I will never lose
                    let that happen.

                    asking for my heart, if you don't
                    have room for me.
          
          Melanie ENTERS the house closing the door behind her. Rick
          tosses the flowers on the porch, turns and walks away. The
          boys follow behind.

          She's my best friend... or was.

          It only confuses things.

                              RICK
                    I thought you had things all
                    planned out.
          
                              JOHN
                    Affairs of the heart and those of
                    the mind are two different things.
          
                              RICK
                    It's not too late, you know?
          
          With a shrug John drops to one knee in front of Rick.
          
                              RICK
                    Go Home, John. Go home and talk to
                    your best friend the way you talk
                    to me.
          
          INT. PARENT'S HOUSE
          
          Rick BURSTS through the front door. His mother appears
          aghast.
          
                              RICK
                    I need you to watch the boys.
          
                              MOTHER
                    But you're father...
          
          Rick's Father ENTERS.
          
                              FATHER
                    Woman, enough.
          
                                MOTHER
                    But...
          
                                                                 93.
          
          
          
                              FATHER
                    No more excuses. It's time to live
                    life and enjoy our grandkids.
                        (To Rick)
                    Go. The boys will be fine.
          
                              MOTHER
                    Can't we just give him money to pay
                    for a baby-sitter?
          
          Rick BOLTS out of the house.
          
                                                   CUT TO:
          
          INT. RESTAURANT
          Melanie is working as a waitress. She's pouring coffee when
          she sees Rick.
          
                              MELANIE
                        (To herself)
                    Oh shit.
          
                               CUSTOMER
                    Whoa!
          
          The cup has nearly reached the brim.
          
                               MELANIE
                    Sorry.
          
                              CUSTOMER
                    Pay attention, would ya?
          
          Rick reaches her.
          
                              MELANIE
                    What do you want?
                               RICK
                    To talk.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I'm working.
          
                               RICK
                    I know.
          
          Melanie is at the next customer who early awaits a refill,
          but she doesn't pour.
          
                              MELANIE
                    So, where are the boys?
          
                                                                 94.
          
          
          
                              RICK
                    They're at my parents.
          
                              MELANIE
                    What? Not going to use them to try
                    to persuade me with guilt?
          
                              RICK
                    Is that what you thought?
          
                              MELANIE
                    I have a son of my own. I know when
                    people are using their kids.
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                    Ma'am.
                              RICK
                        (To Customer 2)
                    Excuse us for a moment okay?
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                    I'd just like some coffee.
          
          Melanie walks off. Rick grabs a cup from a recently vacated
          table and sets it in front of the patron.
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                        (Calling out.)
                    Excuse me, Miss?
          
                              RICK
                    What is your problem?
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                    Cold.
          
                              RICK
                    What?
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                    The coffee, it's cold.
          
          Rick picks up the cup, pulls a lighter from his pocket and
          runs it several times under the mug.
          
                              RICK
                        (Setting the cup back
                         down.)
                    Quit your bitching.
          
          Rick moves to Melanie.
          
                                                                 95.
          
          
          
                              MELANIE
                    I can't believe you came here.
          
                              RICK
                    I can't believe you're a waitress.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Beats chasing around after snot
                    nosed brats all day.
          
                              RICK
                    I thought you liked my kids.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I was talking about you.
          Melanie moves on. Rick gives chase. He catches her and spins
          her around spilling coffee all over the floor.
          
                              RICK
                    I deserved that.
          
                              MELANIE
                    So, what do the kids need? A
                    babysitter? A surrogate mom?
          
                              RICK
                    This isn't about the kids.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Then what's it about?
          
                              RICK
                    It's about me, the selfish prick.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    About you?
                              RICK
                    Hear me out, okay?
          
                              MELANIE
                        (Looking at her watch.)
                    You have 15 seconds.
          
                              RICK
                    Okay, okay.
          
                                 MELANIE
                    Ten.
          
                                                          96.
          
          
          
                              RICK
                    Melanie, there is a grace about you
                    that reminds me how clumsy I am.
                    There is an honesty about you that
                    reminds me how deceitful I can be.
                    There is a beauty in your eyes that
                    reminds me how ugly I've become.
                    There is a kindness in your voice
                    that contradicts my coarseness.
                    There is a glow around you that
                    illuminates my dullness. There is
                    spirit in you that challenges my
                    laziness, but most of all, there is
                    a woman in you, that sparks my
                    desire, a desire to be graceful and
                    honest and beautiful and kind. A
                    desire to be better than I am or
                    ever thought I could be.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Go on.
          
                              RICK
                    I think my ten seconds are up.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Who's counting?
          
                              CUSTOMER 2
                    Miss... My coffee?
          
          Melanie sets the coffee on a nearby table.
          
                              MELANIE
                    Get it yourself.
          
                              RICK
                    I love you.
                              MELANIE
                    I don't think I heard you.
          
                              RICK
                    If I give you my heart will you
                    promise to treat it softly? Kiss it
                    when it hurts? Put it in a box and
                    know that it belongs to you?
          
                              MELANIE
                    That's not what you said.
          
                              RICK
                    I said I love you.
          
                                                                 97.
          
          
          
                              MELANIE
                    As brutal as that can be?
          
                              RICK
                    I love you. I love you, I love you,
                    I love you.
          
                              MELANIE
                    I kind of like you too.
          
                                                     CUT TO:
          
          EXT. GORGE PARK - DAY
          
          Rick comes to another plateau and finds Melanie waiting for
          him.
                              MELANIE
                    I never thought you'd make it.
          
                              RICK
                    Been waiting long?
          
                              MELANIE
                    I never thought you'd find me.
          
                              RICK
                    I had to find me first. I hope you
                    plan on walking, cause I'm not sure
                    I can carry you.
          
                              MELANIE
                    So, how do we do this? The two
                    begin the ascent together.
          
                              RICK
                    One step at a time?
                              MELANIE
                    Side by side?
          
                              RICK
                    Maybe you could carry me?
          
          Rick jumps in Melanie's arms. They tumble to the ground under
          his weight.
          
                                                     CUT TO:
          
          INT. SMALL SUBURBAN HOME
          
          Rick packs his things in boxes. A knock at the door and the
          room morphs back into the cell.
          
                                                                 98.

          Rick turns around to see the jailer standing at the door.
          
                              JAILER
                    Getting out of here, huh?
          
                              RICK
                    It's time to move on.
          
                              JAILER
                    If you leave don't ever come back.
          
                              RICK
                    Not even...
                              JAILER
                    Not even on a visit. You're a very
                    ugly man. I'd hate to explain to

                    It's funny, the tricks the mind can
                    play on you... but the Judge, he
                    sat right over there... and the
                    jury sat right there... and the
                    audience was filled with all these
                    people who didn't really give a
                    shit about me.

                              RICK
                    And they all sat passing judgement
                    on me, not knowing the situation,
                    just staring over their schoolmarm
                    spectacles and pointing their
                    crooked fingers.

          TIGHT SHOT on AARON (CHRIS ROCK) thirties, dressed in a black
          suit and tie. He looks straight ahead with a somber expression.
          The camera pulls back to reveal he is watching FOUR UNDERTAKERS
          (INCLUDING BRIAN) place a coffin on a raised platform.

          The living room has been prepared for the funeral service, with
          several rows of chairs laid out.

          Would you like to see...
          Aaron nods his head "yes", as BRIAN begins to open the coffin.
          Aaron crosses to the coffin.
          There's a dramatic moment as Aaron moves to the coffin and
          braces himself for what he's about to see. The coffin opens and
          Aaron stares long and hard at the body.

                         AARON
          Brian... who is that?

                         BRIAN
          Excuse me?

                         AARON
          Who is this man I'm looking at?
          'Cause it's not my father.

                         BRIAN
          Are you sure?

                         AARON
          Are you asking me if I'm sure I know
          what my father looks like?

                         BRIAN
          People make mistakes in times of
          grief.

                         AARON
          Man, look at the damn body!
          Brian peers into the coffin. We see it's an ASIAN MAN.

                         BRIAN
          Oh shit!
          The other undertakers look embarrassed.

                         AARON
          Come on, Brian. You know what my
          father looks like. He used to take
          you to little league.

                         BRIAN
          I'm sorry, man. I got a little
          nervous. This almost never happens.

          Burger King. You can't just mess up
          my order.

                         BRIAN
          I think I know where he is.

          an hour, or you're going to take his
          place.
          The undertakers pick up the coffin and shuffle out awkwardly.

                         BRIAN
          Don't worry. I'll get him, man.

                         AARON
          You do that.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Aaron enters the bedroom. His wife, MICHELLE, also thirties,
          attractive, is putting on makeup with a thermometer hanging from
          her mouth. Aaron stands looking dumbfounded.

                         AARON
          They brought the wrong body. Can you
          believe that?

                         THERMOMETER)
          The wrong body?! Do they know where
          he is?

                         AARON
          They think so. They're getting him
          now.
          The thermometer beeps and Michelle removes it from her mouth..

                         MICHELLE
          I told you not to use Marshals. But
          no, you wanted to keep it in the
          neighborhood. I know Swartz costs a
          little more, but at least they know
          where the bodies are.
          Michelle writes something down on a piece of paper as Aaron
          crosses the room and sits on the bed.

                         AARON
          You were right. Please don't rub it
          in, not today. I've got so much to
          worry about.
          Michelle gets up and heads to the bathroom as Aaron takes out
          some index cards and looks them over.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Dad insisted on having the funeral
          here, Mom's crying all the time, Ryan
          didn't help with anything, not like he
          ever does! Plus my eulogy sucks. I
          can't wait until this day is over.

          MICHELLE (O.S.)
          Oh come on, honey. I'm sure it's not
          that bad.

                         AARON
          If it is, at least Dad's too dead to
          hear it.
          Michelle exits the bathroom.

                         MICHELLE
          Honey, it's going to be fine.

          It doesn't matter what I write. All
          anybody's going to be thinking is "why
          isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? Even I'm
          going to be thinking it.
          She holds him close.

                         MICHELLE
          Baby, you're the oldest. You have to
          do the eulogy. Besides, I think
          you're just as good a writer as your
          brother. You just need to let someone
          read your book.
          Aaronlooks away.

                         AARON
          Soon. It's not ready to be read yet.

                         MICHELLE
          I'm sure it's fine. Once the
          funeral's over, and everything dies

                         DOWN--
          Aaron gives her a look.

                         MICHELLE (CONT'D)
          Sorry. Look, once this is all over,
          you know your mom's thinking about
          selling the house, so you know we've
          got to get out.of here.
          Aaron looks a little uncomfortable and heads to the bathroom.

                         MICHELLE (CONT'D)
          You called them, right?
          Silence from Aaron in the next room.

                         MICHELLE (CONT'D)
          Aaron?... You put the down payment on
          the condo, right?

          AARON (O.C.)
          I said I'd take care of it and I'll
          take care of it.
          Michelle looks frustrated and crosses into the bathroom.

          You better, because I can't live with
          your mother anymore. I've done my
          time, now it's time for your brother
          to take over. From now on, it's only
          Christmas and birthdays for us. Once
          we move, we can concentrate on your
          writing and our baby.
          Michelle gets down on her knees and starts unzipping Aaron's
          pants. Aaron pulls back.

                         AARON
          Hey, hey, hey. Are you serious? We
          have to do this today?
          Michelle is still on the ground.

                         MICHELLE
          Yes. Today's the last day of this
          cycle.

                         AARON
          Can I at least find the body first?

          INT. NORMAN'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

          NORMAN, black, slightly heavier and riddled with anxiety, is
          driving. His friend, DEREK, an attractive, white, clean cut
          doctor, rides in the passenger seat.

          I hate funerals. It's all death,
          death, death.

                         DEREK
          I don't think funerals are designed
          for anybody to really like.

                         NORMAN
          I don't want a regular funeral. When
          I die, I want people to celebrate my
          life.

                         DEREK
          Not me. I want it to be the saddest
          day ever. I want the stock market to
          stop. Schools to close. And no
          garbage pick-up.
          Derek starts to light a cigarette.

                         NORMAN
          You still smoke?

                         DEREK
          You used to smoke.

                         NORMAN
          I used to piss my pants too, but I
          stopped. The only thing I want black
          is my skin. At least open the window.
          Derek opens the window very slightly.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          I've got enough problems of my own to
          deal with.

                         DEREK

                         (DUBIOUS)
          Yeah? What problems?

                         NORMAN
          I told you... About the rash...

                         DEREK
          Got to use condoms.

                         NORMAN
          .on my hand...

                         DEREK
          Still got to use condoms.

                         NORMAN
          Look at it.
           Norman pulls up his sleeve and makes Derek look at his wrist,
          but he doesn't take a great deal of interest.

                         DEREK
          That's not a rash.

                         NORMAN
          What is it?

                         (CONTINUED)

          I don't know, but it doesn't look
          right.

                         NORMAN
          Oh, damn.
          Norman continues to drive. Derek continues to smoke.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          If you hate funerals so much why are
          you coming?

                         DEREK
          You know why.

                         NORMAN
          Come on, man, leave Elaine alone.

                         DEREK
          I can't. She's the one.

                         NORMAN
          So you're going to win her back over a
          dead body?

                         DEREK
          If I have to.

          INT. ELAINE'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

          ELAINE, very attractive, 27, and her boyfriend OSCAR, white, 35,
          are driving along wearing funeral attire. Oscar looks quite
          anxious as he keeps his eyes firmly on the road.

                         ELAINE
          Are you okay?

                         OSCAR
          Yeah, just a little nervous...

                         ELAINE
          About seeing my dad?

                         OSCAR
          I just don't think I've ever been so
          openly hated by anyone before.

                         ELAINE
          He doesn't hate you. He just loved
          Derek.

                         OSCAR
          Great. That makes me feel much
          better.

                         ELAINE
          At least you know it's not you, so try
          not to get so nervous when he's
          around.

                         OSCAR
          I can't help it. He puts me on edge.
          I feel like I owe him money.

                         ELAINE
          He's going to be more.concerned that
          his brother-in-law just died. He
          won't be focused on you. Anyway, when
          I tell him we're getting married,
          he'll have to accept you.
          Elaine takes his hand. As they exchange a loving look, Oscar
          takes his eyes off the road for just a brief moment. Suddenly
          there's a BUMP!!! And we see a bicyclist flying over Oscar's
          car. Oscar screeches to a halt. They jump out of the car.

                         OSCAR
          Oh my God. Are you okay?
          The guy gets up. He's fine.

                         BIKE GUY
          Yeah, I'm fine.

                         OSCAR
          Are you sure? Is anything broken?
          I'm so sorry.

                         BIKE GUY
          It was my fault. I ran a light.
          Oscar starts hyperventilating.

                         OSCAR
          I could have killed you. What if you
          had cracked your head open? I'd have
          blood on my hands!
          Elaine shakes him.

                         ELAINE
          Oscar, calm down!

          Come on, let's get out of here before
          he wants to sue.
          She grabs him and pulls him into the car.

          INT. BATHROOM - DAY

          The camera is close on Michelle's head which is moving back and
          forth. We pull back to reveal Aaron. They are doing it
          standing up.

                         MICHELLE
          What's taking you so long?

                         AARON
          I just started.

                         MICHELLE
          You want this baby as much me. Come
          on.

                         AARON
          I'm trying.

                         MICHELLE
          If I didn't want you to come, you
          would have done it five minutes ago.

                         AARON
          Do I have to do this today?
          The door opens and a HOUSEKEEPER sticks her head in.

                         HOUSEKEEPER
          Who's picking up Uncle Russell?--
          Aaron and Elaine quickly pull apart. As the Housekeeper steps
          back out into the hall.

                         AARON
          Oh shit, Uncle Russell.
          Aaron fixes his pants as he exits the room.

          Uncle Russell?! Damn! He's always in

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS


                         AARON
          It's not a mood if he's always in it.
          It's his personality. Can you do it?

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Aaron and Michelle are standing to the side as the undertakers
          place the coffin on the stand.
          Brian nervously lifts the lid and Aaron looks inside.

                         BRIAN

                         (RESPECTFUL)
          So is this your father?

          He closes the lid and all four undertakers quietly head off.
          Aaron looks up and sees his mother, Cynthia, has entered the
          room. Cynthia is clearly drained and tired. She stares at the
          coffin.

                         AARON
          Mom, how are you feeling?

                         CYNTHIA
          There were so many things we wanted to
          do... We were going to go to China.

                         AARON
          China? You don't even like Chinese
          food.

                         CYNTHIA
          That's not the point. I haven't been
          feeling good. Who knows how long I'm
          going to live without him. It happens
          all the time. One spouse goes and
          then the next. I mean, it might be
          different if I had a grandchild to
          take my mind off of everything.

                         MICHELLE
          Cynthia, I--
          They all cross to the coffin.

                         AARON
          (cuts Michelle off)
          Come on, Mom. You're healthy. You'll
          be fine. You've got your friends and
          family...
          Cynthia, Aaron and Michelle stand around the coffin.

                         CYNTHIA
          Where is Ryan? Have you heard from
          him?

                         AARON
          He'll be here soon.

                         CYNTHIA
          Just seeing that boy's face makes me
          feel better. I've missed him so much.

          Michelle gently touches the coffin.

          Do you need anything, Cynthia?

                         CYNTHIA
          Yeah, you can get your hand off my
          husband's coffin. You're leaving
          smudge marks.
          Michelle tries to wipe it off with her sleeve.

          Elaine and Oscar are walking up the stairs of a typical college
          apartment building.

          INT. JEFF'S HOUSE - SAME

          The music is coming from Jeff's speakers. JEFF, dressed for the
          funeral, sits at his desk. He's holding a pill bottle that
          says: "VALIUM."

                         JEFF
          Yeah, I found them. The ones in the
          Valium bottle?... Yeah... I'll get
          them to you this evening... Can't do
          this afternoon... It's your fault you
          left them here... I've got a
          funeral... My uncle died... Yeah,
          tragic... No, I haven't taken any. I
          saw what they did to you... What are
          they anyway?...
          The doorbell rings.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          I've gotta go, my sister's here...
          I'll take them with me and stop by
          after the funeral... Bye.
          The doorbell rings again.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Hang on!
          Jeff stands up and we see that he's only half dressed for the
          funeral. He doesn't have any pants on.

                         CONTINUED:
          He puts the bottle on the counter then crosses to the door and
          lets Elaine and Oscar inside.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)
          Hey, what's up?

                         ELAINE
          Do you always open the door half
          naked? Come on, Jeff. We're going to
          be late.

                         JEFF
          I've just got to put my pants on and
          I'm ready.
          Oscar is still a little shaky.

                         JEFF (CONT'D)

                         (RE: OSCAR)
          Is he okay?

                         ELAINE
          Oscar's freaked out. A guy on a bike
          ran into the car.

                         OSCAR
          It came out of nowhere. I didn't see
          him. I'm sorry.

                         ELAINE
          It's okay, baby.
          (then to Jeff)
          Go put your damn pants on.

                         JEFF
          I'm going. I'm going.
          Jeff heads off to the bathroom and closes the door. Elaine
          spots the bottle of Valium on the table and picks it up.

                         ELAINE
          Here. Take this..: It'll calm you
          down.

                         OSCAR
          What is it?

                         ELAINE
          It's just Valium.
          (gets a glass of water)
          I used to take them all the time...

          It'll be okay. I'll drive, honey.
          Come on, open wide.
          She pops the pill in his mouth and hands him some water. Oscar
          swallows.
          Jeff returns wearing pants.

                         JEFF
          Ready. Let's do it.
          Oscar and Elaine leave, Jeff surreptitiously picks up the Valium
          bottle, puts it in his pocket, then follows them out.

          INT/EXT. ENTRY WAY - SAME TIME

          CAMERA is in the entry way now shooting outside. A TOWN CAR
          exits, leaving Ryan in front of the house. RYAN, Aaron's
          younger brother is taller, more confident, and more successful.
          He moves slowly towards CAMERA and through the front doorway as
          CAMERA PULLS BACK with him.

                         RYAN
          Hello! Mom!

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Michelle, Aaron and Cynthia are on the couch as Ryan enters the
          living room.

                         CYNTHIA
          Ryan!
          Cynthia runs over to Ryan and flings her arms around him. Aaron
          looks a bit lost in the background with Michelle but they walk
          over.

                         RYAN
          I know this is hard, Mom. But you're
          going to be okay.

                         CYNTHIA
          You always know exactly what to say,
          Ryan. I'm so glad you're here.

                         RYAN

          Ryan turns to Aaron and Michelle.

                         RYAN
          Aaron, how are you?

                         AARON
          I'm alright.

          How was the flight?

                         RYAN
          Okay. I had to buy the seat next to
          me because I don't trust the airlines
          with my bags. And there was a lot of
          turbulence... I guess that's the
          thing about flying first class. It
          doesn't matter how much you pay if the
          plane crashes, you still end up dead--
          uh...
          Ryan realizes what he's said and stops speaking abruptly. It's
          too much for Cynthia who rushes upstairs.

                         AARON
          "End up dead"?

                         RYAN
          Oh damn.

                         MICHELLE
          I'll make sure she's okay.
          Michelle heads off upstairs.

          We see Norman's car turn into "Lakeview Retirement Community."
          He drives past the sign and through a gate.

          INT. NORMAN'S CAR/EXT. LAKEVIEW - DAY

          Norman is driving behind three OLD LADIES on mobile chairs.
          He's honking at them. He finally sees Uncle Russell.

          UNCLE RUSSELL, an elderly man in a wheelchair, sits in his
          chair.
          Norman drives forward and stops alongside the old man. He rolls
          down his window and speaks very slowly with a huge smile on his
          face.

                         NORMAN

                         (OVER ENUNCIATING)
          Hello, Uncle Russell. How are you?
          We're here to take you to the funeral.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Where the fuck have you been, you fat
          bastard? You're late. If you took
          any longer I'd be dead, too.
          The fake smile falls off Norman's face.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Ryan sees the coffin and slowly heads over with Aaron trailing
          behind. He stands over the coffin. It finally registers that
          his DAD is actually in there.

                         RYAN
          It's hard to see Dad like this. But
          he's in a better place now.

                         AARON
          When does dead beat sick?

                         RYAN
          I guess you're right. This is why I
          try not to get close to people.
          There's too much emotion involved.

                         AARON
          Well that explains why you never call.

                         RYAN
          What do you want me to say? Some
          families talk to each other all the
          time, some just see each other at
          funerals. That's us.

                         AARON

           By the way, I'm going to need that
           money.

          What money?

                         AARON
          The money for all this... the funeral.
          You're supposed to pay half.

          What about the insurance?

                         AARON

          So, poor old Uncle Eddie...

                         ELAINE
          Yeah. But he was sick for so long.

          I love when you come to family
          functions, Oscar. Because then Dad
          focuses all his hate on you.
           There's no response from Oscar. He looks distantly out the
          window. The pills are starting to kick in.

          Uncle Russell is asleep in the back. Norman is looking for a
          parking space, but the street and long driveway are packed with
          cars. A catering truck and flower van are taking up a lot of
          space.

                         NORMAN
          There's nowhere to park.
          Then the small flower delivery van pulls out. Derek points out
          the newly empty space.

          Just as he's about to drive in, another car takes it.

          Aw, damn. I have Uncle Russell. How
          could I forget about Uncle Russell?

          Stop the car. I have to speak with
          her. I have to speak with Elaine.
          Norman reluctantly stops the car. Derek gets out.

                         NORMAN
          What about Uncle Russell? I need help
          with Uncle Russell!
          It's too late. Derek is gone. The van in front of Norman honks
          the horn.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          What's going on here? Where are we?!
          We're going to be late!
          Russell hits him on the arm with his cane.

                         NORMAN
          Ow! Can you please stop doing that?!
          The van keeps beeping. Norman backs up.

                         (TO MOURNER)
          Nice to see you again.
          The mourner shakes hands with Ryan then walks away.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
          Who are all these people? I don't
          even recognize half of them.

                         AARON
          It's your family. You don't recognize
          them from the last funeral?
          Ryan looks around the room.

                         RYAN
          So what side of the family is he on?

                         AARON
          Who?

                         RYAN
          The guy in the leather jacket.
          Ryan looks around the room and sees a FOUR FOOT SIX MAN (FRANK)
          approaching the coffin.

                         AARON
          I have no idea. Maybe a friend of
          Dad's from work or something.
          Aaron turns to Ryan.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          So, you're telling me I'm going to
          have to pay for the whole funeral?

                         RYAN
          No I'm telling you you'll have the
          money in a few months when I get my
          advance.

                         AARON
          I'm not a God damn credit agency!
          REVEREND DAVIS, a very calm, serene woman, suddenly appears.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Aaron, how are you?

                         (CONTINUED)

                         AARON
          Yes, um... We're just waiting for
          everyone to arrive, then we can get
          going. I know you're in a hurry.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Yes, I have two more funerals and a
          Christening. I don't know what it is
          about the Spring, but they're either
          coming in or going out.
          She laughs, but Aaron and Ryan just look at her. Reverend Davis
          stands there waiting to be introduced to Ryan.

                         AARON
          Have you met my brother, Ryan?

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Ah, the writer, of course. I must
          admit I squeezed this job in because I
          wanted to meet you. I'm reading
          "Mama's Secret" right now. Don't tell
          anybody, I'm not supposed to be
          reading that kind of stuff.

                         RYAN
          I'm sure the Lord will forgive you.
          Aaron is irritated.

                         REVEREND DAVIS

                         (TO AARON)
          You must be very proud of your big
          brother. He really made something of
          his life.

                         (TO RYAN)
          I can't wait to hear your eulogy.

                         AARON
          No, no, I'm doing the eulogy.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Oh. I thought...

                         RYAN
          Aaron is the oldest.
          The reverend tries her best not to look disappointed.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Great... Well, I'll just make sure
          have everything I need.

          She looks at the coffin and then at the Bible in her hands.

          REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
          We've got a body and a Bible. Well,
          I'm all set.
          She walks off.

                         AARON
          Look, I think you should do the
          eulogy. Everyone's expecting you to
          do it.

                         RYAN
          No, they're not. You're the oldest.
          You should do it.

                         AARON
          Look most of the people are here for
          Dad, but let's not kid ourselves. A
          lot of them are here to hear your
          eulogy.

                         RYAN
          So imagine how surprised they'll be
          when they hear yours.
          Ryan walks away.

          Cynthia is helping prepare the food to go.out. Michelle is in
          the background at the sink. DUNCAN, Cynthia's brother, a middle
          aged doctor, approaches.

                         DUNCAN
          How's my little sister?

                         CYNTHIA
          I'm trying to hold it together,
          Duncan. He was a really good husband.
          My friends always told me about the
          crap their husbands put them through.
          I never had to deal with any of that.
          Remember when Uncle Matt got that
          nanny pregnant?

                         DUNCAN
          That was horrible.

          Michelle cringes in the background.

                         (TO CYNTHIA)
          I'll make you a cup of coffee,
          Cynthia.

                         CYNTHIA
          Coffee can do many things Michelle,
          but it can't bring back the dead.

          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Aaron finds a quiet place in the hallway and pulls out his
          notes.

                         MICHELLE
          Honey, we still need to finish that
          thing. Remember today is the last
          day.

                         AARON
          Can we talk about this when there's a
          little less death in the air?

                         MICHELLE
          No. No we can't.

                         AARON
          Honey, I'm just not in the mood...

                         MICHELLE

          It's my father's funeral.

                         MICHELLE
          I'm just trying to help you out. I'll
          put them back on before the service
          starts. Now come on.
          They turn. Aaron looks around the corner into the living room
          and sees the four foot six man standing by a table. Aaron stops
          Michelle.

                         AARON
          Babe, don't make it obvious, but that
          guy in the leather jacket standing by
          the wall. Don't look. Don't look.
          Don't look.
          Michelle catches a glimpse of the guy.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Do you recognize him?

                         MICHELLE
          Isn't that the guy from the Home
          Depot?

          No, I don't think so. Don't look.
          Don't look.

                         MICHELLE
          Did he put in the cable?

                         AARON
          No, no, that's not it. He keeps
          looking at me. Don't look. Don't
          look.

                         MICHELLE
          He's probably just a friend of your
          father's. I'll meet you in the
          garage. We have a few minutes before
          Uncle Russell gets here.
          Michelle walks off. Aaron peeks around the corner again and
          makes eye contact with the four foot six inch man, who seems to
          be staring straight at him. Aaron averts his eyes and heads
          off.

          Norman parks the car and gets out. He goes to the trunk and
          removes the wheelchair.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          What are you doing?! Be careful with
          that.
          Uncle Russell bangs his cane on the floor impatiently.

          UNCLE RUSSELL (CONT'D)
          Hurry up, we're late.
          Norman slams the trunk closed.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Aaron tries to get across the room as Michelle heads into the

          Oh, Ryan can you keep an eye out--

                         RYAN
          God damn, that Martina has grown up.
          ANGLE ON: MARTINA, nineteen and attractive.

                         AARON
          Are you talking about Little Martina?

                         RYAN
          She was like a teenager when I left,
          and now she's... you know. She's like
          damn.
          Aaron looks distastefully at his brother.

                         AARON
          Can you keep an eye out for Uncle
          Russell?

                         RYAN
          I think I should go see how she's
          been.

                         AARON
          Yeah, why don't you do that? See if
          she wants a juice box.

          FRANK (O.S.)
          Hi there.
          Aaron turns and finds himself cornered by Frank.

                         AARON
          Hello.

                         FRANK
          I was really sorry to hear about your
          dad. He talked about you a lot. I
          saw your wedding pictures. Your
          wife's dress was very beautiful.
          Aaron is a little uncomfortable.

                         AARON
          Uh... thanks.

                         MAN
          Did he ever mention me?... Frank?
          Frank steps forward and holds out his hand. Aaron shakes it.

                         AARON
          Frank?... I don't think so, no...
          Were you a friend of his?

                         FRANK
          Something like that, yeah.
          Michelle sticks her head out of the kitchen.

                         MICHELLE
          Honey. Can I see you for a moment?

                         AARON
          Well, nice to meet you. Thanks for

          INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Aaron has almost made it across the room when he is intercepted
          by Reverend Davis.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          I think we should get started.
          really have to leave at three.

                         AARON
          Sure. Can we just wait five minutes
          for my Uncle Russell? We can't start
          without him.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          .Of course.

          I'm so sorry to hear about your uncle.
          But he's in a better place now. I
          hear Ryan is doing the eulogy.
          Oscar, carrying a leaf, interrupts the conversation.

                         OSCAR
          Look... Isn't it beautiful?
          He wanders off again. Elaine doesn't know what the hell is
          going on.

          I have to tell you something and, I'm
          warning you in advance, you're not
          going to like it.
          Elaine looks at Jeff concerned.

          Aaron is intercepted again by Duncan who is talking to Ryan.

                         DUNCAN
          Aaron. How are we doing on time?

                         AARON
          As soon as Uncle Russell gets here
          we'll be ready to start.

                         DUNCAN
          So what's this I hear about Ryan not
          doing the eulogy?

                         RYAN
          I was just telling him how much I'm
          looking forward to hearing your
          eulogy.

                         DUNCAN
          That's a shame. I mean, I'm sure
          you'll be good, Aaron. It's just with
          Ryan being the writer of the family...

                         AARON
          Yeah.

                         DUNCAN
          There are people here that don't even
          know your father. They just came to
          hear Ryan.

                         AARON
          Would you excuse me?
          Aaron walks away.

                         DUNCAN

                         (TO RYAN)
          So any new books coming out? I just
          finished "Black Hurt.

          Aaron closes the door behind him. Michelle is waiting. They
          start kissing and pulling at each other's clothes. Aaron stops
          and leans on the door and sighs.

                         MICHELLE
          Are you alright?

                         AARON
          Every single person wants Ryan to do
          the eulogy. He was my father, too.
          I'm supposed to do the damn eulogy!
          I'm the oldest. Where was Ryan when I
          was taking care of Dad?

                         MICHELLE
          Calm down. Calm down. Forget about
          everyone. You're going to do the
          eulogy and it's going to be the best
          eulogy anyone's every heard. Now
          could you please do me a favor and get
          me pregnant?

                         AARON
          Come on, do I have to do this today?

                         MICHELLE
          Yes. What do you want? You want me
          to talk dirty? I'm gonna suck it.
          I'm gonna to suck it.
          Before Michelle can continue her PG rated dirty talk, there is a
          knock on the door.

                         MAN
          Is there more soda in here?

                         AARON
          Yes! Come in!
          Michelle is frustrated.

          Elaine is looking at Jeff in absolute shock.

                         ELAINE
          What do you mean it's not Valium?

                         JEFF
          I mean what you thought was Valium,
          wasn't actually Valium. It's a
          hallucinogenic. Like, acid,
          mescaline... Special K...
          Oscar moves in the background behind Elaine and Jeff. Elaine
          looks at him. He's making strange contorted expressions with
          his face and pointing at the sky. Other people are starting to
          notice him and think he's slightly odd.

                         ELAINE
          This isn't funny, Jeff.

                         JEFF
          I'm not being funny. Look at him,
          he's high as a kite!
          Oscar sticks his head into a huge bush.

                         ELAINE
          What the hell are you doing leaving
          that stuff around your house?!

                         JEFF
          A friend left it. And who the hell
          just goes into someone's house and
          takes pills?

                         ELAINE
          I thought they were Valium!
          (takes a deep breath)
          What am I supposed to do? Should I
          tell him?

                         JEFF
          No, don't do that. It'll just freak
          him out... We'll just keep a close
          eye on him, and make sure he doesn't
          get out of control... And don't let
          him spend too long talking to one
          person... or bush.
          Oscar wanders into the front door. Elaine quickly follows him.
          Jeff reluctantly follows Elaine. Derek arrives in time to see
          this and follows as well.

          Not bad considering we're at a
          funeral.
          Jeff steps forward.

                         JEFF
          Hi, Dad.
          He shakes his hand.

                         DUNCAN
          How's Pepperdine treating you? Is
          Professor Clarke still giving you a
          hard time?

                         JEFF
          No, no. It's all worked out. Don't
          worry.

                         DUNCAN
          I'm not worried about you.
          Duncan looks pointedly at Elaine, irritating her. Duncan looks
          at Oscar who is in the background.

                         DUNCAN (CONT'D)
          So I see you brought your friend.

                         ELAINE
          He's my boyfriend. And you know his
          name.
          Derek approaches.

          Doctor, how nice to see you again.

          hospital?

                         DEREK
          Great. Great. We should have lunch
          soon. I'd love to hear what you think

          to join us for lunch?
          They both look expectantly at Elaine who looks away disgusted.
          Cynthia comes up to them and kisses Elaine and Jeff hello.
          Oscar stares at her.

                         CYNTHIA
          Elaine... Jeff... good to see you.

                         ELAINE
          I'm so sorry, Auntie. We're going to
          miss Uncle Edward so much.

                         JEFF
          Yeah. He was a great guy.

                         CYNTHIA
          Thank you.

                         OSCAR
          I'm so sorry about... the death...
          He sings "Amazing Grace" softly as Duncan, Derek, Jeff and
          Elaine look on.

                         OSCAR (CONT'D)
          Amazing Grace / How sweet the sound /
          That saved a wretch like me...
          Cynthia untangles herself from Oscar. She heads back outside.
          Duncan gives Elaine a look, then heads off after Cynthia.

                         JEFF
          What are you going to do?

                         ELAINE
          I don't know. I can't leave. Aunt
          Cynthia would never speak to me again.
          Jeff notices that Oscar has left. He rushes outside. Elaine
          follows. Derek follows suit.

          Then comes Elaine.
          Jeff approaches Oscar and stands with him as Elaine watches from
          the doorway. Derek walks up.

                         DEREK
          You look nice, Elaine.

                         ELAINE
          I'm dressed for a funeral.

                         DEREK
          Yeah, but you make death look sexy.
          She looks at him.

                         DEREK (CONT'D)
          So, I heard about the engagement.

                         ELAINE
          Hey, hey. I don't really have time to
          deal with whatever happened between
          you and me. But I have not told my
          dad yet, so I would appreciate it if
          you would keep your mouth shut.

                         DEREK
          Sure. Anything for you.
          Derek looks over and notices Oscar looking bewildered.

                         DEREK (CONT'D)
          So that's him? That's the man you're
          going to spend the rest of your life
          with?
          Elaine looks over at the drugged up Oscar. Oscar leans over
          like he's on a nod. Jeff leans down with him, watching. Right
          before Oscar falls over, he comes up really fast.- Then he
          starts walking.

                         ELAINE
          Yep, that's him.
          Oscar who has been walking in circles with a look of awe on his
          face, changes direction and flies by Elaine and Derek back into
          the house with Jeff in tow.

          Norman pushes Russell up the stairs close to where Derek is
          standing. He looks like he's about to collapse from exhaustion.
          Norman lets go of the wheelchair and catches his breath. Derek
          grabs the chair blocking Norman from view just as Aaron arrives.

          Ladies and gentlemen, could you all
          kindly take your seats? We're about
          to begin the service.
          Ryan helps Martina to her seat. Jeff keeps an eye on Oscar.
          Elaine grabs Oscar and drags him to a seat. Aaron wheels Uncle
          Russell to his place.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Move! Move!
          He pokes people with his cane. Aaron then takes his seat with
          Michelle.
          Oscar is not looking so good.
          Ryan finally ends the conversation with Martina and heads to his
          seat.
          Reverend Davis is about to start, but waits as Norman, sweating,
          pushes through the crowd to his seat. The reverend waits for
          the disturbance to end, so Norman attracts the attention of
          everyone. Norman takes his seat next to Derek. Derek leans
          away.

          Family and friends, we're gathered
          here today to mourn the passing of
          Edward Barnes.

                         NORMAN
          Yeah, well, you left me to push Uncle
          Russell up that damn hill all by
          myself. Then took all the credit.

          Elaine turns back around. Norman is irritated by this.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          I'd like to start with a favorite
          passage of Edwards from First Samuel
          chapter 18, verses 1-4 in the King
          James Bible.

                         (READING)
          "And it came to pass, when he had made
          an end of speaking unto Saul, that the
          soul of Jonathan was knit with the
          soul of David, and Jonathan loved him
          as his own soul. And Saul took him
          that day, and would let him go no more
          home to his father's house..."
          While the reverend is talking, Norman pokes Elaine on the
          shoulder and leans forward.

                         NORMAN

          I'm part of the family--

                         ELAINE
          'Cause you're not.

                         NORMAN

                         (WHISPERS)
          .but when you dissed me back there,
          I had Uncle Russell in the car.
          Aaron, disturbed by Norman's whispering, looks over.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERS)
          You stole my parking space, and I had
          to push him half a mile up a hill. We
          almost missed the service!
          Aaronlooks over again.

                         ELAINE

                         (WHISPERS)
          Look, Norman, if you poke me one more
          time, I'm going to kick your ass.

          What the hell is going on?!

                         (WHISPERS)
          She stole my parking space!

                         AARON
          (whispers to Norman)
          Stole your parking space?!. My
          father's dead! Act right.
          Reverend Davis looks at them then continues her speech.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          ."Then Jonathan and David made a
          covenant, because he loved him as his
          own soul..."
          As she speaks, Norman looks at his wrist, worried. The woman
          sitting next to him smacks his wrist down.
          ANGLE ON: Elaine looks at Jeff who watches Oscar. Oscar is
          fidgeting and looking worried.
          ANGLE ON: Aaron and Michelle. Aaron looks worried.

          REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
          ."And Jonathan stripped himself of
          the robe that was upon him, and gave
          it to David, and his garments, even to
          his sword and to his bow, and to his
          girdle."
          ANGLE ON: Oscar is laughing. Elaine tries to control him.

          REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
          And now we'll have a few words from
          Edward's son, Aaron. Ryan's older
          brother.
          ANGLE ON: Aaron as he gathers himself. Michelle gives Aaron a
          supportive squeeze of the arm. Aaron looks over and sees Frank
          staring at him.
          ANGLE ON: Uncle Russell.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Why isn't Ryan doing the eulogy? This
          is bullshit.

          Aaron arrives at the front and looks out across the expectant
          crowd. He's extremely nervous.

                         AARON
          Good afternoon, everyone.
          (his voice cracks)
          Thank you for coming... I never
          realized Dad was so popular. It looks
          like he's got more friends now that
          he's dead.
          Blank faces stare back at Aaron. Cynthia looks pained.
          Everyone is silent except for Oscar who laughs loudly. Elaine
          silences him with a look. Aaron composes himself and pulls his
          notes out.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          My father was an exceptional man... He
          was born in 1938. He grew up in
          Alabama on a farm. He loved to take
          long walks in the woods with his close
          friend, Bobby. He told me how they
          spent their summer days riding their
          bikes through the fields and swimming
          in the lake.
          As Aaron speaks, Reverend Davis looks concerned because the
          eulogy is so bad. She looks to Ryan who looks like "what can I
          do?"
          Jeff looks more concerned with Oscar, whose face is contorted
          with pain. He looks like he's going to burst.
          ANGLE ON: Aaron.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Dad's first job was working after
          school as an assistant to an
          electrician named Mr. Thompson. Back
          then, Blacks weren't allowed to wear
          rubber gloves. So my father got
          shocked a lot. Because of that, he
          had no feeling in his fingertips. I
          asked my Dad what his first boss was
          like...
          The drugs have gotten the best of Oscar. He suddenly grabs
          Elaine's arm. Aaron keeps talking.

                         OSCAR
          Did you just see that?

          See what?

                         OSCAR
          The coffin just moved.

                         ELAINE
          What?

                         OSCAR
          I'm telling you I saw it move.
          Aaron becomes vaguely aware of the disturbance, but battles on
          with his eulogy.

                         AARON
          .He said he was a nice man, and
          surprisingly well dressed. When Dad
          was eighteen, he left home after an
          argument with his father. He never
          told me what that argument was about,
          but I do know that after leaving South
          Carolina, sadly he and Bob lost touch
          and never saw each other again. Dad
          went to college where he studied
          accounting, a decision which lead to a
          career in corporate finance... But
          his real passion was for the arts,
          with a particular fondness for
          theatre, dance and musicals. He was a
          charter member of the Negro Ensemble
          Company and contributed regularly to
          the Alvin Ailey School of Dance.
          Oscar's protests are getting louder. Duncan looks back at the
          disruption with a disapproving glare. Elaine looks at Jeff who
          watches, concerned.

                         OSCAR
          There, look. It happened again.

                         ELAINE
          Oscar, please-
          People start looking at Oscar, who's becoming increasingly
          vocal, and looking increasingly like someone on acid.

                         OSCAR
          That coffin's moving!

                         (SHOUTS)
          The coffin's moving!
          Michelle looks worried. Cynthia watches silently. Oscar jumps
          up. Aaron stops the eulogy. Elaine is about to die from
          embarrassment.

                         OSCAR (CONT'D)
          There's someone alive in there!

                         ELAINE
          Oscar, please sit down.
          Oscar ignores her and walks purposefully towards the coffin.
          People watch him in astonishment, including Jeff.

                         OSCAR
          What the hell is wrong with you
          people?!
          Oscar approaches the coffin as Aaron steps off the dais. Elaine
          tries to hold Oscar back, but she can't.

                         ELAINE

                         (PANICKED)
          Oscar, where are you going?

                         AARON
          What are you doing?

                         OSCAR
          There's someone moving in there.
          Can't you see?
          Oscar tries to open the coffin. Aaron and Elaine try to
          restrain him, but can't. A tussle begins. Ryan jumps in to
          help.

                         RYAN
          What the hell is wrong with you?!

          Get away from there!

                         OSCAR
          No, I have to show you! He's alive!
          He's alive!
          The scene descends into absolute chaos with people pushing and
          struggling. Finally, the coffin falls off the platform and tips
          over.
          The dead body of Edward rolls out onto the floor at the feet of
          Cynthia. Cynthia screams.
          Aaron freezes in shock. Michelle takes Cynthia through the
          kitchen. The living room is left in chaos.

          EXT. BACK GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

          Elaine drags Oscar out the back. Jeff follows.

          INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

          Cynthia, in tears, enters accompanied by Aaron, Michelle and
          Reverend Davis.

                         MICHELLE
          It's alright, Cynthia. It's alright.
          She sits in a chair crying uncontrollably. Aaron is so angry,
          he just marches out.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Some MEN grab the body and put it back in the coffin. Aaron
          comes out of the kitchen and heads to the back yard. As they
          put the coffin back on the stand, Ryan addresses the crowd.

                         RYAN
          Please let me extend my apologies to
          you all. I understand the incident
          you just witnessed was quite shocking,
          but everything will be... returned...
          to it's proper place. Please enjoy

          Aaron exits through the garden door.

          EXT. BACK GARDEN - DAY

          Aaron storms out to Elaine who is trying to comfort Oscar. He's
          looking very disturbed. Jeff is also there, looking guilty.

                         AARON
          Elaine, what the hell was that?!

                         ELAINE
          I'm so sorry, Aaron.

                         AARON
          Oh, okay. My dead father's sprawled
          out on the living room floor, but it's
          okay, you're sorry.

                         OSCAR
          But the coffin was moving.

          Please, Aaron. Go back inside. I'll
          explain later.

          He goes inside leaving Michelle standing there. Duncan comes

          Dad, leave it alone!

                         DUNCAN
          Leave it alone?! He just knocked my
          brother-in-law out of his coffin.

                         ELAINE
          It wasn't his fault.

          Yes it was. My sister is in tears. I
          can't believe you brought this idiot!
          I don't ever want to see him again, do
          you understand me?

                         ELAINE
          I can't do that.

                         DUNCAN
          Why not?

                         ELAINE
          Because we're... moving in together.
          Duncan looks over at Oscar, who looks like he's just seen a
          ghost. He's struggling to stand up straight, with Jeff who's
          doing his best to look after him.

          Are you crazy?

          Dad, this isn't actually what he's
          like. He took some drugs and--

                         ELAINE
          No he's not on the pipe. He took some
          Valium and had a.bad reaction.
          Jeff looks grateful.

                         DUNCAN
          Valium?! That's not a Valium high.
          Your mother was on Valium for forty
          years. She never knocked over a
          coffin.

                         ELAINE
          Dad, please.

                         DUNCAN
          I just want to point out that you
          won't see Derek knocking over a
          coffin.

          Not right now, Dad.

          Fine. I've got to check on Cynthia,
          but this isn't over.
          Duncan walks back to the house. Elaine walks over to Oscar who

          Aaron talks to a mourner. Norman comes up and hugs him.

                         NORMAN
          Are you alright?... That was insane.
          He just fell out the coffin like a
          dead fish. I guess its not much of a
          metaphor when you're talking about a
          dead human, but--

          Norman, please.

                         NORMAN
          Oh yeah... Sorry. It's just that you
          never know when it's your time. Like,
          I have this weird thing on my wrist.
          I've had it for a few weeks now. I
          don't know what it is--

                         AARON
          Why don't you show it to my Uncle
          Duncan? He's a doctor.

                         NORMAN
          He is? Great. Thanks.
          Norman walks off toward the kitchen. He passes Uncle Russell
          and Ryan talking to Martina.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          I read your last book, "Black Hurt."

                         RYAN
          Good, good. Thanks a lot.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          I'm not giving you a compliment you
          arrogant bastard. What a load of
          bullshit. I wouldn't wipe my ass with
          it.
          Ryan leads Martina away from Uncle Russell.

          Oscar, Elaine and Jeff are standing together.

                         OSCAR
          I swear it was moving. I must be
          losing my mind...
          (looks at his hands)
          Why are my hands so big?!

          Oscar, listen to me. I need to tell
          you something...

          Now... You remember I gave you some
          Valium earlier?

                         OSCAR
          Yes.

                         ELAINE
          Well it turns out that it wasn't
          actually Valium.
          Oscar just looks at Elaine. Jeff slinks off into the
          background.

                         ELAINE (CONT'D)

          Hello?

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          Cynthia is being comforted by her friends and Duncan. Norman
          enters and beckons Duncan over to the side.

                         NORMAN
          Hello, Doctor, I know this is a bad
          time, but I've got this thing on my
          hand. I've had it for weeks now...
          Duncan is looking at Norman incredulously.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          What do you think it is?
          Cynthia stands up.

                         CYNTHIA
          Duncan, I'm going back now.
          She exits. Reluctantly, Duncan answers Norman.

                         DUNCAN
          You should probably go see a
          dermatologist.
          He turns to follow his sister out, but Norman pulls him back.

          is?

          I don't know. It looks like some kind
          of pigment mutation.
          Duncan walks further out of the room.

                         NORMAN
          Pigment mutation?!
          Duncan turns again.

                         DUNCAN
          You're probably just allergic to
          something. Maybe from shellfish,
          nuts...
          Duncan heads further out of the room, but Norman won't give up.

                         NORMAN
          Nuts? What kind of nuts?
          Duncan turns around again.

                         DUNCAN
          I don't know. Pecans? Peanuts?...
          Excuse me.
          Duncan finally exits, leaving Norman looking shocked and
          terrified.

          Elaine is trying to explain to Oscar.

                         ELAINE
          Do you understand? Hallucinogenic.
          Oscar recoils. He turns to Jeff.

                         JEFF
          Yeah, now, the best thing to do is
          relax and just go with the flow. Try
          and enjoy it.

          Oscar stands up, panicked and grabs Jeff by the lapels. We see
          the bottle of "Valium" falls out of his pocket.

          Oh, hi, Elaine. You following me?
          She just runs right past, then Jeff rushes past following

          Okay. Breathe.

                         (HE DOES)
          It's going to be okay. Breathe.
          You're and investment banker. You've
          handled mergers for billion dollar
          companies. You can do this. Dead
          bodies don't move. They don't move.
          But that body was moving. It was
          moving.
          Then he slaps himself.

          Snap out of it! You can handle this.
          You can do this.

          Alright. You're okay. Stay calm...
          Stay calm...
          Oscar is still staring at himself in the mirror.

          That's it, Oscar, keep it together.
          K.I.T. Keep it together. K.I.T.
          Keep it together. Everything's going
          to be fine. Nothing moved. Dead

          Frank takes out his glasses and notices a manuscript on the desk

          Actually I'm the oldest. I was

          pieces published in the New Yorker.
          But now I'm mainly teaching.

          Your father and I were very... close.

          Yeah. Okay. That's good.

                         FRANK
          And we spent a lot of time together.

                         AARON
          Yeah, well Dad was a fun guy.
          Frank takes an envelope out of his inside jacket pocket and
          takes some photos from the envelope.

                         FRANK
          Um... I've got some photos I want to
          show you.

                         AARON
          Sure.
          Frank passes the first photo.

                         FRANK
          That's me and your Dad in Central Park
          in New York.
          Aaron looks at the photo curiously.

                         FRANK (CONT'D)
          That's us on Santa Monica Boulevard on
          Halloween...
          Aaron takes the next one, becoming more suspicious.

                         AARON
          So, where did you and my dad meet?

                         FRANK
          Just around.

          INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

          Elaine is outside the bathroom banging on the door. We can
          still hear Oscar moaning inside.

                         ELAINE
          Oscar. Are you alright?

          INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME

          Oscar is laying in the bathtub. He has his head under the
          faucet with his mouth open. A drip falls into his mouth.

                         OSCAR
          Ahhh.
          He smacks his lips together and then opens his mouth and waits
          for the next drop.

          INT. STUDY - DAY

          Aaron is sitting with Frank. Frank passes him another photo.

                         FRANK
          That's one of me and your father going
          to the premiere of "Dreamgirls". I
          was dressed as Deena and your father
          had to be Effie.
          Aaron looks at the photo of them dressed in drag.

                         (CONTINUED)

          So... I mean you have all these
          pictures, but he never said anything
          about you. This is the first I'm

                         SEEING OF--
          Frank gives Aaron a knowing look.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          How did you know my father?
          Aaron looks around the room. There is a copy of "People
          Magazine" sexiest men issue on the table. He sees figurines of
          male ballet dancers. It's getting clearer. He sees three
          Robert Mapplethorpe photos on the wall. There's a signed Kathy
          Griffin 8x10. Frank looks around waiting for him to get it.
          Aaron looks at a framed movie poster for Australia with Hugh
          Jackman. Aaron looks back at the picture. He gets it.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Oh God...
          Aaron jumps up and closes the study door.

                         FRANK
          Are you really that shocked?
          Frank gestures around the room.

                         AARON
          I had no idea.

                         FRANK
          I'm sorry. I'm sure he would have
          eventually told you, but I guess he
          wasn't sure how you'd react.
          Aaron shakes in disgust.

                         AARON
          Uugg. Like this.
          Aaron gathers his senses. He has a thought and turns to Frank.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Does my mother know?

                         FRANK
          No. And there's no reason why she
          should... Just as long as I get
          what's owed to me.

          A long pause. Aaron looks over at Frank.

                         AARON
          "What's owed to you"?

          FRANK .
          Well, obviously I should get
          something... I mean, your dad and I
          were lovers, and he left me absolutely
          nothing in his will. How do you think
          that makes me feel?
          Aaron fails to respond, because he's in too much shock.

                         FRANK (CONT'D)
          I'll tell you how it makes me feel
          cheap. Like some cheap piece of
          ass... I mean, I'm entitled to
          something.

                         AARON
          What do you want?

                         FRANK
          What I want is a lot, but I'm not
          asking you for what I want. I deserve
          thirty thousand dollars.

                         AARON
          Thirty thousand dollars?! I can't
          just give you thirty thousand dollars.
          My wife and I are trying to have kids--

                         FRANK
          Your father told me you were having
          trouble...

                         (BEAT)
          Look, your father promised to take
          care of me, and I made sacrifices to
          keep him happy.
          Aaron gets angry.

                         AARON
          You think you can come in here,
          slander my father's name and show me a
          few photos of you and my dad dressed
          up going to see "Dreamgirls"? I saw
          "Dreamgirls" twice. I'm not gay.
          That's not proof of anything...

          I'm not giving you anything but a--
          Frank pulls out another photo and holds it up to Aaron's face.
          Aaron,releases Frank and snatches the picture.

                         FRANK
          Now I don't want to, but I will show
          these photos to your mother... Do you
          really want me to do that today?

                         AARON
          Wait here.
          He exits the study.

          INT. ENTRY CORRIDOR - DAY

          Aaron closes the study door behind him and almost bumps into two
          male mourners.

          MIDDLE AGED MAN
          Aaron, I was just telling George here
          how when we were boys together your
          dad used to love to make us all go
          skinny dipping.
          Aaron just stares at them. Then he moves toward the living
          room.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - BUFFET - DAY

          Aaron crosses the living room which is full of people mingling
          around. He's gone pale.

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Oh God, oh God, oh God...

          I guess you've got it under control.

          Get away from me.
          Derek gets up and walks off, leaving Norman spitting out the
          cake.
          From under the table, Jeff pops up.

                         JEFF
          You haven't seen a pill bottle around,
          have you? A Valium pill bottle?

                         NORMAN
          No. But can you try this--
          Jeff smiles nervously and goes back to his search on the floor.
          Jeff slides across the floor past Uncle Russell sitting at the
          other end of the table. An OLDER LADY turns to Russell.

                         OLDER LADY
          Edward and I watched the Tony Awards
          every year. We would get all dressed
          up and sip cocktails. I'm going to
          miss him so much.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Don't worry. The way you look, you
          won't be far behind.
          The mourner looks shocked. Jeff continues his search along the
          floor.

          Cynthia is sitting quietly with Duncan.

                         DUNCAN
          I'm sure we'll start soon.
          He looks toward the house and sees Norman exit. Duncan wants to
          avoid him.

                         DUNCAN (CONT'D)

                         (TO CYNTHIA)
          Let's go inside.

                         CYNTHIA
          In a moment.
          Duncan gets up and heads toward the house. He passes Norman.

                         NORMAN
          Doctor, I just have a--
          Duncan doesn't stop, leaving Norman holding his wrist. Norman
          looks over and sees Cynthia. He sits next to her.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry... you know... about... you
          know...

                         CYNTHIA
          Thank you. I'll be alright. I know
          he's watching over me.

                         NORMAN
          You think so?' I mean, there are a lot
          of fine ones up in heaven. Anna
          Nicole Smith's dead too, you know.
          might be watching over her.
          Norman sits next to Cynthia.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          Death is a terrible thing... Did you
          check to make sure he.was wearing
          shoes? I hear they steal the shoes.
          And I hope you took off his ring,
          'cause if it's worth anything, someone
          is going to take that, too.
          Cynthia stares at Norman.

          Before he died, did he have a rash?
          She gets up and exits. Norman notices Jeff's pill bottle on the
          ground. He picks it up and puts it in his pocket.

          INT. KITCHEN - LATER

          The camera closes in on the closed garage door. We hear hushed
          voices.

          INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS


                         AARON
          You don't understand. If we don't
          give him the money, he's going to show
          Mom the picture.

                         RYAN
          Okay. Let me think, let me think.
          Ryan is trying to come up with a solution.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
          I think you should pay him the money.

                         AARON
          What do you mean, you think I should
          pay him the money? Where the hell is
          all your money?

                         RYAN
          I'm in debt up to my ass. I'm broke,
          man!

                         AARON
          So after paying for the funeral, the
          clothes, the catering... Now I'm
          supposed to shell out thirty thousand
          dollars? He's your father, too.

                         RYAN
          You're the oldest. Besides, you've
          been living off Mom and Dad long
          enough. You must have some money
          saved. You haven't paid rent in two
          years.

                         AARON
          I have not been living off of them...
          I've been living with them.

          No I haven't paid rent, but Dad hasn't
          worked in five years. Who do you
          think has been paying all the bills?

                         RYAN
          Well if you've got money problems and
          I've got money problems, what can we
          do? Fuck him!
          Aaron shows Ryan the photo again.

          You've got to pay him.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Uncle Russell is creating havoc at the buffet table. He's
          pushing people aside and poking them with his cane.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Are you alright?

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          No, my nephew is dead and these
          bastards ate all the potato salad.
          Nearby mourners look appalled. The reverend looks over and sees
          Aaron and Ryan coming down the kitchen corridor. She approaches
          them.

          Reverend Davis appears in front of Aaron and Ryan.

          Ah! I think we're just about ready to
          start the service, so-

          Would you mind giving us five minutes?

                         (NOT HAPPY)
          Of course.

                         AARON
          Thanks.
          Aaron walks off followed by Ryan. He passes Michelle, who's
          sitting on the couch. She stands up.

                         MICHELLE
          Is everything okay?

                         AARON
          No. I'm really sorry, honey, but

          Aaron walks off to join Ryan, who's at the door of the study.

          INT. STUDY - DAY

          Frank is reading Aaron's manuscript. Ryan and Aaron enter.

                         RYAN

                         (TO FRANK)
          You? So you and my--. You?! It's
          you. So when I called my father and
          he didn't answer, he was with you?!
          Aaron realizes what Frank is reading.

                         AARON
          Hey, hey, hey!
          Aaron rushes over and takes the manuscript away from Frank.

          What are you doing with my
          manuscript?! It's not ready.
          He puts it in the desk.

                         FRANK
          Well, you left it on a coffee table.

                         AARON
          What's that supposed to mean?

          Well, when you put things on coffee

          Fine by me.
          Aaron is now extremely irritated. He exchanges a look with Ryan
          confirming that there's no other way out.

          You give us the photos and stay away
          from our mother. Deal?

                         FRANK
          Deal.
          Aaron sits down at the desk and reluctantly takes out his check
          book. He starts writing.

          What?

                         FRANK
          The novel... it's a first draft?

          I tried writing once... Didn't work
          for me, either. I think it's just a
          gift. You either have it or you
          don't... It must be hard for you
          though, especially since your younger
          brother is such a great writer.

          There's a long pause as everyone seems to be deciding what to

                         FRANK
          Get off me!
          Ryan is trying to muffle Frank's screams.

                         RYAN
          Aaron, help me!
          Ryan is holding Frank down and trying to keep him quiet.

                         FRANK
          Ah!!

          Aaron, you got any rope or duct tape?

                         AARON
          What?! I'm not a serial killer. I
          don't keep rope and duct tape in my
          pocket.

                         RYAN
          Well just grab something!
          (indicating with his head)
          There, from the curtains.
          Aaron grabs the cord that's tied around the curtains. He holds
          it over the wrestling duo, but Ryan's hands are occupied with
          Frank.

                         RYAN (CONT'D)
          Tie his legs.
          Aaron grabs his legs and in doing so falls on top of Frank as
          well. As he wraps the curtain cord around Frank's legs...

                         AARON
          This is a really bad idea.

          INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY

          Elaine leans against the wall listening as Oscar hums in the
          bathroom. She slides down the wall and sits on the floor.

          EXT. BATHROOM WINDOW - SAME TIME

          From a rooftop POV we see the window slide open and Oscar,
          dripping with sweat and not wearing a shirt, lean out. He takes
          a deep breath of fresh air and listens to the birds.
          He climbs out the window revealing he's completely naked. He
          stands on-the roof and lifts his hands to the sky.

          INT. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

          Michelle comes up and sits next to Elaine.

          How would I know? He's been avoiding
          me all day. We're trying to get
          pregnant. But I can't really do that
          by myself, can I? I feel like I'm
          making him eat brussel sprouts every
          time we do it.
          Elaine looks at her.

                         ELAINE
          The guy's father just died. Don't you
          think this is a bad day for sex?

                         MICHELLE
          Don't you think I know that?

                         ELAINE
          I'm sorry. At least your husband
          didn't ruin the funeral.

                         MICHELLE
          It's a funeral, it's already ruined.
          When you start off with a dead guest
          of honor, how much worse can it get?

          INT. STUDY - DAY

          Ryan and Aaron struggle with Frank, who's muffled cries are
          starting to fade.

                         RYAN
          Get that tie.
          Aaron grabs the necktie from off the desk.

                         AARON
          What am I supposed to do with the tie?

                         RYAN
          Whatever you do with a tie.

                         AARON
          I don't know what to--

                         RYAN
          Just stuff it in his mouth! Damn,
          I have to do everything?

          Suddenly the door opens and Norman enters.

                         NORMAN
          Aaron, do you know what was in this
          cake, I-
          ANGLE ON: Frank who looks at Norman bug eyed hoping he'll help.

                         RYAN
          Shut the goddamn door!
          Shocked, Norman does as he's told. It takes Norman a moment to
          register that Aaron and Ryan are sitting on top of Frank.
          Frank continues screaming through the cloth.

                         NORMAN
          What is going on? Who is that guy?
          Ryan thinks quickly.

                         RYAN
          He's having a seizure.

                         NORMAN
          I just found some Valium outside.
          Would that help?

                         RYAN
          Yeah. Great. Give him some.
          Frank shakes his head "no." Norman gets on his knees with the
          guys and opens the bottle.

                         NORMAN
          It's okay. This should help. calm you
          down.
          Frank tries to protest, but can't. Ryan holds Frank's mouth
          open as Aaron holds his nose closed. Norman pours a few pills
          into Frank's mouth, then Ryan holds Frank's mouth shut.
          Suddenly the door opens again and Jeff walks in.

                         JEFF
          Have you seen a little brown pill
          bottle lying around--
          They all turn to Jeff. Frank looks at him, hoping this time
          he'll get saved.

                         NORMAN
          You said "shut the damn door."
          Jeff locks the door and looks shocked.

                         JEFF
          What's going on?

                         NORMAN
          He's having a seizure.

                         JEFF
          Why is he all tied up?
          No one knows what to say.

          Oscar stands on the roof, naked, breathing in the fresh air.

          INT. STUDY - DAY

          Jeff, Aaron, Ryan and Norman are all kneeling over Frank.

                         JEFF
          He's blackmailing you? Over what?

                         AARON
          If I could tell everybody, it wouldn't
          be blackmail.

          Look, just trust us. He's the bad
          guy. We'll explain later.

          They all head over to Jeff.
          Frank looks extremely curious to know what's going on. Everyone
          talks very quietly so that Frank can't hear.

                         JEFF
          The thing is... those pills aren't
          really Valium. It's acid and... acid.

          They all turn and look at Frank who is looking back at them,
          increasingly concerned by whatever conversation they are having,
          and the pitying expressions on their faces.

          Maybe we should call an ambulance.

          You can't do that. I'll go to jail.

          He's right. If anyone finds out this
          guy's been force fed acid, we could

          No such thing as having a woman

          something about women. Smarter than
          you think they are. But not as smart
          as they think they are.

                         DEREK
          She acts like she doesn't care that I
          exist. I mean how can she not feel
          what I feel?

                         UNCLE RUSSELL

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh she feels it. She's playing hard
          to get. She wants you to work for it.
          Look, let me tell something about
          women. They want a man who can
          control them. I know they talk all
          this Oprah, Beyonce "single women" BS,
          but what they really want is an old
          school man.

                         DEREK
          Really?

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Listen here, boy. This is what you
          do: you walk up to her, slap her--

                         DEREK
          Slap her? You want me to hit her?

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Has not hitting her worked? Look,
          then you grab her and kiss her. The
          harder the better.

                         DEREK
          Are you sure, 'cause that--

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Oh, man, I gotta shit. Where's the
          can?

          INT. STUDY - DAY

          Norman and Jeff are sitting in the study. Frank is on the floor
          tied up, breathing heavily and making gurgling sounds.

                         JEFF
          I can't believe you gave him five.
          Even if they were Valium, that's too
          many. I wouldn't give a guy five
          cough drops.
          Suddenly they hear the doorknob rattle. Norman and Jeff both
          look terrified.

                         FRANK

                         (MUFFLED)
          Hello?
          Jeff covers his mouth.

          UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)
          Hello?!
          Neither Norman nor Jeff want to speak. They argue in gestures.
          Finally Jeff relents.

                         JEFF
          Hello?

          UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)
          I need the toilet.
          Jeff and Norman both look panicked. Norman goes to the door.

          I'm in a wheelchair, you idiot! How
          am I supposed to get up the stairs?!

                         FRANK

                         (MUFFLED)
          Hello?
          Norman and Jeff look at each other not knowing what to do.

          UNCLE RUSSELL (O.S.)
          Open the damn door!
          Uncle Russell starts banging on the door with his cane.

                         NORMAN
          What are we going to do?
          They look at Frank who's starting to look high as a kite.

                         JEFF
          We'll stick him behind the couch.

                         NORMAN

                         (CALLS OUT)
          Just looking for the key.
          They pick Frank up and dump him behind the couch.
          Jeff stays with Frank to keep him quiet as Norman opens the
          door. Uncle Russell wheels himself inside.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          What the hell is wrong with you
          people? I'm about to take a dump in
          my pants!

          Elaine is still standing outside the bathroom.
          Derek comes up to talk to her. Elaine's completely drained and

                         DEREK
          The only reason you don't want to go
          out with me is because your dad likes
          me.

                         ELAINE
          No. The reason I don't want to go out
          with you is because it was a mistake.
          I was drunk off my ass. You could
          have been a donkey.

          Thanks.

                         ELAINE
          That wasn't a compliment. I'm saying
          I couldn't remember it.

                         DEREK
          Well I remember every minute of it.

                         ELAINE
          A minute, huh? That's why I don't
          remember.

                         DEREK
          What is it about this guy? What has
          he got that I haven't got?

                         ELAINE
          Okay, well for one thing, he's

          You just can't get over it, can you?
          You're burning with jealousy because I
          left and did what you always wanted to
          do.

                         AARON
          I couldn't leave because I had

          Don't put it off on responsibilities.

                         NORMAN
          Check him again. Check him.

                         JEFF
          Man. Hey. Hey!

                         NORMAN
          Wake him up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake
          up.

                         JEFF
          What's his name?

                         NORMAN
          I don't know. Try Larry.
          Jeff looks at Norman, but he doesn't have a better idea.

                         JEFF
          Larry?

                         NORMAN
          Shake him.
          Jeff bends down and shakes him.

                         JEFF
          Larry, wake up. It's time to get up.
          From the bathroom, Uncle Russell starts to stir. Norman quickly
          closes the door.

                         NORMAN
          Maybe it's not Larry. Try something
          else. Pinch him.
          Jeff pinches Frank. Still no response.

                         NORMAN (CONT'D)
          He must be breathing. He has to be
          breathing. Please God let him be
          breathing.

          Jeff looks concerned. He checks for a pulse. He looks up at
          Norman with an expression that tells us all we need to know.

                         JEFF
          He's dead.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Michelle walks into frame and stops at the coffin. Aaron and.
          Ryan stand on either side of her.

                         MICHELLE
          So that's it? We're just giving him
          all the money we've saved?

                         AARON
          Well, it's not that simple.

                         MICHELLE
          Why not?

                         RYAN
          Aaron refused to pay.

                         MICHELLE
          How come you couldn't pay, Ryan?

                         RYAN
          That's not the point. Besides, the
          only reason Aaron tore up the check is
          because the guy started talking bad
          about his novel.

                         MICHELLE
          Your novel?
          Michelle looks confused.

                         MICHELLE (CONT'D)
          You let him read your novel? You
          wouldn't let me read your novel. Are
          you screwing him, too? 'Cause Lord
          knows you're not screwing me.

          INT.HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

          Norman comes out of the study and closes the door behindhim.
          He leans against the door, dripping with sweat.

          ANGLE ON: Norman as he pastes a maniacal grin on his face and
          crosses into the living room. As he moves through the throng of
          mourners, they are all unnerved by him.

                         NORMAN
          Hi. Excuse me. Hi. Pardon me. Hi.
          The hugesmile never leaves his face.
          ANGLE ON: Ryan, Aaron and Michelle watching Norman, concerned.
          Norman approaches and stands on the other side of the coffin.

                         AARON
          Norman, why are you grinning like
          that?

                         NORMAN
          (to Aaron and Ryan)
          Can you come to the study for a
          second?
          Aaron can see from Norman's face, and the sweat on his forehead,
          that something serious has happened. Then he sees Cynthia
          sitting in the corner.

                         AARON

                         (TO MICHELLE)
          I'll be back soon. Can you check on
          Mom?

                         MICHELLE
          Sure.
          They exit. Michelle crosses to Cynthia.

                         MICHELLE (CONT'D)
          Hey, are you doing okay? It's going
          to be alright.

                         CYNTHIA
          If you've never given life, child, how

          Jeff is leaning on the window. There's a knock at the door.

          AARON (O.S.)
          It's Aaron.
          Jeff opens the door. Norman, Ryan and Aaron enter. Norman

          There's no point.

          What do you mean "there's no point"?!

          Look at him! He's dead!

          Dead, dead?

                         RYAN

          What the hell did you do to him?

                         NORMAN
          We didn't do anything!

                         AARON
          Well he was alive when I left.

                         JEFF
          He hit his head on the table.

                         AARON
          Oh no. This is really bad. This is
          really, really bad.

          They'll kill me. Oh my God, I'm going
          to die. I'm going to die in prison.
          Oh my God, do you know how fast a rash
          spreads in prison?
          Aaron smacks Norman.

                         AARON
          Pull yourself together!
          Norman calms down.

                         NORMAN
          Thanks, man.
          After a beat, Ryan speaks.

                         RYAN
          Look, no one here knows who this guy
          is. Nobody knows his name. They
          probably didn't even notice him.

                         AARON
          Didn't notice him? He's four fucking
          feet tall.

                         RYAN
          Look, all we have to do is get rid of
          the body. It'll be like he came and
          left.

                         AARON
          Get rid of the body?! It took me two
          months to get rid of a couch.

                         JEFF
          Did any of you happen to notice the

          You have to admit, it makes sense,
          Aaron. The coffin's there, the hole
          in the ground's there... He'll be
          gone, finished, end of story...
          Unless you have a better suggestion.
          Aaron desperately tries to think of an alternative.

          Derek and Elaine are sitting in the corridor. Elaine looks
          drained of energy. Derek's smoking a cigarette.

                         DEREK
          It's funny. No matter what you say,
          I'm convinced we'll be together.

                         ELAINE
          Yeah, well, we all make mistakes... I
          used to be convinced I was going to
          marry Prince. What happened there?

                         DEREK
          You still could.

                         ELAINE
          You're an idiot.

                         DEREK
          I'm serious. You only live once. You
          might as well do whatever it is that
          makes you happy.

                         ELAINE
          Yes, but maybe I don't think of life
          anymore as all about me, me, me.
          Maybe I've discovered there's
          something outside of myself that I
          care about. And maybe you should,
          too.
          Derek looks hurt.

          Please, baby, put your clothes on.
          We're at a funeral!

          This isn't really happening. Oscar,

          What's that?
          Aaron slams the door. We can hear Russell's muffled shouting
          coming from behind the bathroom door.

          Another loud bang on the door.

          Aaron, open the door.
          Norman opens the door as Aaron runs over to keep Derek from
          entering.

          Aaron opens the door an inch.

          Look, Oscar's on the roof stark naked.
          He saw me kissing Elaine and now he's

          I think I can get rid of this guy, but

          Norman looks around and sees that it's clear. He goes back to

          Make sure no one comes in.
          As they disappear around the corner,, Norman closes the study
          door. He turns just in time to find Reverend Davis approaching.

          Aaron and Ryan get to the coffin and Ryan opens it up.
          There's an intense moment as they look down at their father in
          the coffin. They both stop for a moment, speechless.

                         RYAN
          Aaron, we have to do this.
          Aaron looks up at Ryan and nods his assent. Ryan and Aaron lift

                         (TO OSCAR)
          You idiot! What the hell is wrong
          with you? Stay away from my daughter.

                         ELAINE
          Look, Dad--

                         DUNCAN
          Elaine, stay out of this.

                         ELAINE
          No, I'm not staying out of this.
          Remember how I told you we were moving
          in together? Well, I lied. We're
          getting married.
          Duncan is shocked.

                         DUNCAN
          You're what?!

                         ELAINE
          We're getting married.

                         DUNCAN
          Elaine, you don't have to marry him
          just because you're pregnant.

                         ELAINE
          I'm not marrying him because I'm
          pregnant. I'm marrying him because I
          love him.

                         DUNCAN
          How can you love him? He's an idiot.

                         ELAINE
          Dad, this is my life. If you don't
          like it, too bad. But if you want to
          keep me and my child in your life,
          you'd better change your attitude,
          especially about my husband.

          Elaine exits, taking Oscar with her.

          Bye, Dad.
          They exit.

          EXT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Cynthia walks up to Aaron.

                         CYNTHIA
          Baby, I really think we should start
          again now. Have you seen Uncle
          Russell?
          Aaron remembers where he is and looks at Ryan. They rush off to
          the study, passing Jeff. Jeff checks his pockets and realizes
          the pills are gone again. He goes off to find them.

          INT. STUDY - DAY

          Aaron and Ryan enter the study and head toward the closed
          bathroom door. They open it and find Uncle Russell sitting on
          the toilet.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          What the hell is going on in this
          place?

                         AARON
          I'm so sorry, Uncle Russell. There
          was someone on the roof--

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Never mind that. What about that dead
          body you dragged in here?
          Aaron and Ryan feign ignorance.

                         AARON
          What dead body?

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          Don't mess with me. I know a dead
          body when I see one. I live in a
          retirement home.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Norman sniffs his fingers, worried. In the background we see
          Elaine entering the room with Oscar, now dressed, but still
          looking a bit wired. People respond with scattered applause and
          congratulations.
          Derek walks over and joins Norman.

                         DEREK
          Did you hear that? She's having a
          kid!
          Derek looks at Norman who's looking sort of distant.

                         DEREK (CONT'D)
          How's your skin thing?

                         NORMAN
          Oh that... It's probably nothing. I'm
          more worried about Hepatitis C after
          having Uncle Russell's shit in my
          mouth. I think I'm feeling yellow.
          Norman touches his skin as he walks away, leaving Derek
          confused.
          ANGLE ON: Jeff frantically looking for the pill bottle. He
          gives up and sits in a chair.
          ANGLE ON: Ryan is wheeling Uncle Russell into the room as Aaron
          moves to his seat.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          I'm telling you I saw the guy. He was
          dead!

                         RYAN
          I know you did, Russell. We all did.

                         UNCLE RUSSELL
          No! In the bathroom.
          Ryan offers a look to the other mourners indicating that Uncle
          Russell's a bit mad and shouldn't be listened to.
          ANGLE ON: Michelle comes over to Aaron.

                         AARON
          I can't believe what a nightmare today
          has been.

          Aaron looks at her.

                         MICHELLE (CONT'D)
          For a funeral, I mean...

                         AARON
          Listen, about the condo and the baby,

                         I PROMISE--

                         MICHELLE
          We'll work it out. Let's just get
          this day over with. Then we can worry
          about the rest of our lives.
          Aaron hugs Michelle.

                         AARON
          I can't believe I still have to do
          this eulogy... with everything I've
          just found out.
          A beat.

                         MICHELLE
          It doesn't change anything, does it?

                         AARON
          Not a thing.
          Reverend Davis approaches Aaron, looking at her watch and
          appearing flustered.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          We're going to have to fly through
          this now. I already missed a funeral
          and two Christenings.

                         AARON
          Sure. Let's go.

                         REVEREND DAVIS
          Do you want an open casket?

          AARON/RYAN/NORMAN/JEFF
          No!
          The reverend looks shocked at the reaction, but ignores it. She
          stands up at the front and speaks quickly.

          Alright! Everybody in their seats
          now!
          (she snaps her fingers)
          Hey, you, sit down.
          People settle into their seats. Ryan manages to squeeze in next
          to Martina. He smiles at her, flirtatiously. Cynthia throws
          Ryan a look, and he gets up and goes to sit with her.

          REVEREND DAVIS (CONT'D)
          (speaking very quickly)
          I'd like to apologize on behalf of the
          family for all of the distractions. I
          hope that everyone is settled and
          ready to continue with the service.
          Aaron, the oldest son, would like to
          say a few words about his father.
          Michelle gives Aaron an encouraging look as he makes his way to
          the front.
          Aaron clears his throat and prepares to begin. The room is
          absolutely silent. He takes a deep breath.
          ANGLE ON: The reverend nodding for Aaron to hurry up.
          ANGLE ON: Aaron.

                         AARON
          My father... was an exceptional--

          BANG! BANG! BANG!
          Suddenly, a loud banging emanates from the coffin. Everyone
          stares at it in stunned silence. Jeff looks over to Norman
          whose eyes are as wide as saucers. Aaron looks like a deer
          caught in headlights. He looks at Ryan who gestures to him to
          continue. He nervously struggles on.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          My father was an exceptional man.

          BANG! BANG! BANG!
          Everyone stares at the coffin in awe. Aaron bravely continues.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          Not only did he live for his family,
          but he was always there for others--

                         MOURNER 1
          There's someone in there!

                         OSCAR
          I knew it! I knew it!
          Suddenly the coffin lid flips off and everyone stares in wonder
          as Frank sits up, looking like a crazy person, and babbling
          incoherently.
          Several people scream. Frank opens the other end of the coffin
          and looks at his dead lover.

                         RYAN
          (trying to cover)
          What the hell are you doing in my
          Dad's coffin?
          Frank starts grabbing at Edward's body screaming.

                         FRANK
          Edward! Edward! Edward!
          Ryan, Norman and Jeff try to pull Frank out of the coffin, but
          he's holding onto the corpse.

                         FRANK (CONT'D)
          No! No!
          Finally they get Frank out and carry him from the room. As he
          passes Cynthia, the photos fall out of his pocket at her feet.
          As Duncan closes the coffin again, Cynthia bends down and picks
          up one of the photographs and stares at it. Her face turns to
          horror as she makes out the image. The noise in the room is
          broken by Cynthia's furious cry. She drops the photos and runs
          at Frank.

                         CYNTHIA
          You bastard!
          Cynthia tackles Frank and starts beating him.

                         CYNTHIA (CONT'D)
          (as she hits him)
          He was with you!
          Duncan picks up the photos. He shows them to Uncle Russell.

          in his tank.
          Everything has descended into total chaos until Aaron finally
          shouts across the room.

                         AARON

          MY FATHER WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL MAN!!!
          Everyone, including Frank and Cynthia, looks at Aaron, stunned.
          They all freeze. There's a long silence.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          He had his... shortcomings, but he
          took care of his family. He loved his
          family. He loved this house. He
          worked hard. All I wanted today was
          to show him how much we all loved and
          admired him. To give him the respect
          that he deserved... Is that really so
          much to ask? We all get so distracted
          by the... little things in life. We
          forget about the important things.
          Like the fact that we lost a great
          man.
          The mourners look up at Aaron with undivided attention.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          So maybe he loved "Dreamgirls" more
          than most men. We don't know why a
          man makes the choices he makes. But I
          do know that my father made the best
          choices he could make. Life is
          complicated. We're just thrown here
          together in a world filled with chaos
          and confusion... and we do our best.
          And Dad did his best...
          Aaron looks over at the coffin. As.he speaks, we see shots of
          Cynthia, Frank, Jeff, Norman, Duncan as they are moved by
          Aaron's words.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          He taught us to go for what we wanted
          in life, because you never know how
          long you're going to be here... And
          whether you succeed... or you fail...
          the important thing is that you tried.

          the various other mourners looking at Aaron and listening.

                         AARON (CONT'D)
          So when you all leave here today, I
          want you to remember Dad for who he
          really was... A decent, loving man
          who never condemned anyone for how
          they lived. Who never cast
          disparaging remarks or held prejudices
          against race, gender... height. If
          only we could all be as giving, as
          generous, as understanding as my
          father... Even dead, my father has
          more character than everyone in this
          room. If I am half the man my father
          was, my child will be incredibly
          blessed.
          Aaron turns and walks out of the room. Everyone watches him go.
          Michelle follows him out of the room.

          Aaron is laying on the couch, looking drained. Ryan comes down
          the stairs. It looks like he's had some time to recover. He
          walks over and takes a seat.

          I've asked Mom to come live with me
          for awhile. It'll give you and
          Michelle a chance to breathe a bit,
          you know. Move and everything.

A man in a puffy foam-rubber rhinoceros costume dancing

number and takes a bow. A bleacher full of kids bursts
into wild applause.

After the taping. The rhino lumbers down the hallway
toward wardrobe. He is suddenly grabbed by two large men
and dragged out through the exit into...

                                       DISSOLVE TO:


MONTAGE - RAINBOW RANDOLPH MERCHANDISE

"Sugar Rainbows Cereal," plastic toys lined up on store
shelves, kids playing with Randolph dolls, kids eating
"Rainbow Potato Chips" and "Rainbow Candies." A "Rainbow
Burster," a kind of gun that shoots plastic rainbows.
Marquees announcing upcoming live appearances, etc. We
get the picture. Rainbow Randolph is the king of the
kid shows.


INT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT

A suburban-looking HUSBAND and WIFE enter. They find
Rainbow Randolph sitting alone, drinking a Scotch. Hair
slicked back, sans bow tie, the friendly face no longer
looks so friendly. He nods for them to sit down. After
a nervous beat, the Husband puts a briefcase on the table
and slides it to Randolph. Randolph takes a gulp of his
Scotch. He unsnaps the briefcase and opens it. Five
grand stares him in the face.

                     HUSBAND
             So... uh... you'll make sure my
             boy dances up front, right? Where
             he'll get the most camera time?

Randolph slams the briefcase shut, startling the couple.

                     RANDOLPH
             You want your kid on the show?

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           3.

CONTINUED:

                     HUSBAND
             Of... of course.

                     WIFE
             Yes, very much.

                     RANDOLPH
             Then don't tell me how to run my
             fucking business.

                     HUSBAND
             No, no, we were just --

Randolph rises. He takes a final gulp of his Scotch and
picks up the briefcase.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'll call you if a spot opens up.

He starts to walk off. Suddenly, the Husband and Wife
jump up from the table holding guns.

                     HUSBAND
             Freeze, you cocksucker!

                     WIFE
             Drop the briefcase!

Federal agents storm into the bar and surround Randolph.


EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAWN

Bundles of the morning editions are tossed onto the curb
from passing trucks.   The various headlines blare:

"RAINBOW RANDOLPH BUSTED ACCEPTING BRIBE"

"FCC PROBES KID SHOW BIZ"

"CORRUPTION IN KRINKLELAND"


INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

The Rainbow Randolph/Krinkle Kid set is being dismantled.
Backdrops are rolled up and the giant rainbow centerpiece
is wheeled off. Workers with push brooms sweep up tons
of glittery "magic Rainbow dust."

INT. NETWORK BOARDROOM - KIDNET - DAY

We are TIGHT ON the sweating face of a MAN who looks like
he's about to be executed.

                                                 CUT BACK TO:

                                                      4.

STOKES

is standing at the end of a long conference table as the
NETWORK BRASS glares at him.

                        STOKES
             (addressing the brass)
          Gentlemen, let me be the first to
          say, in all sobriety, that I'm as
          shocked and outraged as all of --

The network CEO, a hog of a man, cuts him off.

                  CEO
          Save it for the papers, Stokes.
          We've got nervous sponsors and an
          angry public -- a combination
          uglier than two monkeys fucking.
          What are you doing about it?

                  STOKES
          Well, sir, I'm currently in the
          process of compiling a list of
          viable replacements and it's my
          hope...

                  CEO
          Clean replacements?    With
          background checks? I assure you,
          Mr. Stokes, this network cannot
          survive another Rainbow Randolph.
          The goddamn P.R. department looks
          like the Jim Jones camp.

Another EXECUTIVE chimes in.

                  EXECUTIVE #1
          Remember, Stokes, this was your
          dog that crapped on our rug.

                        EXECUTIVE #2
          We trusted you, Frank. And now
          we're in a tight spot. We have to
          post our quarterly earnings next
          month, for Christ's sake.

                   CEO
          Whoever takes that slot has to be
          a straight arrow. Clean as a
          whistle.

                  EXECUTIVE #3
          Right. Someone who'll take the
          heat off. One of those sweater
          types. Any chance of luring Fred
          Rogers away from P.B.S.?

                                                      5.

                     EXECUTIVE #4
             Yeah, if we back up the Brinks
             truck.

                           EXECUTIVE #1
             No way. The idea now is to stop
             the hemorrhaging.

                           EXECUTIVE #2
             You better fix this, Stokes. Get
             us a white bread replacement,
             fast. Bland, milk toast. Not a
             speck of controversy.

A giant hand slams on the table. All heads snap.
The CEO drags his fingers along the shiny mahogany.
Deafening sound.

                     CEO
                (calm and measured)
             Squeaky fucking clean.


INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY

Stokes sits behind his mahogany desk, sipping a glass of
wine as he goes over potential Randolph replacements with
NORA BISHOP, his pretty protege.

                     STOKES
             Bumble Bee Billy?

                     NORA
                (reading from a list)
             Wife beater.

                     STOKES
             Square Dance Danny?

                     NORA
             Still appealing the mail fraud
             thing.

                     STOKES
             Skippy Black and the Tippy Trolls?

                     NORA
             Black was deported, and the
             trolls... well, who gives a shit.

Nora kicks the table in frustration.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                          6.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             This is impossible. If I ever see
             that Rainbow Randolph again I'll
             strangle him. Choke the life out
             of him. Squeeze his scrawny neck
             until his eyes pop out of his
             skull and bounce off the walls...

                     STOKES
             Before indulging such cheery
             fantasies, let's just concentrate
             on saving my job. Shall we?

                     NORA
             Sorry, Frank.

Stokes flips through a thick stack of files.      He suddenly
stops at one.

                     STOKES
             What's going on with Sheldon Mopes
             these days.

Nora laughs.

                     NORA
             Oh my God. Have we sunk to that
             level already? Smoochy the Rhino?
             What a sap.

                     STOKES
             Sap's just the pill we need right
             now. Mopes is a straight arrow.
             Always has been.

                     NORA
             The guy can't get arrested, Frank.
             He can't even break into the
             birthday party circuit. Last I
             heard he was working hospitals and
             nursing homes. He's a joke.

Stokes stands up and walks around the room.

                     STOKES
             The truth of the matter is, a
             successful children's show has
             always depended on two simple
             elements: a fuzzy costume and a
             lot of hype. Strip away the foam
             rubber and the network money and
             they're all jokes. Marginal
             talents.. cabaret acts... off-
             Broadway runoff...

                                                     7.

                     NORA
             I probably have ten acts in my
             development file -- acts I've been
             cultivating -- that are more
             deserving than Sheldon Mopes.

                     STOKES
             And each one a moral question
             mark. Something I can't risk at
             the moment.

                     NORA
                (frustrated)
             We can do better than this guy,
             Frank. He brings nothing to the
             table.

                     STOKES
             Except ethics. With Mopes,
             there's never been a whiff of
             controversy. The man's an
             ethical, harmless, cornball. In
             short, a glass of milk on two
             legs.

Stokes stops pacing.

                     NORA
             Don't ask me to do it. You know
             I'll do anything for you, but
             please... not this...

Stokes gazes out the window at the city.

                     STOKES
             Go find Smoochy.


EXT. CONEY ISLAND - EARLY EVENING

The lighted Ferris wheel spins CENTER FRAME. We CRANE
DOWN and eventually LAND ON a side street with the
amusement park looming in the b.g. We're in FRONT of a
small building. The half-lit neon sign reads: CONEY
ISLAND METHADONE CENTER. We DRIFT THROUGH the double
doors THROUGH the reception area where random junkies
loiter and fill out paperwork. We CONTINUE DOWN a
narrow hallway as the faint sound of someone SINGING and
playing the GUITAR INCREASES. We finally burst THROUGH
another set of doors marked "Treatment Room." The
singing now fills our ears as we PUSH IN ON the
"performer" -- a big, puffy, orange rhinoceros. Smoochy.
Or to be more specific, SHELDON MOPES.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          8.

CONTINUED:

Smoochy sits on a stool with his guitar and sings to the
patients as they stand in line before a sliding glass
window, where a nurse hands each person a little cup of
methadone which they immediately drink.

The Smoochy costume is a mass of misshapen orange foam
rubber that exposes Sheldon's painted face in the front.
A multi-colored horn protrudes from his forehead.

                     SMOOCHY (SHELDON)
                (singing to the tune
                 of 'She'll be Comin'
                 round the Mountain')
             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will, yes we will
             We'll get that monkey off your
               back,
             Yes we will...'

             'We'll get that monkey off your
               back
             And get your life right back on
               track
             If you'll just give up the smack
             Yes you will, yes you will!!'

The song ends.       A few baffled junkies applaud.

                     SMOOCHY
             Thanks, fellas. I'm rooting for
             you!

We PAN AWAY FROM Sheldon TO the exit.      Standing there in
her coat, looking mortified, is Nora.


INT. RECEPTION AREA - SHORT WHILE LATER

Nora sits in the reception area. Sheldon emerges in his
street clothes. He carries Smoochy's body on a hanger
over his shoulder and carries a large shopping bag which
holds Smoochy's head.

                     NORA
             Mr. Mopes?

Sheldon stops.

                       SHELDON
             Yeah?

                     NORA
             I, uh, saw your performance
             tonight. Very...
                (searching)
             ... spirited.

                      SHELDON
             Really? Thanks. I would've done
             a longer set if that guy hadn't
             pulled a knife on the security
             guard. Once the pepper spray
             starts flyin', that's it for the
             encores.

                     NORA
             Yes, that did put a damper on the
             evening, didn't it?

                     SHELDON
             Are you a new patient?   On the
             juice, as we say?

                     NORA
             Ah, no. But it's sweet of you to
             assume so.

She hands him her card.     He reads it.

                               SHELDON
             'Nora Bishop. V.P. of
             Development. Kidnet.'
                    (to Nora)
             Good gravy. You work for Kidnet?

                     NORA
             As stated.

Sheldon grabs her hand and shakes it.

                     SHELDON
             Well, it's a pleasure to meet you,
             Nora. A real honor. Hey, you
             hungry?


EXT. CONEY ISLAND BOARDWALK - NATHAN'S HOT DOGS - SHORT
WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Nora stand at the crowded counter at
Nathan's. Sheldon ravenously eats his sloppily-
garnished, oddly colored hot dog. Nora winces as
she watches him.

                                           (CONTINUED)

                     SHELDON
                (with full mouth)
             Soy dogs... never thought I'd
             live to see the day. Organic,
             rich in natural protein, and
             nobody gets killed. Although I
             do feel bad for the beans. Just
             kidding. Sure you don't want one?

                     NORA
             Believe it or not, no.

He takes another bite.

                     SHELDON
             So anyway, like I was saying,
             people always tell me, 'You gotta
             network, Sheldon... you gotta sell
             yourself... or you'll be playing
             the drug clinics and shopping
             centers the rest of your life.'
             And you know what I tell 'em?

                     NORA
             I haven't the foggiest.

                     SHELDON
             I tell 'em, it's not about the old
             handshake and back slap game.
             It's not about adding fuel to the
             shlock machine. It's about doing
             good work. Having integrity.
             Making people happy and delivering
             a positive message. Foundations
             are built with concrete, not
             plaster of Paris!

He pulls the stained, misshapen Smoochy head from the
shopping bag.

                     SHELDON
             This is concrete!   This is
             integrity!

                     NORA
                (calmly)
             I can see that.

Sheldon realizes his voice was getting too loud.

                     SHELDON
             Sorry. As you can imagine, living
             by your convictions can be a
             little stressful at times.

             Are we going into a story?

                     SHELDON
             Thing is, he didn't really pave
             them. Just covered them with
             black paint. Of course, once the
             first rain came along, people
             realized they'd been swindled. I
             vowed to myself back then that I'd
             never make a living through
             deception. Never. Whadda ya
             think of them apples?

Nora looks glassy-eyed.      She takes a deep breath.

                     NORA
             The reason I'm here today, Mr.
             Mopes, as fate would have it,
             Kidnet is currently looking for a
             performer with... convictions.
             And integrity. Someone like...

She almost chokes on the word.

                     NORA
             ... yourself.

Sheldon laughs.

                     SHELDON
             Yeah, right. Got any more jokes?

                     NORA
             I don't think I could top that
             one.

                     SHELDON
             Hold the phone. You're telling me
             that Kidnet is finally ready to do
             a show of Smoochy quality? Of
             Smoochy caliber?

                     NORA
                (dryly)
             Yes... I believe we're ready to
             push ourselves to that level.

                     SHELDON
             I knew this day   would come!
             After all these   years I finally
             meet someone in   the business who
             gets what I do.    Who gets what I'm
             all about. You    get me, don't you,
             Nora?

                     NORA
             I'm afraid so.

                     SHELDON
             Well, Miss V.P. of Development...
             let's go make history!

                                         CUT TO:


PREP MONTAGE

KIDNET STUDIO WARDROBE ROOM. A team of designers and
seamstresses cut, sew and shape endless sheets of orange
foam rubber. Sheldon stands on a wooden box as he's
measured from head to toe. On the wall is a blueprint
labeled "Smoochy the Rhino -- REDESIGN."

A costume designer walks over with the new Smoochy head
and places it on Sheldon.

As seamstresses fit him with the new Smoochy costume,
various signs and billboards FLOAT THROUGH the FRAME,
trumpeting copy like: "IT'S ALMOST SMOOCHY TIME!"
"GET READY TO BE SMOOCHED, AMERICA!" "ONLY TWO MORE
WEEKS TILL SMOOCHY!"


KIDNET STUDIO -C.

Sets, props, and camera equipment are rolled into the
studio. Through a SERIES of DISSOLVES we see the
Smoochyland Magic Jungle take shape.


KIDNET STUDIO -C - LATER

A choreographer maps out a number for Smoochy and the
"Rhinettes." (The Rhinettes are the former Krinkle Kid
little people with horns strapped to their foreheads.)

                                         (CONTINUED)

Nora and Stokes watch from the wings with a mixture of
uncertainty and disgust.

                                         DISSOLVE BACK TO:


WARDROBE ROOM

A seamstress zips up the back of the finished, redesigned
Smoochy costume. Sheldon stands proudly before the
design team. Smoochy is now television ready: smoothed
out, more colorful, less lumpy and exuding sunshiny
happiness.

                                        DISSOLVE TO:


STUDIO -C - BACKSTAGE

Smoochy is about to enter with the Rhinettes.      ANGELO, a
former Krinkle Kid, stands beside him.

                           SMOOCHY
             Angelo, you were always my favorite
             Krinkle Kid. The way you'd click
             your heels during the 'Jellybean
             Jam.' Real artistry. I'm honored
             to have you as a Rhinette.

                               ANGELO
             A job's a job.


STUDIO -C - PRACTICE TAPING

Suddenly lights up in all its multi-colored Smoochyland
glory. The bleachers are full of children.

                     ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
             Hey, kids! Who's your favorite
             rhino?

The kids in the bleachers all scream in unison.

                        KIDS
             Smoochy!

Smoochy bounds out on stage followed by the Rhinettes who
form a dancing circle around him.

                     SMOOCHY
             Hiya, kids!

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                      14.

                     KIDS
             Hi, Smoochy!

                     SMOOCHY
             It's gonna be a fantabulous day in
             Smoochyland!!

The kids cheer as Smoochy and the Rhinettes featuring Angelo
Pike, go into their "It's a Fantabulous Day in Smoochyland"
number -- a catchy, bouncy song and dance routine that plays out
in the sugar-coated jungle of Smoochyland.

                     SMOOCHY
                (singing)
             'Ohhhh... it's a fantabulous day
             in Smoochy-land/Let's have a great
             big cheer for the Smoochy-land
             band/We'll dance with our jungle
             pals, won't that be grand/Oh, it's
             a fantabulous day in Smoochy-
             land!'

Smoochy dances right UP TO the CAMERA, FILLING the FRAME
with his friendly, puffy face.

END of prep MONTAGE.


EXT. DOCK BY RIVER - NIGHT (POURING RAIN)

A disheveled Randolph paces on a deserted dock. The
Brooklyn Bridge looms in the b.g. A car pulls up in the
b.g. Stokes gets out. Randolph moves under an awning.

                     RANDOLPH
             I was starting to think that maybe
             you weren't coming.

                     STOKES
             I agreed to meet you, didn't I?    I
             had a dinner engagement.

Randolph takes a swig from a flask.

                     RANDOLPH
             Really? You know, I used to have
             dinner engagements. Sometimes
             four, five a night. Dinner...
             drinks... I was the toast of the
             fucking town.

                     STOKES
             Don't start, Randolph.   Please.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                     15.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
                (voice rising)
             Cars, boats, whores and horses, I
             had 'em all. When I walked into a
             restaurant, ten guys reached for
             my hat. When I stood up to take a
             piss, they cleared the rest room.
             I'd walk down the street and
             traffic stopped, mouths gaped.
             You know why? You know why,
             Frank?
                (now shouting)
             I was Rainbow fucking Randolph!
             That's why!

                     STOKES
             Are you through?

                     RANDOLPH
             What? You're in a hurry? You
             don't have time for me? The guy
             who earned for you? The guy who
             put those fucking suits on your
             back and the pheasant au vin in
             your Brooklyn mouth?

                     STOKES
             I think it's fair to say we helped
             each other.

Randolph suddenly breaks down.

                     RANDOLPH
                (pleading)
             You gotta fix it, Frank. You
             gotta get me my slot back.

He now clings to Stokes' lapels.

                     RANDOLPH
             How can I sit around while that
             rhinoceros... that horned
             carpetbagger gets a free ride on
             my dime? You and I have history,
             Frank! Please!

Stokes pries Randolph's hands from his overcoat.

                     STOKES
             There's nothing I can do for you.
             Nothing. You're a pariah. I
             can't even be seen with you.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                        16.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             Don't do this to me, Frank. I'm in
             deep, deep shit. They kicked me out
             of the corporate penthouse... I got
             bookies breathing down my neck.
             I'm homeless! Don't you hear what
             I'm saying? I'm not gonna make it!
             The clock's ticking! Put yourself
             in my shoes, for Christ's sake!

                     STOKES
             The ugly truth is, your shoes have
             become my shoes. As long as the
             rhino's on the air, everything's
             by the book. No skim, no
             percentage. Nothing. The network
             wanted squeaky clean and they got
             it. And believe me, Mopes is
             sparkling.

He looks Randolph squarely in the eye.

                     STOKES
             You're totally broke? You don't
             have a dime left to your name?

                           RANDOLPH
             Yes! Exactly! That's what I'm
             trying to tell you!

Randolph looks at him hopefully as Stokes straightens his
tie.

                     STOKE
             Don't contact me again, Randy.
             Ever.

Stokes walks off.    Randolph watches him disappear through
the mist.

                           RANDOLPH
             You'll get yours, Frank! The rhino
             too! Do you hear me?! The wheels
             are turning!

Stokes is gone. Randolph takes a swig from his flask and
wipes his chin with his sleeve. He stares out at the
river.

                     RANDOLPH
                    (quietly to
                     himself)
             Sooner or later, even a guy who's
             squeaky clean falls into mud.

THUNDER CLAP.

                                                         17.

FADE IN:

INT. NORA BISHOP'S OFFICE - CLOSE ON LITTLE MECHANICAL
SMOOCHY THE RHINO - DAY

as it erratically limps forward before DROPPING OUT OF
FRAME.


WIDER

The wind-up Smoochy lays upside-down on the carpet next
to Nora's desk, legs grinding lamely in the air. Various
Smoochy items are spread out on her desk top. A
restless-looking Sheldon and a few members of Nora's
staff are in on the meeting.

                   NORA
           Again, these are just prototypes.
           I've been assured by FunZone that
           all the bugs will be worked out
           before Christmas.

Sheldon raises his hand.   Nora ignores him and looks at
her watch.

                   NORA
           Okay, so let's recap before we
           break up...
              (refers to notes)
           Yes to the Smoochy ice pops. No to
           the Smoochy string cheese. And
           we're in a dick-measuring contest
           with Brown & Brown over the
           shampoo split.

Sheldon suddenly stands up.

                   SHELDON
           Okay, time out, people! If I may
           interject, I think we're putting
           the cart before the horse here...

Nora throws him an icy look.

                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         18.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Smoochy's still earning the trust
             of the kids. We don't want to
             compromise that by asking them to
             buy shampoo and cheese. How 'bout we
             just concentrate on doing the best
             show possible. Huh? Without all
             the bells and whistles and
             rickata-rackita. What do you say,
             guys?

Nora casually picks up a Smoochy Frisbee from her desk
and sails it toward the open door. It lands in the
hallway.

                     NORA
                (monotone)
             Oh, damn.

                     SHELDON
             No problem, I'll get it.

He walks out to the hallway.

                     NORA
                (to staffer)
             Shut the door please, John.

John shuts the door.

                     NORA
             Now lock it.

He locks it.

                     NORA
             Thank you.


EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT

Nora emerges from the revolving door of the Kidnet
building which is located in the heart of Times Square
and heads down Broadway. Sheldon emerges from the
building.

                     SHELDON
             Hey, Nora, wait up.

She keeps walking. Sheldon catches up and walks
alongside her, occasionally getting jostled by passersby.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                        19.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Good meeting today. I thought we
             tackled some hot issues.
             Although, I'll be honest, there
             were a few times that I felt my
             voice wasn't being heard.

                     NORA
             I think that's a conservative
             estimate.

                     SHELDON
             I just want the show to have some
             weight, you know? Some substance.
             Silly songs, sure -- but with a
             message. Pop quiz: How many
             original compositions are in the
             Smoochy songbook?

                     NORA
             Do you sense my complete lack of
             interest?

                     SHELDON
             Try two thousand. Covering every
             topic from how yummy vegetables
             are to the importance of donating
             plasma. Don't you get it, Nora?
             I'm a valuable resource. Use me.

Nora stops.    She looks Sheldon in the eye for the first
time.

                     NORA
             Can I make this real easy for you?

                     SHELDON
             Sure.

                     NORA
             The only reason you're on TV right
             now is because Rainbow Randolph is
             a degenerate scumbag. I didn't
             discover you, I delivered you.
             Like a bag of groceries. I have a
             bigger emotional investment in my
             nail polish. So don't peddle your
             sap to me, rhino. Your job is
             just to smile and nod your head.

She walks off.

                                                        20.

INT. PATSY'S - NIGHT

Sheldon sits at the bar in the restaurant, nursing a
drink and talking to the BARTENDER. He seems slightly
drunk.

                  SHELDON
          ... No, no, you misunderstand me.
          It's not that I'm literally
          comparing Captain Kangaroo to
          Jesus Christ. I'm just saying
          that the Captain, like Christ, was
          someone you could believe in.
          Those guys didn't care about bells
          and whistles and rickita-rackata.
          It was all about the work.
          Especially Jesus. Forget about
          it.

The Bartender nods and starts to pour Sheldon another
drink.

                  SHELDON
             (waving him off)
          That's okay, my good man.    Three's
          my limit.

                  BARTENDER
          I never saw anyone get loaded on
          orange juice before.

                  SHELDON
          Back in my college days I could
          put away a carton of the stuff.

A sharply-dressed man, BURKE BENNETT, sits down next to
Sheldon.

                  BURKE
             (to Bartender)
          Gimme a Five Crown.

The Bartender nods.    He looks over at Sheldon.

                   BURKE
          Smoochy the Rhino.    Wow.   I'm a
          big fan.

                  SHELDON
             (flattered)
          Gee, thanks. I usually don't get
          recognized without my horn.

Burke extends his hand.

                  BURKE
          Burke Bennett.    I represent kid
          show talent.

                                                   21.

INT. PATSY'S - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon and Burke now sit at a corner table.

                  BURKE
          Look, Shel, Frank Strokes ain't in
          the business to make you rich.
          He's in it to make Frank Stokes
          rich. That's how these network
          goons operate.

                  SHELDON
          That's so sad. Is it just me, or
          is that sad?

                  BURKE
          You know, years ago, a client of
          mine, Dicky Gimble, was having a
          problem...

                  SHELDON
          Wow, you represented Dicky Gimble?

                  BURKE
          Yeah, before the asshole found
          religion. Anyway, Stokes was
          trying to screw my boy out of some
          merchandising points. Claimed he
          had a warehouse full of Dicky
          dolls that weren't moving. Now
          Frank and I are old friends, so I
          say to him, 'Okay, cock, show me
          the warehouse' -- see, I know the
          fucking warehouse is in the Bronx,
          and I know it's emptier than my
          wife's head.
             (chuckles)
          To make a long story short, I walk
          out with a check for a hundred
          grand and Stokes is sitting there
          with his thumb up his ass.

Burke laughs.

                  SHELDON
          That's very amusing, but I don't
          care about Smoochy dolls and
          Smoochy floor wax... I just want
          more creative input. This rhino
          came from my womb. I bore him, I
          nursed him, and dammit...

He pounds his fist on the table.

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        22.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             I should be the one who raises
             him!

                     BURKE
             Shel, it's all about the dough.
             After you get the money, you get
             the power. And after you get the
             power, you can have Smoochy walk
             on stage with a hard-on if you
             want.

                     SHELDON
             It's funny, that never crossed my
             mind.

Burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.

                     BURKE
             Unfortunately, until then...
             you're just another puppet in the
             prop room.

He hands Sheldon his card.

                     BURKE
             Give me a call when you're ready,
             kid. I'll cut the strings and
             open the magic door for you.


EXT. PATSY'S - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph peers through the restaurant's front window. He
shivers from the cold as he watches Sheldon and Burke
shake hands. Burke heads for the exit. Randolph quickly
ducks into the shadows. A moment later, Burke exits the
club and walks down the street. Randolph pops out.

                     RANDOLPH
             I saw you! I saw you in there...
             at my table... talking to him.

                     BURKE
             Yeah, so what do you want?    A
             parade?

                     RANDOLPH
             You're my agent! Or did you
             forget that?

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                      23.

CONTINUED:

                     BURKE
             Not anymore, pal. You're a
             cigarette butt. Go lay in the
             gutter.

Burke walks off.


EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

In the litter-strewn alley, we PAN ACROSS several grocery
bags, broken egg shells, flour bags, butter wrappers,
mixing bowls and other baking ingredients. The PAN ENDS
ON Randolph, who stands over a barrel fire, holding a
spatula. A cookie sheet rests on the barrel. Randolph
removes the cookie sheet and gazes at it gleefully. We
now see that the cookies are phallic-shaped.

                     RANDOLPH
             Ah! They're beautiful! A perfect
             batch of cock cookies for a very
             special rhino.

He sets the tray aside.

                     RANDOLPH
             Oh yes, you're going to learn
             about shame, my dear Smoochy.   And
             I'm your professor.

He laughs.


INT. KIDNET STUDIO - STAGE B - DAY

It's thirty minutes before a Smoochy taping. Dozens of
giddy children are led into the studio where they take
seats on the bleachers.


BACKSTAGE

Sheldon, in the Smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to
Nora. He holds a rundown for that day's show.

                     SHELDON
             Excuse me, Nora. Why was the
             'Please and Thank You Song' cut?

                     NORA
             Because it's sappy and it takes
             away from the 'Cookie Song.'

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       24.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Takes away? It enhances it! The
             cookie song is a meaningless piece
             of fluff without the 'Please and
             Thank You' coda! That's the moral
             anchor! That's where the lesson
             is! You can't sell the sizzle
             without the steak!

                     NORA
             It's cut. And I want the 'Cookie
             Song' lyrics changed back to the
             way they were originally scripted.

                      SHELDON
             I can't do that. I will not
             condone children consuming endless
             amounts of refined sugar. I have
             to look myself in the mirror every
             morning.

                     NORA
             This is network television, not a
             sprout farm. We're here to sell
             sugar and plastic. That's what
             keeps the lights on.

                     SHELDON
             You're treating me like a puppet.
             You know that? Well, guess
             what? I am not your puppet.

                     NORA
             Since when? Now get your spongy
             orange ass out there and dance
             for the cameras.

An angry Sheldon storms off in frustration, but then
stops. He looks back at her.

                           SHELDON
             We have different eyes, Nora.
             When I go out there I see kids.
             You see wallets with pigtails.

He moves on. Nora stares at him as he walks away. He
obviously got to her. As Sheldon heads toward the
studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring
at him from under the stairwell. After a beat,
Randolph emerges and slinks backstage. He's
clutching a duffle bag.

                                                       25.

INT. PROP ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door.
He scurries over to the prop shelf and locates Smoochy's
multicolored "magic cookie bag." He opens it and tosses
the cookies into the trash can. Reaching into his
pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. He
chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.

                  RANDOLPH
          Bon soir, la Smoochy.   Welcome to
          fatty Arbuckle-land.

He cackles to himself. He then notices a box in the
corner of the room. Scribbled in magic marker on the
side are the words: "Rainbow Randolph crap." He walks
over and pulls the box out. He slowly opens the flaps.
Inside is his old costume. He pulls it out and clutches
it lovingly. He smells it. The ECHOEY SOUND of his
THEME SONG comes flooding back to him for a moment,
along with the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING.

                        RANDOLPH
                 (softly to himself)
          Don't worry, little ones. Rainbow
          Randolph will return...
                 (with rising anger)
          After these messages!

He holds up Smoochy's magic cookie bag.   He then stuffs
his old costume into his duffle bag.


INT. STUDIO B - LATER

The "Smoochy Show" is in the middle of a taping. The
Smoochyland Band is playing a fast, jazzy number ("Doin'
the Jiggy Ziggy") as Smoochy, the Rhinettes, and several
kids dance frenetically. The kids in the bleachers are
in hysterics as Smoochy shakes his body spastically. The
song finally ends. The kids in the bleachers jump to
their feet, cheering and applauding.

                  SMOOCHY
          Boy, all that jiggyin' and
          ziggyin' sure makes a fella
          hungry! Now if only I had my
          super duper, super secret, super
          special...

The kids in the bleachers erupt in unison:

                  KIDS
          Magic Cookie Bag!

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                      26.

CONTINUED:

                     SMOOCHY
             Right-o-riffic!
                (looks skyward)
             Magic Cookie Bag, I command thee!
             Come to your lord and master!

The lights dim as the Smoochyland Band plays the "2001
theme." Smoochy's Magic Cookie Bag is lowered from the
ceiling by a filament wire. The kids go crazy.

                     SMOOCHY
                (singing)
             'Lookie, lookie, lookie, here
             comes the cookies! Fresh and
             organic, no need to panic! Right
             from the soil, no tropical oils!
             Sweetened with juice, for an
             energy boost! Fiber galore,
             you'll be askin' for more...'


ANGLE ON NORA

She looks pissed, but then looks over at the kids in the
bleachers. Their faces are filled with laughter. For
the first time she feels the connection Smoochy has with
them.


ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He peers out from his hiding place backstage. His eyes
widen with delight as the Magic Cookie Bag continues its
descent.


ANGLE ON SMOOCHY

The cookie bag finally reaches Smoochy. He holds the bag
high above his head in a religious ceremonial fashion as
the Rhinettes and the kids crowd around him.

                     SMOOCHY
             Oooh... just the smell of
             unprocessed flour makes my tummy
             do somersaults!


ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

                     RANDOLPH
                (under his breath)
             Whatever that means, you fucking
             retard.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                        27.

CONTINUED:

SMOOCHY

His puffy orange hand reaches for the bag's clasp as the
MUSIC reaches its CRESCENDO.


RANDOLPH

He's practically shaking as he suppresses an insane
laugh.

                     RANDOLPH
             Give 'em a cookie... give 'em a
             cookie...


SMOOCHY

He reaches into the bag, and with a grand flourish, pulls
out a flaming red penis cookie. The cookie is somewhat
misshapen and not perfectly formed. Smoochy gets a big
grin.

                     SMOOCHY
             Wow! Look at this cookie, kids!
             A rocket ship!

The kids "ooh" and "ahh."


ANGLE ON RANDOLPH

He looks confused.

                           SHELDON
             What a special day with such
             special cookies!


BACK ON SMOOCHY

Smoochy pretends to "zoom" the penis cookie through the
air.

                     SHELDON
             Rrrrrrrr! Look at me, kids! I'm
             flying to the moon! I'm flying to
             Mars! I'm flying to --

Randolph, whose face is now bright red, can't take it
anymore. He runs onto the stage. He grabs the rocket
cookie from Smoochy.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       28.

                     RANDOLPH
             Are you fucking blind?! It's a
             cock! Not a space ship! Cock!
             Cock!


INT. STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

Three burly Kidnet security guards drag Randolph down the
stairwell. They beat the shit out of him and toss him
through the exit door.


INT. FRANK STOKES' OFFICE - TIGHT ON NEW YORK POST FRONT
PAGE - DAY

The headline reads: "Rainbow Randolph Interrupts Smoochy
Taping." The subhead reads: "Runs Onstage Shouting
Penis Related Obscenities."


WIDE

Burke sits on the couch next to Sheldon, reading the
paper. He shakes his head in disgust. Nora sits in a
chair near Stokes.

                     SHELDON
             Thank you all for coming. I just
             wanted to iron out a few wrinkles
             I feel we're having in the
             communication department. No
             finger-pointing. Lord knows when
             you start pointing fingers,
             someone gets poked in the eye.

Sheldon laughs.    Stokes and Nora sit stone-faced.

                     SHELDON
             Anyhoo, I'd like to turn the floor
             over to my new agent, Mr. Burke
             Bennett. So... heeeeeere's Burke!

Sheldon applauds.    Burke stands.

                     BURKE
             As you can imagine, my client has
             many concerns, not the least of
             which is studio security, but we
             can address that later.

He pats Sheldon's head like a dog.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           29.

                     BURKE
             See this guy, Frank? Take a good
             long look, 'cause this prick saved
             your life. Without him you'd be
             sitting in Kaplan's right now,
             sucking club soda through a paper
             straw.
                (to Nora)
             And, you -- you'd be organizing
             puppet shows for the brats at
             P.S. 86. Excuse me, honey.

                     NORA
             There's no excuse for you.

                     SHELDON
             Man, I love club soda.

Sheldon laughs, trying to lighten the mood.       Burke gives
him an affectionate slap.

                     STOKES
             We've always managed to come to
             some sort of arrangement, Burke.
             Why the fireworks?

                     BURKE
             'Cause I'm holding all the
             gunpowder. I represent the man
             who created, owns, and controls
             every square inch of Smoochy the
             Rhino.

Burke pours himself a drink from Stokes' private bar.

                     BURKE
             God created Adam and what did he
             get? A fucking dud. My guy? He
             breathed life into a winner. And
             anyone who does a better job than
             God is gonna have a price.

                     SHELDON
             Burke, of course, is in no way
             comparing me to God.

                     BURKE
             Yes I am.

                     NORA
             You seem to forget that we went
             out and found 'your guy.' Dug up
             his corpse. Handed him his own
             show when he couldn't sell his
             face to a photo booth.

                     SHELDON
             To be fair, Nora, I was booked to
             open a car wash in Montauk.

                     BURKE
             Oh, so you were doing him a favor?
                (chuckles)
             Allow me to untangle this web of
             shit! I don't care what his
             resume was, I don't care where you
             found him, I don't care if his
             last job was juggling apples for a
             hut full of Pygmies on the
             outskirts of the Congo... the fact
             is, he fits a bill and you need
             him. Like a hungry baby needs a
             big tit. And that, my friends, is
             why you're in a box with no
             ventilation. And that is why the

             he deserves.

                     STOKES
             What is that, exactly?

Burke walks over to Stokes' desk and leans across it.
He's an inch from Stokes' face.

             Heaven, hell, and everything in
             between.

Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the nightclub.    Burke
raises his glass.

                     BURKE
             To the star and new executive
             producer of the Smoochy show! May
             your reign be a long and healthy
             one!

They clink glasses.

                     SHELDON
             I'm still in shock. Complete
             creative control, part ownership
             of the show, discretion over
             merchandising and a dressing room
             with a toilet! Am I dreaming or
             what?

                     BURKE
             And don't forget the corporate
             penthouse. It took me six years
             to get that for Randolph.

                     SHELDON
             Boy, imagine... me, living in a
             penthouse. Who'd a thunk it.

                     BURKE
             It's called the high life, kid.
             Get used to it. Pretty soon
             you'll be burnin' one hundred
             dollar bills just to see
             Franklin break a sweat.

                     SHELDON
             Jeez, I hope not. I have a deep
             respect for money. Not to mention
             Ben Franklin who had some
             remarkable achievements in his
             lifetime.

Burke pulls out a paper bag and hands it to Sheldon.

                     SHELDON
             What's this?

                     BURKE
             That's your graduation present.
             Something you're gonna need now.

Sheldon reaches in the bag and pulls out a revolver. He
recoils in horror and immediately drops it back in the
bag.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                         32.

                     BURKE
             Think of it as a tool of the
             trade.

                     SHELDON
             I've never owned a gun, I've never
             touched a gun, and I don't believe
             in guns. When I played cowboys
             and Indians as a kid, I was always
             the Chinese railroad worker.

                     BURKE
             Trust me, Shel. It's a handy
             accessory in this business. Even
             if you don't load it, have it for
             show. Sometimes that's all you
             need. Especially with a creep
             like Randolph lurking around.

Burke and Sheldon look up and notice the hulking,
grinning figure of SPINNER DUNN standing over them.
Spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his
crooked nose and scarred face. He extends his hand.

                      SPINNER
             Hiya, Smoochy! I'm Spinner!
             Spinner!

                     SHELDON
             Hi there.

                      SPINNER
             I'm so excited to meet you!    I'm
             Spinner!

Spinner's massive hand engulfs Sheldon's.

                            SHELDON
                    (remembers)
             Oh... right. I saw you fight on
             TV once. I think it was your
             farewell bout.

                           RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #1
             Tonight marks Spinner Dunn's final
             appearance in the ring. What a
             pleasure it's been to watch him
             proudly march into the record books
             for taking more blows to the head
             than any fighter in history.

A bloodied, defeated Spinner happily holds up the arm of
his opponent after a match. He then hugs the referee.
He jumps down from the ring and hugs the three judges.

                           RINGSIDE COMMENTATOR #2
             Scrambled a bit? Sure. You don't
             retire with a record of 81-59 and
             wind up the Governor. But on the
             upside, he's got the disposition
             of a collie.

Spinner wades into the stands and starts hugging the
spectators.

INT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT (PRESENT)

Spinner is still pumping Sheldon's hand.

                     SPINNER
             You know what I love, Smoochy? I
             love when you do the Jiggy Ziggy
             dance! You know, the one you do
             during 'Silly Time?'

                        SHELDON
             You bet.     That's a big one.

                     SPINNER
             Wanna see me do it?

                     SHELDON
             Well, I don't know why if there's
             enough room here to...

Spinner starts Jiggying and Ziggying for Sheldon. He
bangs into a table and knocks over someone's drink.

                     BURKE
             Okay, champ, don't get overheated.

Spinner stops, out of breath.       He leans over and hugs
Sheldon.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                        34.

CONTINUED:

                     SPINNER
             I love you.

                     SHELDON
             I... uh... love you, too, Spinner.

A powerful-looking woman, TOMMY COTTER, calls to Spinner
from the bar.

                      TOMMY
             Spinner, come over and meet the
             Senator!

Spinner dutifully hurries over to Tommy.

                     SHELDON
             He seems pretty popular. It must
             take real talent to run a place
             like this.

                     BURKE
             Spinner? The guy couldn't run a
             water faucet. He's just a mascot.
             It's his cousins, a bunch of Irish
             mob boys, who really run the
             joint.


ANGLE ON SPINNER

He shakes the Senator's hand as Tommy and a few other
tough Irish guys stand around. Spinner looks over
towards Sheldon.

                     SPINNER
                (loudly)
             Don't go anywhere, Smoochy! I'll
             be right back after I take a dump!

Spinner releases the Senator's hand and rushes off.

                     BURKE
             I think you made a new friend,
             kid.

                                                        35.

INT. ANGELO PIKE'S RUNDOWN APARTMENT
(LOWER EAST SIDE) - NIGHT

We met him backstage with Smoochy... innocent face...

Angelo stirs a pot of soup in the worn-down but tidy
apartment. A "Rhinette" costume is draped over one of
the chairs. There is a sudden LOUD POUNDING on the door.
Angelo puts the spoon down and reaches behind some spices
on the shelf above. He pulls out a revolver. The
POUNDING continues.

                  ANGELO
          Yeah, who is it?

                  RANDOLPH (O.S.)
             (friendly)
          Open up, buddy! It's me,
          Randolph! It's been a long time!

Angelo puts the gun in his waistband and walks to the
door. He slowly slides the chain off and opens the door
a crack. Peering in at him are the bloodshot eyes of
Rainbow Randolph.

                   ANGELO
          Randy?

Randolph suddenly kicks the door open and tackles Angelo.
Randolph sits on top of the little man.

                  RANDOLPH
          You fucking traitor! My body's
          barely cold and already you work
          for the rhino?

                  ANGELO
          I don't know what you're talking
          about.

                  RANDOLPH
          Don't lie to me! I heard all about
          it! You strapped that horn on
          faster than a cheerleader gets the
          clap!

                  ANGELO
          I gotta eat, don't I?

                  RANDOLPH
          You're a Krinkle Kid!   Not a
          Smooch-bag! Say it!

                  ANGELO
          Rhinette!

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       36.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             Say it: I am a Krinkle Kid! Say
             it, before God! On the soul of
             Jesus Christ! Say what you are!

Angelo punches Randolph in the mouth and flips him over.
He now sits on Randolph, pointing the revolver to his face.

                     ANGELO
             I'm a Rhinette. Got that? The
             Krinkle Kids are ten feet under.
             With you.

Randolph starts crying like a child.

                     RANDOLPH
                (blubbering)
             I missed you so much. Can I stay
             here? I got no place to go.

Angelo sighs and puts the gun away.


INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - SHORT WHILE LATER

Angelo and Randolph sit at the small kitchen table.
Angelo watches as Randolph ravenously eats a bowl of
soup.

                     RANDOLPH
             ... They kicked me out of the
             corporate penthouse. Big
             surprise. Sons-a-bitches. That's
             how I got this beauty.

He points to a nasty bump near his eye.

                     RANDOLPH
             And of course, there's this...

He yanks his lip back to reveal a missing tooth.

                     RANDOLPH
             That happened after my little
             visit to the studio the other day.
             Network security. Fucking savages.

He slurps another spoonful of soup and spits a bay leaf
on the floor.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                         37.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             I got liens, back taxes, lawyer's
             bills, threats against my life...
             I basically got the whole fucking
             world up my ass. It's okay, I got
             a loooong memory, son.
                (Amos and Andy dialect)
             What dey sow, dey gonna reap.

He cackles insanely as he picks up a bottle of gin and
takes a deep swig. He passes out and falls off the
chair. Angelo leans down and lifts his head off the
floor.

                     ANGELO
             Stop doing this to yourself!

Randolph doesn't respond.    Angelo slaps his face.

                     ANGELO
             Wise up! You hear me? Don't piss
             your life away like this.

                     RANDOLPH
                (half-conscious)
             It's the rhino, Angie. He's been
             sent by the devil. Sent from hell
             to destroy me. Smoochy... is the
             face of evil.


EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - MORNING

We are ON the smiling goofy face of Sheldon, whose
picture graces the front page of Variety under the
headline, "MOPES TO EXECUTIVE PRODUCE SMOOCHY SHOW." The
subhead reads, "TENURE TO BEGIN TODAY." A dollar bill is
slapped down over the picture.

We WIDEN OUT to see Sheldon buying the magazine at the
newsstand in front of the Kidnet Building. He turns and
walks toward the Kidnet entrance. He stops and looks up
at the building. Smiling, he takes a deep breath and
enters.


INT. KIDNET HALLWAY - FEW MOMENTS LATER

Sheldon whistles as he walks down the hall, giving
cheerful "hellos" and "good mornings" along the way.   He
enters Nora's office.

                                                        38.

INT. NORA'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Nora is on the phone. She pretends not to notice him.
Sheldon bides his time by inspecting knickknacks,
examining photos on the wall, etc. Finally, he half-
whispers/half-mouths to her:

                  SHELDON
          Whenever you get a chance... I
          just need a second.

                  NORA
             (into the phone)
          Listen, can I call you back?
          Yeah, some asshole's screaming in
          my ear. Thanks.

She hangs up.

                  SHELDON
          I'm sorry, you didn't have to hang
          up.

                  NORA
          If I didn't you'd still be here.

                  SHELDON
          But I am still here.

                  NORA
          I'm hoping to correct that.

                  SHELDON
          Nora, I want us to start off on
          the right foot. I want you to
          know that I value your input and I
          don't want you to feel intimidated
          just because the power structure
          has changed a bit. I consider you
          a partner.

                  NORA
          Great. That'll come in handy if
          we're ever at a square dance.

                  SHELDON
          Well, I was never much of the
          do- se-do type, but what I would
          love to do is take you out to lunch
          one day. You know, just two
          colleagues chewing the fat...
          forming a mutual respect...
          planting the seeds of
          cooperation...

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         39.

CONTINUED:

                        NORA
             No.

                     SHELDON
             Fair enough. If you change your
             mind --

                        NORA
             I won't.

Sheldon just nods and starts to exit.

                     SHELDON
             Okay then, I'll be in my office if
             you need me. If you want to
             brainstorm about anything. Ideas
             and so forth.

He passes a plant by the door.

                        SHELDON
             Ficus?

She ignores him.      He exits.


INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly down the hallway.     He no longer has
a bounce in his step.


INT. SHELDON'S NEW OFFICE - MOMENT LATER

Sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over
to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time.

                               SHELDON
             Wow...

                           TOMMY (O.S.)
             My cousin Spinner's take quite a
             shine to you.


Sheldon jumps. He's surprised to Tommy from Spinner
Dunn's restaurant. Tommy's crew, ROY, DANNY, JIMMY and
SAMMY occupy the sofa.

                     TOMMY
             Ever since you came in the
             restaurant. He can't stop yakkin'.

                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                        40.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             Well, he's a very nice man. Very
             sweet disposition for someone that
             size.

                     TOMMY
             So, I was wondering if maybe you
             could give him a little floor
             space.

                     SHELDON
             I'm sorry?

                     TOMMY
             You know, a little part on the
             show. You're the executive
             producer now. You call the shots,
             right?

                     SHELDON
             Uh, that's a very sweet offer, and
             I love Spinner, but TV is a
             complicated medium and... I mean,
             that would be like me getting into
             the ring with a prizefighter.
                (laughs)
             Can you imagine such a thing?
             Boom. K.O.! What's the alphabet,
             Mommy?

Sheldon laughs again.       Tommy gets quiet.

                     TOMMY
             This makes me sad.    Very, very,
             sad.

                     DANNY
             What's wrong, Tommy?

                        TOMMY
             Nothing.     I'm just very sad right
             now.

                     SAMMY
             Who made you sad, Tommy?

                     TOMMY
             I don't want to mention names.

The guys look menacingly at Sheldon. They rise and walk
around his desk until they're on either side of him.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                     SHELDON
             You know what? Maybe I can find
             Spinner a little something to do
             on the show. That's probably the
             best solution.

Tommy now smiles and walks over to Sheldon.       She musses
Sheldon's hair.

                     TOMMY
             You're a good boy, Mopes. Don't
             think we don't remember favors.

INT. SHELDON'S OFFICE - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon is in a meeting with a man, SONNY GORDON.

                     SHELDON
             Look, I appreciate the visit, but
             I'm just putting together a little
             petting zoo segment. Nothing
             fancy -- a few kittens... maybe a
             duck...

                     SONNY
             If you're looking to bring in that
             many pieces I gotta put a crew
             together. Plus, we're lookin' at
             transpo, a few leash handlers, a
             cleanup boy and a doper to keep
             the inventory quiet.

                     SHELDON
             Jeez, this all sounds awfully
             elaborate. I might have to forgo
             the union and just borrow a few
             animals from a pet shop.

                     SONNY
             I wouldn't recommend it. Miss
             Carol from Romper Room tried that
             once and she's still limping.

INT. SHELDON'S OFFICE - SHORT TIME LATER

A frazzled-looking Sheldon is meeting with BEN FRANKS.

                  BEN
          On behalf of FunZone Toys, I'd
          like to congratulate you on your
          recent promotion, and present you
          with a small gift.

SUPERIMPOSE:   BEN FRANKS, V.P., FUNZONE TOYS

Ben reaches into his breast pocket and drops a large wad
of money on Sheldon's desk that lands with a thud.

                  SHELDON
          Uh... that's nice of you, Ben, but
          a card would have been fine.

                  BEN
          FunZone Toys would very much like
          the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.

                  SHELDON
          Is this... I mean... are you
          offering me a bribe or something?

                  BEN
          FunZone Toys would very much like
          the Smoochy contract, Mr. Mopes.

Sheldon picks up the money and tosses it back to Ben.
Sheldon rises from his desk.

                  SHELDON
          Normally, sir, we take the trash
          out at the end of the day, but I
          think I'll make an exception in
          your case.

Sheldon escorts Ben out the door and slams it shut.   The
PHONE RINGS. Sheldon walks over and picks it up.

                   SHELDON
          Yes?

                  ASSISTANT (V.O.)
          A Mr. Feedlepepper on line two.

                   SHELDON
          Who?

                  ASSISTANT (V.O.)
          He says he's an old friend.

Sheldon punches line two.

Sheldon hangs up stunned.       Nora walks in holding the daily
news.

                           NORA
             Congratulations on your little ice
             show.

She tosses the paper on his desk.

             What happened to your precious
             integrity? Or was that just part
             of your dog and pony act.

She exits.    A confused Sheldon looks at the "Around Town"
column.

INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - EVENING

We are TIGHT ON the feet of an Irish dancer doing a sort
of Riverdance. We WIDEN OUT and the rest of the dancers
come INTO FRAME. Spinner and the mob ar clapping and
whooping.

Sheldon and Burke sit at a table in the dark club having
a conversation.

                        SHELDON
          Burke, I never agreed to do an ice
          show.

                        BURKE
          Shel, do you know what kind of
          cash we'll take in between the
          gate and concessions? A venture
          like this gets you money and
          muscle. Times twenty.

                        SHELDON
          Ice shows represent everything I'm
          against. They're mindless
          spectacles whose main purpose is
          to sell overpriced sugar-water and
          cheap plastic toys that splinter
          in a kid's mouth on the ride home.

                        BURKE
          Look, I know you got this fetish
          for ethics, but now's not the time
          to fly that kite. No one's ever
          refused a shot at an ice show.

Sheldon tears the contract in half.

                        SHELDON
          Until now. Smoochy doesn't sell
          out, Burke. You should be proud
          of that. Proud that you represent
          a client who paves driveways, not
          paints them over.

                        BURKE
          I'm thrilled, Shel. Knocked out.

Burke just sits there, stunned.   A waitress, SANDY,
passes by the booth.

                        SHELDON
          I'll have a pineapple juice,
          Sandy.

                           SHELDON
             I'm feeling feisty tonight.


INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY

We are now on a drum solo. Ernie the Elephant of the
Smoochyland Band works it. The animal band plays a
sloppy version of "Pop Goes the Weasel." End on Spinner
Dunn -- the newest and by far largest member of the band.
Spinner holds s cowbell and seems to be concentrating
intently on the proper moment to hit it. Unfortunately,
his rhythm is off, which throws the rest of the band off
as well.

We WIDEN OUT to see Smoochy and the Rhinettes attempting
to dance to the off-kilter rhythm. The song finally
ends. The Rhinettes glare at Spinner. Smoochy addresses
the camera.

                           SMOOCHY
             Boy, wasn't that fun? In an
             awkward kind of way? Anyhoo, how
             'bout a big round of applause for
             the newest member of the
             Smoochyland Band... former
             heavyweight contender, Spinner
             Dunn!

Spinner stands up to take a bow and almost knocks the
entire bandstand over. There is a smattering of confused
applause from the kids in the bleachers. Spinner drops
the cowbell and it clangs on the studio floor.

                              SPINNER
             Shit.   Sorry.


INT. BACKSTAGE - AFTER SHOW

A beaming Spinner runs up to Sheldon, who's still in
costume.

                           SPINNER
             Did I do good, Sheldon, huh?   Did I
             do good?

                           SHELDON
             Yeah, that was great, Spinner.
             Just watch your elbow next time.
             Pinky's probably gonna lose that
             tooth.

                            SPINNER
             Okey doke.   I'm gonna go get drunk
             now.

Spinner skips off humming "Pop Goes the Weasel" and
banging his cowbell. Nora passes Sheldon backstage.

                           NORA
             Nice job. Casting the show with
             mental patients, I like that.

                           SHELDON
                    (snapping)
             He is not a mental patient. He's
             an ex-boxer and nightclub owner
             who happens to have the sweet
             innocent brian of a five-year-old!

                           NORA
             Excuse me for not making the
             distinction.

She leaves.


EXT. BROADWAY (TIMES SQUARE) - NIGHT

Sheldon exits the Kidnet building and walks to the curb
to hail a cab. A friendly-looking man in a suit and bow
tie approaches him. This is MERV GREEN.

                     MERV
             Hi there.

                       SHELDON
             Hi.

A limo pulls up in front of them.     Merv opens the back
door.

                       MERV
             Get in.

                     SHELDON
             Thanks anyway, but I'm going

his waistband.

INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon slides into the back seat of the limo. A big
thug in an overcoat, HENRY, is already sitting there.
Merv gets in behind him and shuts the door. Sheldon is
now wedged between the two men as the limo heads down
Broadway. Merv extends his hand.

                     MERV
             Merv Green, Sheldon. It's a
             pleasure to meet you.

                     SHELDON
             If you're hoping for an autograph,
             the gun's a bit much. The whole
             'catch more flies with honey'
             thing -- it really holds water.

Sheldon laughs nervously.

                     MERV
             Sheldon, I represent the Parade of
             Hope Foundation. Maybe you've
             heard of us.

                     SHELDON
             You raise money to build
             children's hospitals, right?

                     MERV
             We've been known to add a brick or
             two, sure.

Merv and the thug laugh.

                     MERV
             Sheldon, let me get right to the
             point -- there's talk on the
             street that you're pulling out of
             the ice show. Is that true?

             ice show, nor would I ever agree
             to do an ice show, and let me add

                     MERV
             Listen carefully, son: Parade of
             Hope has sponsored every Kidnet
             ice show since 1964. We take a
             piece off the top and everybody
             walks away happy. So let's not
             buck history.

                     SHELDON
             Well, I appreciate the offer, but
             for the gazillionth time, I'm not
             doing an ice show, so we have
             nothing to discuss. Now, if
             you'll just pull over, I'll get
             out and we'll say our toodley-dos.
                (to driver)
             Far corner, please.

                (to driver)
             Pull over, Terry.

The car pulls to the curb.

                           MERV
             And as far as the ice show goes...
             I recommend you start shopping
             for skates.

The door pops open and Sheldon is tossed out.

INT. CORPORATE PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

A troubled-looking Sheldon stands on his balcony looking
out at the city. He drinks orange juice straight from
the carton.

Sheldon is on the phone with Burke.

                  SHELDON
          This is unacceptable, Burke!    I'm
          calling the authorities.

                  BURKE (V.O.)
          Don't do it, Shel. You rat on
          Parade of Hope and you'll be lucky
          if they find your toenails. These
          guys are the roughest of all the
          charities.

                   SHELDON
          I was threatened by an
          organization that's supposed to
          help children! What kind of world
          is this?

                   BURKE (V.O.)
          The real one. My advice?
          Consider the ice show and stay
          healthy.

Burke hangs up. After a beat, Sheldon's DOORBELL RINGS.
He walks over to the door and opens it. To his surprise,
Nora is standing there.

                       NORA
          May I come in?

                  SHELDON
          Sure.

Nora enters. She seems a little wobbly.    Sheldon notices
she's holding a pint of whiskey.

                  SHELDON
          Uh... are you okay?

                  NORA
          I'm getting drunk and I'm not used
          to it.

                  SHELDON
          Oh. Well, not to make you feel
          worse, but with alcohol you're
          also consuming empty calories.

Nora looks at him for a moment.

                     NORA
             It's just that... I want to

             rare occasions when I feel the
             need to apologize for something,
             it helps if I'm, you know... shit-
             faced.

                      SHELDON
             Wow.   I'm honored.

Nora trips slightly.     Sheldon takes the whiskey from her.

                     SHELDON
             Why don't we get some air?

He leads her out on the balcony.    They look out at the
city.

                     NORA
             I... I may have been a little
             harsh when we spoke the other day.
             A little out of line.

                     SHELDON
             Well, it wasn't as bad as the week
             before when you called me a pasty-
             faced, no-talent hack.

                      NORA
             Yes, that was probably insensitive
             as well.
                 (looks at him)
             I heard you're not doing the ice
             show. I find that... incredibly
             admirable. Why didn't you tell
             me?

                     SHELDON
             I guess I didn't want to spoil
             your fun. You look so content
             when you're berating me.

Nora looks down.

                     NORA
             I'm afraid I have become a bit
             hardened over the years.
             Sincerity's an easy disguise in
             this business. It's hard to know
             who's on the level.

             'Rickets the Hippo'?

                     SHELDON
             You remember Rickets?

                     NORA
             That was my favorite show when I
             was a kid. Rickets was the one
             face I knew I could trust.

                     SHELDON
             That's how I felt! Rickets had
             real depth. He was my inspiration
             for Smoochy.

                     NORA
             Really? He was my inspiration to
             work in children's television.

                     SHELDON
             I can't believe it. I never met
             anyone who even remembers Rickets.
             Do you remember the Klunky-Wunky
             dance?

                     NORA
             Remember it?   I did it at my first
             communion.

Sheldon starts doing the rather insane-looking Klunky-
Wunky dance. Nora does it with him. They both stop and
look at each other. Sheldon impulsively leans in and
kisses her.

                     SHELDON
             I'm sorry. That was a mistake,
             right? I didn't mean for that to
             hap--

Nora grabs his head and pulls it toward her.       They begin
kissing passionately.

             the others, are you?

                       SHELDON
             No, no.

                     NORA
                (as they kiss)
             You're for real, right?

             Yes, yes.

                     NORA
                (through the kisses)
             I mean, I couldn't tell... First I
             thought it was an act... and then
             I just thought you were a simp or
             something...

                     SHELDON
             Shhh... you don't have to
             explain...

They continue to kiss.      Nora abruptly stops.

                     NORA
             I should go.

                       SHELDON
             Why?

Nora exits the balcony and collects her coat and purse.

                     SHELDON
             What's wrong? Is it the whiskey?
             If you have to throw up, be my
             guest. Anywhere you like.

                     NORA
             It's just getting late.

Sheldon follows her to the door. She stops and looks at
him for a moment. The PHONE starts to RING. Neither of
them says anything for a beat.

                     NORA
             Better get that.    Good night.

She exits. Sheldon shuts the door and sighs. He goes to
the bar to pour himself another orange juice before
picking up the phone.

             Hello?


ANGELO'S APARTMENT

We GO TO a HORIZONTAL SPLIT-SCREEN. Randolph is on the
BOTTOM HALF. He lies on his bed in Angelo's apartment
wearing a bathrobe with a towel wrapped around his head.
His head dangles off the bed as he talks on the phone.
The SHOT is reminiscent of Bye Bye Birdie.

                     RANDOLPH
             Hello, Mr. Mopes? My name is
             Benjamin Kunklepeck and I'm
             calling on behalf of 'Parents for
             Decency in Children's Television,'
             perhaps you've heard of us?

                     SHELDON
             No, but I like where you're coming
             from. It's an issue very close to
             my heart. Why just yesterday I
             was commenting --

                     RANDOLPH
             Sir, we're having a banquet
             tomorrow and we'd be honored to
             have you perform for us. We would
             also like to present you with a
             plaque for your ongoing commitment
             to children's television. The
             presenter will be a young orphan
             with mild asthma. Can you attend?


EXT. VERRAZANO NARROWS BRIDGE - NEXT MORNING

A black Lincoln Town Car travels across the bridge toward
Staten Island.


                    SHELDON (V.O.)
             Thanks for picking me up, Mr.
             Kunklepeck. It's very nice of
             you.


INT. TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon is in the back seat. The Smoochy costume is next
to him. Behind the wheel is Randolph. He's in disguise.

                     RANDOLPH
             Don't be silly. The chance to
             have Smoochy the Rhino perform at
             our little soiree? I'd carry you
             piggy-back through a bed of hot
             rusty glass if I had to.

                     SHELDON
             Well, it's always a pleasure to
             help out a worthy cause. And
             believe me, I've learned lately
             that it's not all sunshine and
             daffodils in the land of non-
             profit.

                     RANDOLPH
             I just looove your show, by the
             way. It's such a refreshing
             change of pace from that dreadful
             embezzler... what's his name
             again? Rainbow something or
             other?

                     SHELDON
             Randolph.

                     RANDOLPH
             Yes. Rainbow Randolph. What a
             scoundrel! He's probably gay too.

                     SHELDON
             Oh, I don't know. I feel sorry
             for him, actually. He obviously
             has problems or issues that he
             needs to sort out.

                     RANDOLPH
                (getting frustrated)
             Yeah, yeah, yeah, but don't you
             take particular glee in that you
             basically stole his time slot?
             Helped shovel dirt onto his
             miserable corpse, as it were?

                     SHELDON
             No, I would never take pleasure in
             someone's downfall. You know the
             old expression about walking a
             mile in another man's shoes?
             Well, that really holds water.
             Just try to imagine --

             You hate him! Admit it!

                     SHELDON
                (uncomfortable)
             Uh... can we listen to the radio?


EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER

The Town Car is parked behind an old warehouse in the
middle of nowhere. Sheldon is now in costume. Randolph
rushes out of the door, very excited.

                     RANDOLPH
             Okay, they're ready for you!

                     SHELDON
             I gotta say, this is a first -- I
             never performed in a tractor parts
             warehouse before.

                     RANDOLPH
             Well, we like to do these things
             no-frills. It's all about the
             kids.

                     SHELDON
             Amen to that.

Randolph opens the door a crack and listens.      We hear an
O.S. VOICE from inside.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
             It gives me great pleasure to
             introduce our very special
             guest... a supporter of the cause
             and a friend to the brotherhood.
             Please welcome, the one, the
             only... Smoochy the Rhino!

We hear APPLAUSE.    Randolph quickly opens the rusty door.

                     RANDOLPH
             Knock 'em dead, kid!

He shoves Sheldon inside.


INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon runs in and immediately starts singing and
dancing on the makeshift stage.
                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         56.

                     SMOOCHY

             friends! How do-you-do,    my pals!
             It's so nice to see good   friends!
             Sing along with me now!    How do
             you do, my good -- '

Sheldon abruptly stops singing as a look of shock comes
over him. PUSH IN ON his troubled face.

INT. WAREHOUSE - SHELDON'S POV

Several hundred men in Nazi uniforms in a warehouse
draped in swastikas. They all start chanting:

                      NAZIS
             Heil Smoochy!    Heil Smoochy!   Heil
             Smoochy!

A huge swastika banner unfurls behind Smoochy, framing
him like Patton in front of the American flag.
Flashbulbs go off. The "Heil Smoochys" continue. A
GERMAN MARCH starts to BLARE from the SPEAKERS. Looking
stunned, Sheldon slowly leans into the mic. He clears
his throat. The MUSIC STOPS. Everyone quiets down. He
searches for just the right words, and finally...

                     SHELDON
             It's my sincere hope that I'm
             dreaming right now, but in the
             event that I'm not... what's the
             deal with the swastikas?

Suddenly, a sea of policemen bursts into the warehouse.

                     LEAD COP
             This is an unlawful assembly, you
             kraut sons-a-bitches! You're all
             under arrest!

Pandemonium ensues us all the Nazis run for cover.
Sheldon stands in the middle of it all, unsure what to
do.


EXT. WAREHOUSE - SHORT WHILE LATER

Sheldon is led from the warehouse in handcuffs and is
barraged with questions from waiting REPORTERS.
Flashbulbs go off as they shout out questions.

Sheldon is shoved into the back seat of a squad car.     It
drives off, SIRENS BLARING.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Randolph dances down the street like Gene Kelly. He
whistles a happy tune and tips his hat to everyone who

             Hi there, poochy!

Coos at a baby in a stroller...

             Well, aren't you the cutest little
             boo-boo in the world!

And grabs a rose from a flower vendor before handing it
to an old lady...

             For you, my dear!   May you live to
             be a hundred!

He continues to dance onward, waving back at everyone.
Unfortunately, he doesn't realize he's heading straight
for a light pole and slams into it with a sickening
smack.

             Fuck!


EXT. KIDNET BUILDING - NIGHT

Nora exits the revolving door of the Kidnet building and
heads down Broadway. Sheldon pops out from a store
front. He's wearing a knit cap and sunglasses to
disguise himself.

             I have to talk to you.

Nora keeps walking.

                                                    60.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             We have nothing to talk about.

                     SHELDON
             Don't tell me you believe what
             they're saying!

                     NORA
             I don't have to believe anyone.
             The picture in the paper said it
             all. No one forced you to perform
             at that rally.

                        SHELDON
             Perform?     I barely sang one song.

                     NORA
             Well maybe next time you'll do
             a longer set.

                     SHELDON
             Nora, I had no idea that was a
             Nazi function. None whatsoever!

                     NORA
             Funny, you'd think the fifty-foot
             swastika you were standing in
             front of might've given you a
             hint.

                     SHELDON
             The papers are blowing that out of
             proportion. It was nowhere near
             that big.

Nora stops and looks Sheldon in the eye.

                     NORA
             Look, the fact of the matter is, I
             don't know you, okay? Not really.
             So don't expect me to go out on an
             emotional limb here.

Sheldon looks crushed.

                     SHELDON
             But what about the balcony? What
             about the Klunky-Wunky dance?

                      NORA
             I was drunk.    Don't read too much
             into it.

She looks at him for a moment and then walks off.

                                                          61.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAYS LATER

A disheveled and unshaven Sheldon wanders the streets,
looking dazed. He's stuffing a cupcake into his mouth
and swigging from a bottle of root beer. He passes a
construction site and notices some graffiti on a wall --
a crudely-drawn goose-stepping Smoochy in a Nazi uniform
and Hitler moustache. Sheldon keeps walking. He
descends the subway stairs at 42nd Street.


EXT. CONEY ISLAND STATION - STREET LEVEL - LATER

Sheldon comes up from the subway.    We see the Cyclone
from Astroland in the b.g.


EXT. SIDE STREET (CONEY ISLAND) - FEW MINUTES LATER

Sheldon stands in front of the methadone clinic he used
to perform at. It's boarded up. He just stares at it.
An OLD VAGRANT walks up to him.

                  OLD VAGRANT
          If you're lookin' to get a cup of
          juice, the well's dried up, son.
          City shut her down. Bastards'll
          put a new pair of tits on the
          Statue of Liberty, but they won't
          help a poor hophead.

The Vagrant shakes his head sadly.

                  OLD VAGRANT
          Just once I wish I had a little
          clout. You know? I'd set things
          straight in this town, believe me.
                 (sighs)
          Hell of a world.

He walks off.

                  SHELDON
             (to himself)
          Hell of a world.

                                                      62.

INT. STOKES' OFFICE

On a large screen TV the smiling Asian face of Takashi
Yamashita, who's singing Cole Porter's "I Get a Kick Out
of You" in Japanese.

CUT BACK to reveal Takashi wearing a white sequined
tuxedo with tails as he plays a white grand piano. He
looks like an Asian Liberace. He is circled by a group
of Japanese children who sing along with him.

                        CHICK (V.O.)
          'Takashi Sings Tin Pan Alley for
          Youngsters' is the hottest show
          on Japanese television. The sweat
          shops are working overtime trying
          to keep up with the demand.
          Record albums, toys, cereal, tee
          shirts, you name it...


INT. STOKES' OFFICE - DAY

Several tough-looking Asian men -- CHICK, SAMBO, and TOBI
-- Takashi's management group -- sits in Stokes' office.
Takashi sits quietly in the corner. Stokes sits behind
his desk, sipping his trademark glass of wine.

                  CHICK
          Look, Stokes, let's cut the
          bullshit. We want Takashi in
          that Smoochy slot and we're willing
          to do whatever it takes to get it.

                  STOKES
          Pardon me for saying this, but for
          a non-resident of this country,
          you speak impeccable English.

                  CHICK
          I'm originally from Teaneck.

                  STOKES
          Ah.

                  CHICK
          We own every hair on this bastard's
          head and we're willing to share a
          few strands... if you get my drift.

                  STOKES
          Well, it's not that simple. I
          have an executive board to answer
          to. I wish I could just snap my
          fingers and make a deal but --

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         63.

CONTINUED:

                     CHICK
             You mean like this?

Chick snaps his fingers and Tobi, the third Asian guy,
walks over and drops a duffel bag on Stokes' desk.

                      STOKES
             Oh my.   And what is this on my
             desk?

                      CHICK
             Two hundred grand in a Louis
             Vuitton duffle bag. Get our boy
             the slot and we'll round it off to
             a million. And you can keep the
             luggage.

Stokes stares down at the bundle of opportunity on his
desk.

                     CHICK
             You're dealing with an honorable
             culture, Frank. We know how to
             play ball.

Stokes unzips the bag and gazes at the money.     He looks
up at Chick and smiles.

                     STOKES
             Gentlemen, I suddenly feel
             invigorated and full of hope.

Chick smiles.


INT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

On Nora's TV screen, we see the black and white image of
Rickets the Hippo doing the "Klunky-Wunky Dance." Nora
sits on the couch and stares hypnotically at the screen.
There is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up and ejects the
"Best of Rickets" tape. She opens the door. To her
surprise, Randolph is standing there.

                     RANDOLPH
             Hiya, cutie!

Before she can respond, he enters the apartment and takes
off his jacket.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                      64.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             So here's the good news: Yes,
             I'll be happy to end my sabbatical
             and return to my old slot. I know
             you and Frank are in a bind, so
             I'll start Monday. Call wardrobe,
             call props, tell 'em the R man is
             back and he's ready to start
             whistlin' dem happy tunes for da
             little chillens.

He flops down on the couch.

                     RANDOLPH
             Ahhh. Who do ya gotta blow to get
             a Scotch around here?

He laughs.

                     NORA
             You've got three seconds to pry
             your ass off my couch and get out.

Randolph jumps to his feet.

                     RANDOLPH
             Dammit, Nora! The rhino's gone!
             You need that slot filled and
             I'm ready to reclaim what's
             rightfully mine.

                     NORA
             Just in case you forgot, you're a
             criminal and a scumbag.

                     RANDOLPH
             Okay, so maybe I commandeered a
             stray shekel or two. Big deal!
             Compared to what Smoochy did
             that's like jerking off in the
             supermarket.

                     NORA
             Where do you shop?

Randolph walks over and puts his hands on her shoulders.

                     RANDOLPH
             Come on. Have you lost all
             affection for me? After what we
             once had?

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                        65.

CONTINUED:

                     NORA
             That was a long time ago.    I was
             young and stupid.

                     RANDOLPH
             Why we broke up I'll never know.

                     NORA
             You turned into an asshole and I
             didn't love you.

                     RANDOLPH
             We could've worked through all
             that.

He leans in to kiss her and she shoves him away so
violently he almost falls over the coffee table.

                     RANDOLPH
             Damn it, Nora! The public is
             clamoring for me! I'm a fucking
             patriot! Mopes is a Nazi! He's
             evil! He's probably even gay!
             You should've seen the way he was
             checking me out in the car!

                     NORA
                (suddenly suspicious)
             What does that mean?

                     RANDOLPH
             What does what mean?

                     NORA
             You said he was checking you out
             in the car. What car?

                     RANDOLPH
             No... it's just a vibe! A Nazi
             homosexual vibe! It emanates from
             the television! The whole Smoochy
             costume... with the erect horn...
             I mean, what's that all about?

Nora starts to walk closer to him.       He backs up.

                     NORA
             You're talking awfully fast,
             Randolph.

                     RANDOLPH
             I still love you!   Let's go on a
             date!

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                         66.

                     NORA
             Were you at that rally? Tell me!
             Did you have something to do with
             this?

She backs him against the wall and looks him in the eye.

                     NORA
             Did you set Sheldon up?

Randolph just looks at her.

                      RANDOLPH
             You know, now I remember why we
             broke up. Always with the
             accusations. Bitch, bitch,
             bitch...

Nora hauls off and punches him in the jaw.


INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - NIGHT

A morose-looking Spinner Dunn sits alone at the end of
the bar in the nightclub. Tommy walks over.

                     TOMMY
             What's wrong, kid? The mayor of
             Patterson's here with his wife.
             They wanna meet ya.

                     SPINNER
             I don't wanna meet no one. I miss
             Smoochy! He never woulda done the
             things they say he done. He ain't
             no Nazi. Someone's making stuff
             up. I just know it, Tommy.
             Someone's making stuff up!

Spinner starts violently pounding his head on the bar,
causing GLASSES to RATTLE.

                      SPINNER
             I want Smoochy back! I want to be
             on TV again! I want to play my
             cowbell!

Nora enters the restaurant.    She looks around and
approaches Tommy.

                     NORA
             Hi, Tommy. Hi, Spinner.   Has
             Burke been in tonight?

                                       (CONTINUED)

             Damn it.

                     TOMMY
             Something I can help you with?

                      NORA
             I have to talk to him.    It's about
             Sheldon.

Spinner lifts his head from the bar.

                        SPINNER
             Sheldon?     What about Sheldon?


INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Randolph is napping on Angelo's couch with an ice pack on
his sore jaw thanks to Nora's fist. There is a sudden
LOUD POUNDING at the door. Randolph startles awake.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'm trying to sleep, asshole!
             Read the fucking meter some other
             time!

After a beat, the door is kicked open and Tommy and his
crew are standing there.

                     TOMMY
             You wanna tell me about the rhino?

                     RANDOLPH
             Hey, this is private property,
             creep! And you're trespassing!

                     TOMMY
             Danny, go give Mr. Smiley a little
             back rub.

Danny advances toward a shaking Randolph, fist clenched
and rolling up his sleeve.


RANDOLPH'S POV - DANNY

approaches. He cocks his arm and throws a punch.
Danny's fist FILLS the FRAME, TURNING IT BLACK as we hear
the PUNCH.

                                                        68.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - SERIES OF DISSOLVES - BEFORE DAWN

Newspaper trucks pull up to various newsstands and toss
out bundles of the morning editions. As each bundle
lands on the curb, we see headlines that span over the
next few days:


SMOOCHY SET UP - SMILEY BEHIND NAZI PLOT


PLANNED TO DESTROY RHINO'S REP


POLL:   RAINBOW RANDOLPH MOST HATED MAN IN AMERICA


PUBLIC OUTCRY:   "WE'RE SORRY SMOOCHY!"


EXT. POLICE PRECINCT - DAY

Randolph, bruised and battered, emerges from the police
station with his LAWYER. REPORTERS and photographers
rush forward.

                   REPORTER #1
           How does it feel to be voted the
           most hated man in America,
           Randolph?

                   RANDOLPH
           In a country like this, where your
           average citizen is a fuckin'
           Neanderthal, I wear it as a badge of
           honor.

                   REPORTER #2
           What about Ms. Bishop's charge that
           you have an unhealthy obsession
           with Sheldon Mopes?

                   RANDOLPH
           Listen, I barely know that broad.
           She's a wacko. An opportunist.
           I'm the most accused man since
           Jimmy Hoffa.

Someone throws an egg and it hits Randolph in the face.

                   RANDOLPH
              (on verge of tears)
           That was unfair! Who threw that?
           That was mean and uncalled for!

                                      (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

                     LAWYER
             My client is not answering any
             more questions. Between his
             dwindling cash flow and mounting
             legal bills he's sinking into a
             deep psychotic depression. Please
             stop antagonizing him. Thank you.

He pushes a sullen Randolph through the cluster of
people.


INT. BACKSTAGE - STUDIO C - DAY

A makeup woman dabs Sheldon's forehead as he's about to
go on. Nora stands next to him. A LOW TYMPANY ROLL is
heard from the stage.

                           SHELDON
                    (to Nora)
             I wouldn't be back here if it wasn't
             for you.

                           NORA
             I'm just sorry I didn't believe
             you... that I got swept up in the
             frenzy of anti-Smoochyism.

                           SHELDON
             Well, this town's a house of mirrors
             sometimes. It's hard to know what
             you're looking at.

He takes a couple of pre-show deep breaths.      A STAGEHAND
approaches.

                           STAGEHAND
             They're ready for you, Sheldon.

Sheldon exits backstage.


INT. STUDIO C - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The lights in the studio dim.

                      ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             Ladies and gentlemen... boys and
             girls...
                (dramatic pause)
             Who's your favorite rhino?

An explosion of enthusiasm from the kids in the
bleachers.

                     KIDS IN BLEACHERS
             Smoochy!!!

The lights come up as the Smoochyland Band plays a
strong, dramatic version of "Battle Hymn of the
Republic." After a moment, Smoochy slowly rises from a
lift under the stage. A giant sign above the jungle
lights up and emits a pyrotechnic shower of sparks. It
reads: WELCOME HOME SMOOCHY!


ANGLE ON SMOOCHYLAND BAND

A beaming Spinner Dunn enthusiastically bangs his cowbell
to the music as tears stream down his cheeks.


BACK ON SMOOCHY

He majestically stands center stage and nods to the kids
who are giving him a standing ovation. The song
crescendos with a rousing final chorus from the
Smoochyland Band who sing, "His truth is marching on!"

Thunderous applause from the bleachers. Smoochy walks
over to a stool and takes a seat. It's very quiet in the
studio now. Smoochy, looking uncharacteristically
serious, picks up a microphone as the lights go down.
He's in black limbo.

                     SMOOCHY
             Thank you. It's good to be back.
             You know, kids, sometimes life in
             the jungle can be unfair. A place
             where nice guys don't just finish
             last... they get their heads cut
             off.

Gasps from the bleachers.

                     SMOOCHY
             That pretty world you think you
             know is just props and scenery.
             Lollipop trees with roots in
             venom!

                     SMOOCHY
             So look around you, boys and
             girls. Every day. Be diligent!
             Stand strong! As the old proverb
             says: Beat a dog one time too
             many and you get a wolf! Let's
             start howling! Howl for me, boys
             and girls!

The kids in the bleachers howl along with Smoochy.

                     SMOOCHY
             Okay, I just wanted to get that
             off my chest. Who wants to do the
             Hokey-Pokey?!

The kids cheer as the Smoochyland Band launches into the
Hokey-Pokey song and Smoochy starts dancing. The kids
pour out of the bleachers onto the jungle set. Everyone
is dancing and having a ball. Nora is clapping to the
music offstage. Sheldon and Nora exchange affectionate
glances.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Randolph sits in front of the TELEVISION in a daze. He's
wearing a ratty bathrobe and absentmindedly tosses cheese
curls onto the floor from a bag on his lap. ON the TV,
an "Entertainment Tonight"-type show with two perky hosts
is covering Smoochy's return to the airwaves. The hosts,
Tara and Hunter show Smoochy's dynamic entrance and the
standing ovation he got during the taping that day.

                     TARA (V.O.)
             Well, Smoochy's back and boy did
             we miss him. Hundreds of well-
             wishers stood outside Kidnet
             Studios today hoping to catch a
             glimpse of their favorite rhino.

                     HUNTER (V.O.)
             That's right, Tara. Smoochy's
             popularity is stronger than ever
             thanks to his recent exoneration
             as a Nazi sympathizer. In fact,
             several movie studios are offering
             big bucks for a chance to bring
             the Smoochy story to the silver
             screen...
                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                           72.

CONTINUED:

The BROADCAST CONTINUES. Smoochy images flash across the
screen. Randolph has been mumbling the whole time.

                     RANDOLPH
                (quietly to himself)
             Bad... very bad... too much for
             brain... pressure building... ears
             ringing... eyes burning...
             contempt overflowing...

He jumps up and kicks the TV over.    He picks up a lamp
and starts beating the TV.

                     RANDOLPH
             I hate you! I fucking hate you!!!
             You devil-horned mind fucker!
             Die, die, die!!

Angelo, who was cooking in the kitchen, runs out.       He's
wearing an apron.

                     ANGELO
             What are you doing?! That's a
             Zenith!
                (notices cheese curls)
             Look at this place!

He grabs the lamp from Randolph.

                     ANGELO
             That's it! I want you out of
             here!

                     RANDOLPH
                (suddenly scared)
             Where am I supposed to go?

                     ANGELO
             I don't care!
                (pointing to door)
             Out!!


INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - NIGHT

Spinner's massive arms envelope Sheldon in a bear hug,
practically lifting him out of his seat. Burke, who's
having dinner with Sheldon, holds onto the table before
it gets knocked over.

                     SHELDON
             Easy, Spinner. Watch the ribs,
             buddy.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                            73.

CONTINUED:

                     SPINNER
             I missed you so much!

                           SHELDON
             I missed you too, champ.

He drops Sheldon and pulls out his cowbell.

                     SPINNER
             I've been practicing and
             practicing and I got real good,
             Sheldon. Real good!

He starts banging on it with a butter knife.      Sheldon
cringes.

                     SPINNER
             Wanna see me march?

                     SHELDON
             Sure, why not.

Spinner starts marching through the restaurant, clanging
the cowbell. People who are trying to eat their dinner
look annoyed. Sheldon sits back down at his table.

                     BURKE
             So you were saying you had some
             good news?

                     SHELDON
             Yes. Some very good news. After
             giving it a lot of thought... I've
             decided to do the ice show.

Burke gleefully slaps Sheldon on the shoulder.

                     BURKE
             Finally! I got me a bar mitzvah
             boy. Today you are a man!

                     SHELDON
             I realize now it's a sin to waste
             your power.

                     BURKE
             Like they say, rock bottom's a
             college education.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                     74.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             But here's the really good news:
             I'm doing it myself. No sponsors,
             no vendors, no crooks. Not one
             dirty hand will touch this. Not
             one person will make a dollar off
             these kids. Smoochy on Ice will
             be a study in purity.

Burke's grin suddenly fades.

                     SHELDON
             As far as food concessions go,
             I'll supply the refreshments. For
             free. Low sodium, whole wheat
             pretzels and apple slices. Healthy
             stuff. Now are you ready for the
             best part?

                     BURKE
             I'm holding my breath.

                     SHELDON
             All profits from ticket sales will
             be used to built a state-of-the-
             art methadone clinic in Coney
             Island.

Burke looks pale.

                     SHELDON
             I'm not just talking a run-of-the-
             mill clinic... I'm going to build
             a methadone palace. A place where
             men and women can withdraw in
             luxury.

                     BURKE
             Sheldon, you can't do an ice show
             and cut out the vendors. And more
             importantly, you can't cut out the
             Parade of Hope. It's suicide.

                     SHELDON
             You always told me, when you've
             got muscles you make the rules.
             Well, I'm feeling pretty strong
             right now.

Sheldon rises and tosses his napkin down.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                           75.

CONTINUED:

                     SHELDON
             All this time I was letting the
             business use me. Well, I think it's
             time I start using the business.
             I've got my clout back and I'm not
             gonna waste it this time. Take care
             of it, Burke.

Sheldon exits.    Burke sits there, looking very concerned.

On his way out the door, Tommy stops Sheldon.       Spinner's
COWBELL CLANGING continues.

                     TOMMY
             Shel, you gotta help me out. He
             bangs that goddamn thing from
             morning till night. I got a
             headache that goes from my eyes to
             my ass.

                     SHELDON
             Whatever I can do, Tommy, just say
             it. You know I love Spinner. And
             I owe you.

                     TOMMY
             Give the boy something else to do on
             the show. Anything. Just as long
             as it don't clang, chime or honk.

Chick, the Asian representative of Takashi, holds a

Sambo and Tobi start to advance on Stokes.

                     STOKES
             All right! I'll take care of it!
             I just need time!

Chick leans into Stokes' face.

                     CHICK
             One week, Jeeves. Got that? Or
             I get a blender and make an Orange
             Julius with your feet.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A down-and-out Randolph shuffles along in ratty bedroom
slippers. He passes a MAN who sits behind a small table
on the sidewalk. The table has a huge photograph of a
rhinoceros taped in front of it. Literature and
pamphlets depicting the black rhino are spread out on the
table.

                     MAN
             Save the rhino! Before it's too
             late! Make a donation! Save the
             rhino!
                (to Randolph)
             Hey, mister, ya wanna help save
             the rhino?

Randolph just looks at him for a moment. He looks at all
the rhino-related imagery. He starts shaking and
suddenly jumps over the table and attacks the Man.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'm the one who needs to be saved!
             Me. I'm broke! I lost my lawyer!
             My only friend kicked me out! I'm
             a fucking peanut shell in the
             shape of a man! Save the
             Rainbow! Save the Rainbow!
             Save the Rainbow!

                      MAN
             Help!   Someone call a cop!

Randolph grabs the collection can and runs off.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

It's a chilly, grey afternoon. Stokes and Burke walk along
the lake framed by the New York skyline.

                        STOKES
          Your client is suffocating me. To
          make matters worse, he's caused me
          to veer into a hazardous situation.
          A situation that otherwise could
          have a very happy ending.

                  BURKE
          Tell me more about the Asians.

                  STOKES
          They're ruthless. Unwavering.
          Unprincipled. And best of all,
          they know how the game is played.
          They respect our delicate
          ecosystem of mutual benefit.

Stokes stops walking and grabs Burke's arm.

                  STOKES
          I'd bring you in on this, Burke.
          You'd be my partner on the Takashi
          deal. Split down the middle. We
          have an opportunity to get back on
          track here. Back to the way it
          was.

                  BURKE
          The good old days.

                  STOKES
          Pre-rhinoceros.

The two men look at each other as thoughts pass silently
between them.

                  BURKE
          This is very sticky ground we're
          about to walk on.

                        STOKES
          Well, you're used to a little
          glue on your shoes.

Burke smiles.

                        BURKE
          Let me poke around. Sift through
          the possibilities.

EXT. ALLEY OFF ND STREET - THEATER STAGE DOOR -
EVENING

A slender young man in a Peter Pan costume in being held
by a big thug as another thug beats him up. A girl
dressed as Tinkerbell (also being restrained) looks on in
horror. Merv Green (Parade of Hope) steps INTO FRAME.

                  MERV
          This is what happens to guys who
          keep secrets, Johnny.

                  JOHNNY
          I'll give you the rest next week!
          I promise!

                  MERV
          It's not me you're fucking over,
          it's sick kids. You got something
          against sick kids, Johnny?

The thug punches him in the stomach again.

                   JOHNNY
          No!   I love sick kids!

Merv nods to one of the thugs who releases Peter Pan.   He
slumps to the ground. Merv kneels down and lifts his
head from the pavement.

                  MERV
          And you tell that fat producer of
          yours, if he ever gives me a low
          head count again, he'll lose the
          other thumb.

One of Merv's thugs leans in, whispers something to
Merv, who looks up to see.

Burke standing in the mouth of the alley.

Burke and Merv walk along 42nd Street. A poster
advertises Peter Pan "Sponsored by Parade of Hope --
Giving Children the Gift of Promise!" Merv's
thugs trail behind.

          show. No one. I don't care how
          many fucking clinics he's trying

          Look, I'm chokin' on the same bone

                  MERV
          If you're trying to aggravate me,
          you're doing a hell of a job.

                  BURKE
          I'm not here to aggravate, just

          He's got it in his head that he's

          surprised if he's wearing a wire.

Burke looks at his watch.

                  BURKE
          Jesus, I got a thing across town.

He steps off the curb to hail a cab.

                  BURKE
          Let's keep talking, Merv. There's
          oughta be some kind of solution.
          Don't you think?

Burke hops into a cab.   Merv watches the cab pull away.

                                                        80.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - OUTSIDE KIDNET BUILDING - TIGHT
SHOT - LEGS OF SMALL CARD TABLE - MORNING

SNAP open. The table is set on the sidewalk. A man's
legs ENTER the FRAME and shakily climb on top of the
table.


WIDER

Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the
Kidnet Building. He raises the megaphone to his mouth.

                        RANDOLPH
          Attention, New Yorkers! You are
          about to hear a shocking story
          of injustice!


WIDER

Randolph stands on the table directly in front of the
Kidnet Building.

                        RANDOLPH
          I urge you to listen! It has a
          surprise ending you won't want
          to miss!

A crowd starts to form on the sidewalk.

                        RANDOLPH
          It's the story of a venomous rhino
          and his aggressive campaign to
          slander, vilify, defame, denigrate
          and villainize my good name! But
          one thing he can't do, is take my
          life from me. No, friends, only I
          have the power to do that!

He reaches down and picks up a can of gasoline.

                             RANDOLPH
          This is what Smoochy has done to
          me! He's brought me to this! I
          can no longer live in a world
          where the innocent suffer and
          the wicked thrive!

Randolph raises the can over his head and pauses
dramatically.

                  RANDOLPH
          Where is God??!!

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           81.

CONTINUED:

He drenches himself with gasoline. The crowd grows
larger. He holds up a pack of matches.

                     RANDOLPH
             I'm sorry to do this, people.
             Don't try to talk me out of it.

The crowd starts to applaud.     Randolph looks baffled.

                      MAN IN CROWD
             Do it!   Light it!

                     RANDOLPH
             Our guest of honor will be here
             any moment! This is for his eyes!
             For his conscience. He'll have to
             live with this imagine for the
             rest of his miserable life!


INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon sits in the back of a limo on his way to work,
reading the paper. The headline blares: "SMOOCHY
ANNOUNCES ICE SHOW AT GARDEN." The subhead reads:
"ALL PROCEEDS TO BENEFIT BROOKLYN CLINIC."

                      SMOOCHY
                (to driver)
             Take it from me, Lester. Use your
             power. Don't squander it -- build
             with it.

                      LESTER
             Sound advice, Mr. Mopes. If I
             ever get any power I'll give that
             a whirl.
                (notices crowd
                 up ahead)
             Hey, what's going on up there?

Sheldon glances up from his paper.

                     SMOOCHY
                (casually)
             Looks like a street performer of
             some sort.

He goes back to his paper.


EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Randolph sees the Kidnet limo approaching.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                      82.

CONTINUED:

                     RANDOLPH
             This is it, folks! It's showtime!
             I'm sorry to do this, but he's
             left me no choice!

Randolph tries to light another match, but it's wet from
the gasoline. The crowd laughs and starts taunting him.

                     RANDOLPH
             Shut up, you hillbilly assholes!
             You're borough trash! Go back to
             your huts across the river!

Randolph keeps trying to light the match. Finally, after
several attempts, it lights. He holds it up. The crowd
burst into applause.

                     RANDOLPH
             Fuck you! Fuck all you people! I
             was the last of the Mohicans!
             You'll never see another Rainbow
             Randolph in this lifetime! You
             had me and you blew it! All of
             you!

He turns and faces the approaching limousine.

                     RANDOLPH
             This if for you, Smoochy!
             Remember this! As long as you
             live, remember this image! You
             did this to me!

He brings the match closer to his gasoline-soaked body.
The limo continues to approach. The crowd taunts him to
do it. He tries to bring the match closer, but his hand
is shaking. Suddenly, a LITTLE GIRL pushes through the
crowd. Everyone quiets down as she looks up at
Randolph.

                     LITTLE GIRL
             Whatcha doin', Rainbow Randolph?

Randolph freezes as he looks down at the Little Girl. A
slight look of hope comes over his face. She smiles
sweetly at him, walks over, and blows out the match.
Randolph is overcome with emotion. Just then, Sheldon's
LIMO WHOOSHES past him. The crowd cheers.

                           CROWD
             Smoochy!!!

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                         83.

CONTINUED:

They all run away from Randolph and over to Sheldon's
limo as it pulls in front of the Kidnet Building.
Randolph stares at them blankly. He looks down. The
Little Girl is gone. Sheldon gets out of the limo.
The crowd cheers him as he waves to them before going
inside.

A look of utter frustration now comes over Randolph.


OVERHEAD SHOT

Randolph drops to his knees on the table, looks skyward,
and screams.

                     RANDOLPH
             What does it all mean??!!

The CAMERA RISES ABOVE him as he lets out an anguished
howl that REVERBERATES through the skyscrapers.


INT. KIDNET STUDIOS - BACKSTAGE - TIGHT ON DISAPPOINTED
FACE OF SPINNER DUNN - DAY

                     SPINNER
             What do you mean I can't play the
             cowbell no more?


WIDER

Sheldon gently tries to break the news to Spinner who's
on the verge of tears.

                     SHELDON
             You're too talented for the
             cowbell, Spinner. Cowbells are
             for babies.

                     SPINNER
                (a little angry)
             I ain't no baby!

                     SHELDON
             That's right. You're a fully
             grown man. With whiskers... and
             scars... the whole sha-bang.
             That's why you deserve a bigger
             role on the show. A more
             important role...

Spinner's face starts to perk up.

                                                      84.

INT. STUDIO C - SHORT WHILE LATER

It's the middle of a Smoochy taping. Smoochy and the
Gang are wrapping up a song entitled, "My Stepdad's Not
Mean (He's Just Adjusting.)" The kids in the bleachers
are singing the chorus.

                        KIDS
          'Stepdads are people too/ They
          have bad days, like we all do/
          Be patient and help them through/
          Stepdads are people too...'

Smoochy continues the song.

                       SMOOCHY
             (singing)
          ... 'So three cheers for the man
          that I proudly call Stan... He's
          not quite a dad or a brother...
          Yes, he gets cross, but still he's
          the boss... And besides he takes
          care of my mother!'

The song ends. The kids in the bleachers applaud.
Smoochy addresses them.

                  SMOOCHY
          Remember, kids. First
          impressions, good or bad, are not
          always what they seem. Just like
          a new puppy, new dads need to
          adjust to their surroundings. So
          give 'em time! But always
          remember... if he becomes abusive
          to you or Mommy... what are the
          magic numbers?

                  KIDS IN BLEACHERS
             (shouting in unison)
          Nine-One-One!

                  SMOOCHY
          Right-o-riffic!

The Smoochyland Band plays a little fanfare.

                  SMOOCHY
          And now, boys and girls, I have a
          special surprise. I'd like to
          introduce the newest member of the
          Magic Jungle... my cousin...
          Moochy the Rhino!

                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         85.

CONTINUED:

The Smoochyland Band plays a happy little song as Spinner
Dunn, in costume as Moochy, runs on stage. The Moochy
costume is identical to Smoochy only it's a darker
orange instead of bright orange.

                     SMOOCHY
             Howdy, Moochy! Welcome to the
             Jungle! You wanna say howdy to
             the kids?

Spinner freezes.       He stares at the camera.

                       SMOOCHY
             Moochy?

                     SPINNER
             My name is Moochy.

                     SMOOCHY
             That's right. We've established
             that.

                     SPINNER
                (leaning into Sheldon)
             Sheldon, this costume's makin' my
             nuts itch.

Sheldon looks horrified. The Smoochyland Band quickly
launches into some music. Smoochy, Moochy and a few
other jungle animals begin to dance. Moochy's lumbering
movements are in stark contrast to the choreographed
steps of the others. As a bonus, he occasionally
scratches his crotch.


INT. SHELDON'S DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

A happy Spinner (still in costume as Moochy) pokes his
head into Sheldon's dressing room. Sheldon, still in
costume as well, looks drained after the difficult
taping.

                     SPINNER
             That was fun! Was it bad when I
             done that thing, where I tripped
             and knocked over the Flamingo and
             then he knocked over the cameraman
             and then those lights fell down on
             that lady's head?

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                        86.

                     SHELDON
             It's fine, Spinner. We'll edit it
             out. But tomorrow in rehearsal
             we're gonna work on a new thing
             called 'the importance of hitting
             your mark.'

                       SPINNER
             Great!    I get to hit something!

Spinner dances off. A beat later, Nora enters and shuts
the door. There's an awkward beat of silence.

                       NORA
             Hi.

                       SHELDON
             Hi.

                     NORA
             I read about the ice show.

                     SHELDON
             Yeah, the papers seem to be really
             covering it.

                     NORA
             I think it's great. What you're
             doing for that clinic.

                       SHELDON
             Thanks.

She nods.

                     NORA
             I just need some clarification...

                           SHELDON
             Don't worry. Spinner just needs
             a little more rehearsal. I'll get
             him there.

                           NORA
             No I mean about us.

Sheldon looks uncomfortable.

                           NORA
             Ever since you've been back I just
             feel like there's something that's
             not connecting.

             I guess I'm still readjusting a
             little. Like a guy who's come
             back from the war. Not that I'd
             equate my misfortune with the

             brave men and women who protect
             us overseas.

                           NORA
             I just thought we were on our way
             to something... granted, my
             mistaken belief that you had ties
             to Neo-Nazis might have put a
             damper on our relationship, but
             I'm sorry for --

Sheldon suddenly jumps up and grabs her. He kisses her
passionately. Nora immediately starts ripping off his
costume as they make out. They fall to the floor in
a lustful embrace.


INT. STUDIO - BACK HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Spinner, humming to himself, lumbers down the hallway on
his way to the wardrobe room. Halfway down the hall, he
hears a voice call out to him.

                     VOICE (O.S.)
             Hey -- rhino.

Spinner turns around. The door to the fire exit swings
open. Two of Merv's thugs emerge and grab Spinner (who's
still in full Moochy costume) and drag him into the
stairwell.


INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MOMENT LATER

Spinner is dragged into the garage and knocked to the
pavement. Several more thugs emerge from the shadows,
including Henry, Merv's main henchman. They start
beating him with lead pipes. Henry pulls out a REVOLVER.
He SHOOTS the rhino several times. A sedan trunk is
popped open and Moochy is thrown inside. The CAR
SCREECHES up to the street.


INT. CHINATOWN - NIGHT

We CRANE DOWN FROM a Chinese banner that stretches across
two tenements. We LAND ON the seedy, deserted street
below as the SEDAN BARRELS INTO FRAME and SQUEALS to a
stop.

CONTINUED:

Two thugs emerge from the car. They pull Spinner/Moochy
from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans,
knocking a few over. They get back in the car and speed
away. Moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter
and lays motionless. Blood seeps through his foamy
torso.


LOW OVERHEAD SHOT

of Spinner/Moochy. We SLOWLY START TO RISE UP as we LOOK
DOWN AT the rhino's body. The WIND WHISTLES through the
empty street as we get HIGHER. The Chinese banner
rustles THROUGH the FRAME. As we get HIGHER AND HIGHER,
we hear the intermittent CLANG of a PRIZE FIGHT BELL.

An enraged Merv Green glares at his henchmen, Henry and
MITCH.

             identical.

                     MERV
             Smoochy is bright orange, Moochy
             is burnt rust! Read the papers!
             Do I gotta take you back to

                     MITCH
             All you said was 'hit the rhino.'
             You never specified the color.
             I'm not taking the blame for this
             one.

Merv's anger builds. He turns to a picture of Smoochy
which is tacked to a bulletin board along with other kid
show personalities that the foundation extorts. Merv
picks up a letter opener and violently thrusts it into
the picture.

                           MERV

Cops rummage through Angelo's apartment. In the b.g.,

detective, McCALL, is looking through some papers he
found.

             Ellie, over here.

Ellis walks over. McCall shows him some scribblings he's
found in a notebook of Randolph's. The crude drawings
depict Smoochy with his head cut off... with a knife in
his heart... being pissed on by Randolph, etc. "Die,
Rhino, Die" is scrawled hundreds of times, filling page
after page. The two detectives look at each other and
nod.


INT. SPINNER DUNN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Spinner sleeps forever in an open casket, clutching his
cowbell. Dozens of Spinner's relatives are at the wake.

CONTINUED:

A bagpipe player plays "Amazing Grace." Sheldon stands
at the casket, fighting back tears as he stares down at
his old friend. Nora has her arm around him.

                           SHELDON
             It's my fault. He'd still be
             alive if it wasn't for me. He
             would have been so proud to be in
             the ice show.

                     NORA
             There was nothing you could have
             done. Don't torture yourself.

                     SHELDON
             I'm sorry, Spinner.   I'm so sorry.

Tommy and the boys walk over. Tommy puts his arm around
Sheldon as he gazes somberly at Spinner.

                     TOMMY
             He really loved you, Shel. And
             this I guarantee -- that fucking
             Randolph has seen his last
             rainbow. We're gonna find him,
             cut off his balls, and shove 'em
             up his ass.

                     SHELDON
             Maybe you better leave it to the
             police.

                     DANNY
             They won't do the ball thing.
             It's against procedure.

                     TOMMY
             Don't forget -- that hit was meant
             for you, Shel. So from now on,
             everywhere you go, we go.

                     SHELDON
             That's okay, Tommy.   I'll be fine.

                     TOMMY
             Fine, nothin'. And as Christ is
             my witness, no one's touchin' a
             hair on your fuckin' head.
             Spinner would have wanted it that
             way.

Tommy's crew nods and agrees.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                          91.

                     TOMMY
                (to the boys)
             Alright, boys, let's get shit-
             faced. For Spin.

They head for the bar.    Nora and Sheldon look down at
Spinner in silence.

                     SHELDON
             Didn't Rickets the Hippo have a
             song about death?

                     NORA
             'The Last Nappy Time.' It gave me
             a lot of comfort when my mother
             died.
                (sings quietly)
             'When doggies stop barking
             And fish cease to swim
             And Grandpa lays silent, from his
               head to his limbs
             Sadness will find you
             But soon you'll feel fine...'

Sheldon joins in.

                     SHELDON/NORA
             'In life we all have
             Our Last Nappy Time.'

Sheldon looks at her.    They embrace as BAGPIPE MUSIC
SWELLS.

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

The news zipper in Times Square glides through the night
air: "MANHUNT UNDERWAY FOR RAINBOW RANDOLPH... SUSPECTED
IN BOXER'S MURDER... SEEN OUTSIDE BUILDING SHORTLY BEFORE
SHOOTING, DRENCHED IN GASOLINE AND ACTING PECULIAR..."

We CRANE DOWN FROM the zipper ONTO the sidewalk.
Randolph is talking on a pay phone. We hear Angelo on
the other end.

                           RANDOLPH
             I didn't do it! I know you're
             still mad at me, but you gotta
             believe me.

             The papers say you were the
             mastermind.

                           RANDOLPH
             Mastermind? I can barely figure
             out how to unzip my pants these
             days. Just taking a piss is a
             logistical nightmare.

                           ANGELO (V.O.)
             I believe you, Randy. But you
             can't come back to my place.
             They'll find you. You gotta go
             underground.


EXT. LIBERTY FLOUR AND BISCUIT FACTORY - NIGHT

We are outside the long-abandoned Liberty Biscuit and
Flour factory. The Liberty sign with its Statue of
Liberty logo is eroded and partially missing.


INT. LIBERTY BISCUIT AND FLOUR FACTORY - CONTINUOUS
ACTION

Inside the massive dormant factory, rats scurry around
and pigeons occasionally fly from window sill to window
sill. A makeshift living area has been set up in the
middle of it all -- a chair, lamp, small table, hot
plate, etc. Randolph lays on the dilapidated conveyor
belt, huddled under a blanket.

Angelo enters the factory through a rusty door, carrying
provisions.

                     ANGELO
             It's heatin' up out there. Every
             cop in New York is looking for
             you. And Tommy Cotter's boys are
             combin' the streets. You're gonna
             have to stay put for a while.

Randolph sits up on the conveyor belt, blanket draped
over his shoulders. He's a physical and emotional wreck.

                     RANDOLPH
             I was an altar boy once. Did you
             know that? I wanted to be a
             priest. Do you believe in angels,
             Angie?

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                      93.

                       ANGELO
             Angels?

                     RANDOLPH
             There was a little angel in
             pigtails. She was the only one
             who cared about me. She saved my
             life.

Angelo hops up on the conveyor belt to console Randolph.
Randolph rests his head on Angelo's shoulder.

                     ANGELO
             You didn't want to kill yourself,
             Randy. You know that.

                     RANDOLPH
             Perhaps it's time to heal. To
             accept the fact that Smoochy has
             won and gracefully march forward.
             True, I'm currently wanted for a
             murder I didn't commit. But I
             have faith. Faith that justice
             will prevail.

                     ANGELO
             Now you're talkin', kid. This is
             a big step... I'm proud of you.

He strokes Randolph's head.

                     RANDOLPH
             Did you bring lunch?

                       ANGELO
             Yes.

                     RANDOLPH
             Chicken and stars?

                     ANGELO
             Just like you asked for.

                     RANDOLPH
             Can I have some, please?

                     ANGELO
             For a smile.

Randolph sniffs and manages a small pitiful smile.
Angelo musses his hair.

                     ANGELO
             Atta boy.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                          94.

CONTINUED:

Angelo lifts one of the grocery bags onto the conveyor
belt.

                     ANGELO
             Here, I got you some crossword
             puzzles and stuff to read.

Angelo hops off the conveyor belt and turns on the hot
plate. He starts to open a can of soup. Randolph
reaches into the bag and pulls out a copy of the New York
Post. The lead article's headline reads, "WAKE FOR
SPINNER." A large photograph shows mourners leaving the
restaurant after the wake. Clearly visible are Sheldon
and Nora. They have their arms around each other.
Randolph's eyes widen. He starts to hyperventilate.
Angelo looks up.

                     ANGELO
             You okay? Randy?

Finally, Randolph expels a blood-curdling scream that
ECHOES through the factory.

                     RANDOLPH
             Motherfucker!!!!!!!

Angelo drops the soup.      Birds in the factory flutter from
the rafters.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ICE RINK

Sheldon and the Rhinettes work on some choreography for
that night's show. Nora watches from the sidelines. As
Sheldon skates on the ice rink, Merv enters with Roy and
Danny. Sheldon skates over to them. Nora walks over,
too.

                           TOMMY
             Big news, Shel.

                            SHELDON
             What's that?

                           TOMMY
             It wasn't Smiley who killed
             Spinner. It was Parade of Hope.

                            NORA
             Merv Green?

                           SHELDON
             Are you sure? The cops have tons
             of evidence on Randolph.

FLASHBACK - INT. SPINNER DUNN'S - DAY

Tommy is at the bar listening intently to a man, IAN,
who is pointing to certain details on a photograph.

                           IAN
             See the neck? Snapped like a
             twig. Animals... Parade of Hope's
             calling card. When they do a guy,
             they like to sign the tab.

                     TOMMY
             What's that guy's name over there?
             Green?

                                 LEON
             Yeah, Merv Green.

                           TOMMY
             This was one time they shoulda
             left the tab blank.


INT. ICE RINK (PRESENT)

                           NORA
             I knew Merv Green was a scumbag
             from the day he grabbed my ass at
             a 'Feed the Children' benefit.

                           SHELDON
             Well, God help those guys now.
             They're gonna get a first-class
             ride through the criminal justice
             system, and I'm buying the
             tickets.

                           TOMMY
             It's all taken care of, Shel.

                           SHELDON
             What does that mean?

                                                        96.

FLASHBACK - INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

A bloodied Merv Green is tied to a chair in the middle
of the warehouse as he begs Tommy for his life. Merv's
two henchmen lay dead nearby. Roy, Jimmy and Sammy --
Tommy's guys -- stand behind her.

                  MERV
          It was a mistake! An honest
          mistake! All I'm trying to do is
          help children.

                  TOMMY
          You like kids, huh?

                   MERV
          Yes!   Of course!

                  TOMMY
          So you must know a few fairy
          tales. Danny, tell him the one
          about the worthless prick who gets
          his head chopped off.

Danny, holding a hatchet, advances toward Merv. Tommy
casually walks away. We STAY WITH Tommy. Merv is NO
LONGER IN FRAME.

                  MERV (O.S.)
          No... no... no!

He SCREAMS.

We hear the sound of the HATCHET HITTING its target.
Merv's pleading stops.

                  TOMMY
          Now you know why charities go
          under sometimes.

          A clean cut.

             Thank you! Specifics about his
             head are superfluous at this
             point.


INT. STOKES' OFFICE - EVENING

Nora is alone in Stokes' office, rearranging cards on
the giant cork board that displays the network schedule.
She is startled to hear a deep voice behind her.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
             Where is he?

She turns around. Chick, Tobi, and Sambo are standing
there. Chick walks over to the cork board. He scans a
row of cards that all read "Smoochy."

                           NORA
                    (attitude)
             Can I help you with something?

             Yeah, honey, you can help us
             with something...

He rips a Smoochy index card from the board, walks over
to her and waves it in her face.

                           CHICK
             You tell that boss of yours he
             better take care of the rhino
             problem. In my culture we honor
             deals or invite consequences.

                           NORA
             I don't know what you're talking
             about and your cologne's making
             me nauseous. Other than that,
             you're great company.

Chick looks at his boys and chuckles.

                           CHICK
             Spicy little thing, isn't she?

                                           (CONTINUED)

He suddenly pulls out a switchblade and holds it to
Nora's throat.

                           CHICK
             Takashi gets that time slot. You
             hear me, girly? Tell that boss of
             yours we'll kill everyone at this
             fucking network if we have to.
             Starting with the pretty ones.

He removes the knife from her throat and hurls it toward
the bulletin board. It lands -- sticking right in the
middle of a Smoochy card.

                           CHICK
             Auf Wiedersehen, honey.

They exit.


INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

Nora is pacing.    Sheldon sits by the fire.

                     NORA
             It's Stokes. He's behind the
             whole thing! He cut some kind of
             deal for the Smoochy slot!

                     SHELDON
             What are you talking about?

                     NORA
             He wants you out so he can put
             Takashi in!

                     SHELDON
             Who's Takashi?

                           NORA
             Jesus, Sheldon! Don't you ever
             pick up a copy of International
             Performer? He's the hottest kid
             show host from Asia.

Sheldon's head is swimming. Suddenly the front door to
to the penthouse bursts open. Randolph, dressed like
he's about to do his old show, stumbles in waving a gun.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                           RANDOLPH
             Ah! How very cozy. Like two logs
             in a little bonfire. All we need
             is a few sticks and some wienies.

He almost trips as he stumbles over to Sheldon.      He
waves the gun in his face.

                           RANDOLPH
             I had her before you! Pachyderm!
             I was in love with her! In love!
             And you snatched her away! Like
             a common thief! You're the bad
             guy! Not me! He's the bad guy,
             Nora. He's incapable of
             understanding the love we once
             had! Tender, yet passionate.
             Old-fashioned, yet experimental.
                    (cackles)
             Tell him about a few of our

Sheldon looks stunned.    Nora hangs her head.

                            SHELDON
                    (to Nora)
             Is this true? Please tell me it's
             just the confused ramblings of a
             diseased mind.

She looks at him, but doesn't say anything.

                           SHELDON
             Holy mother of Toledo. When
             exactly were you planning to let
             me know about this?!

                           NORA
                    (turns to Sheldon)
             Listen, there was a time -- and
             I'm not proud of this -- but there
             was a time when I was a bit of
             a... kiddie-host groupie.

                           RANDOLPH
             You're just another action figure
             for her collection!

                           NORA
             That's not fair!

                           RANDOLPH
             Tell him about Jingle Jackson!

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                          100.

                           SHELDON
             You dated Jingle Jackson?

                           RANDOLPH
             The bells turned her on. Hey,
             tell him about Jumbo Johnny!
             There's a tale for ya! A whale
             of a tale!

She looks down, somewhat ashamed.      A look of utter shock

comes over Sheldon.

                           SHELDON
             Oh good Lord in Heaven.

                           NORA
             Look, what I did before I met you
             is none of your business.

                            RANDOLPH
             Shut up!   Both of you! This is
             my show!

He waves the gun threateningly as he backs up to an
armchair and sits down.

                                RANDOLPH
             Do you fully understand the power
             of a condemned man? Do you? I'm
             already wanted for one murder, why
             should I give a flaming horse's
             twat if I commit two more?

                           SHELDON
             I... uh... read once that the best
             way to diffuse a tense situation
             is with a little humor. To that
             end, would you like to hear a
             funny joke?

                            RANDOLPH
                     (rolling his eyes)
             Oh, please. Go blow yourself,
             Martha.
                     (waves gun again)
             Fix me a beverage, woman. Make me
             one of those drinks that used to
             make us all warm and fuzzy before
             bouncy-bouncy time!

                           NORA

             Remember, I have Mr. Boomy.

                           SHELDON
             I'm telling you, you'd love this
             joke. It revolves around Santa
             Claus and the Easter Bunny getting
             into a fender bender.

Nora rolls her eyes and goes to the bar.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (to Sheldon)
             You know, when I lived here I used
             to have a big painting above the
             fireplace. A naked chick holding
             a pumpkin. It was very tasteful.
             No bush...

                           NORA
             Look, Randolph. We know it
             wasn't you who killed Spinner.

                           SHELDON
             We'll go to the police, first
             thing tomorrow... straighten
             everything out.

                                          RANDOLPH
             Oh!  Goody-goody gumdrops!
                    (to Nora)
             Vodka straight up is fine, sugar
             babe!

He grabs the bottle out of her hand. He rises from the
chair. He takes a CD, "PARTY TIME WITH RAINBOW
RANDOLPH," from his pocket and puts it into an
audio system on the fireplace wall.

                           RANDOLPH
             Did you put on a little weight,
             honey? That's okay, you're still
             a hot little brood mare. I bet
             you miss the sweet sting of my
             riding crop. Giddy up, pony!

The THEME SONG from his show starts to PLAY. He flicks
a switch and a spotlight goes on. He sings and dances.

                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                       102.

                (to tune of
                 'Ol' MacDonald)
             'Rainbow Randolph is the man.
             Yes he, yes he, is.
             He's the Prez of Rainbowland.
             Yes he, yes he, is.
             With some fun, fun here, and a
               laugh, laugh there.
             Here a dance, there a song,
             Everything is fun, fun.
             Rainbow Randolph is the King, the
               King of Rainbowland!'

Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle.
Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab
the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the
floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He
screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace.

                     SHELDON
             Is this what you want? A Hansel
             and Gretel ending?! You want to
             be the big bad wolf?

                     RANDOLPH
             Stop! It's too hot!    The heat!
             It's driving me mad!

Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a
fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph
cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points
it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a
child. He's bleeding.

                     RANDOLPH
             Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off.
             My life's over anyway. Everything
             I touch turns to shit. Put me out
             of my misery.

Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head.

                     SHELDON
             You're not nothing. You're
             bitter, misguided and I'm guessing
             a raging alcoholic, but you're
             still Rainbow Randolph. Despite
             everything that's happened, you
             once made children happy.

Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery
eyes.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                         103.

             Would you be my friend?

                        SHELDON
             Sure.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (to Nora)
             You too?

                              NORA
             I guess.

                           RANDOLPH
             Sorry about the brood mare stuff.

Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into
his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at
Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy.

Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from
one of the chairs. She kneels next to Randolph and blots
the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow.
Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream.

WIDER

Sheldon loads his gun as Randolph is curled up on the
couch like a little puppy. Nora hands him a cup of tea.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (a pitiful child)
             Thank you.

She walks over to Sheldon.

                           NORA
                    (re: gun)
             What are you doing?

Sheldon continues to load the gun.

             Just making the playing field
             even. I'm tired of running this
             race with one leg.

                           NORA
             You're letting them drag you down

                    (from couch)
             She's right, Sheldon. Don't make
             the same mistakes I did. Keep
             your dignity intact.

He accidentally spills some hot tea on himself.

                           RANDOLPH
             Son-of-a-bitch!

                           SHELDON
             I appreciate everyone's concern,
             but I can take care of myself.

Nora and Randolph look at each other.

                           RANDOLPH
                    (mouthing to Nora)
             I tried.

Sheldon stuffs some extra bullets in his pocket.

                     SHELDON
                    (to Randolph)
             Okay, buddy, we have to get down
             to the Garden. You're welcome to
             stay here as long as you like.
             Just don't leave until I get
             things squared away.

Randolph gets up and walks over to him.

                                RANDOLPH
             Be careful, Sheldon. Remember
             what I told you -- you've only
             scratched the surface of this
             scummy business. You have yet to
             strike oil.

Randolph looks at him for a moment before turning to
Nora.

                           NORA
             You just rest, Randolph.

                     RANDOLPH
             He's the real thing. Smoochy's the
             real thing. And I've been a fraud.
             A wicked man doing wicked acts.

Sheldon slaps the cylinder into place and tucks the gun
in his waistband.

                     SHELDON
             Well, we all have our bad days.

He exits.


INT. HAWAII KAI - LATER THAT EVENING

A hula dancer performs on a tiny stage in the nightclub.
A small Hawaiian string band plays behind her. Burke
and a nervous-looking Stokes sit in a booth.

                           STOKES
             Things are getting out of hand.
             We have to cover our tracks.

             Relax, everything's gonna work
             out.

                           STOKES
             Relax? They found Merv Green's
             head on the Grand Concourse!
             Excuse my concern.

                           BURKE
             Look, we can cover all the tracks
             we want, but in the end we still
             got the same problem. We gotta
             finish what we started.

                              STOKES
             God help us...

Stokes shakily takes a sip of his drink.

                           STOKES
             Buggy? Buggy Ding-Dong? The guy
             who hosted 'Buggy's Bumpy
             Railroad'?

                           STOKES
             Yeah, until he discovered the joys
             of Turkish black mule heroin. For
             the right price he'll do anything.
             It's amazing the guy's still alive.

Stokes buries his head in his hands.

                           STOKES
             I don't know, Burke... this whole
             thing...

A shadow falls across their table.    Burke looks up.

                           BURKE
             Speak of the devil. Have a seat,
             Bug.

Buggy Ding-Dong's hand ENTERS the FRAME and snubs out his
Camel. Stokes looks up.

                           STOKES
                    (attempting to
                     sound cheerful)
             Buggy. You're looking good.



ANGLE ON BUGGY

A man who looks like he would first kill you then eat you
for dinner, slides into the booth next to Stokes.

                           BURKE
             It's time we put this thing to
             rest, Frank. And the way I see
             it... the rhino's up past his
             bedtime.

Burke hands a folded envelope to Buggy who puts it into
his jacket pocket. He lights another Camel.

INT. ANGELO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Angelo's place looks like a cyclone hit it. Angelo
works free from the ropes that have bound his wrists.
He has been hit over the head and is groggy as he
reaches for the phone.


INT. SHELDON'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

A freshly showered Randolph is wearing Sheldon's robe and
has a pink towel wrapped around his head as he lounges on
the living room sofa. He's eating grapes and reading
National Geographic. The PHONE RINGS. He picks it up.

                   RANDOLPH
             (sing-songy)
          Hellooo!

We GO TO a SPLIT-SCREEN with Angelo.

             Buggy Double D's?   The Dong Man?

                      ANGELO
             Yeah, he lifted my backstage pass
             and he's braggin' that he's
             doing some kind of job for Burke
             Bennett.

Randolph thinks.    He suddenly looks very worried.

                     RANDOLPH
             Sheldon's in trouble.   I gotta get
             down to the Garden.

                     ANGELO
             The place is crawling with cops.
             They'll jump on you like a
             trampoline.

                     RANDOLPH
             I don't care.

He rips the towel from his head.

                     RANDOLPH
             I have to warn the rhino.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - BASEMENT

Buggy, in his ill-fitting Rhinette costume, emerges from
the sub-basement carrying a thin suitcase. As far as
anyone's concerned, he's just another usher. He heads
for the stairwell.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Every seat in the arena is occupied. The lights are
lowered. A slow rolling TYMPANY is heard. After a
moment, the Rhinettes skate out to enthusiastic applause.

                                                      109.

BACKSTAGE

Sheldon, looking very intense, stands alone in the wings.
He takes a couple of deep breaths. We TILT DOWN and see
the bulge of the revolver under his Smoochy costume.


ICE RINK

The Rhinettes have formed a line across the middle of the
rink.

                    ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
            And now... it gives us great
            pleasure to introduce America's
            favorite rhino... ladies and
            gentlemen... boys and girls...
               (dramatic pause)
            Heeeeere's Smoochy!

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause. The entire
arena is on its feet. The Rhinettes part as Smoochy
skates through them and stops in the middle of the rink.
The applause and cheering don't stop for several moments.
One of the Rhinettes hands Smoochy a microphone.

                    SMOOCHY
            On behalf of myself, the
            Rhinettes, and the soon to be
            restored Coney Island Methadone
            Center, I thank you all for
            coming.


NETWORK BOX

Burke and Stokes roll their eyes.


BACK ON SHELDON

                    SMOOCHY
            It was my original intention that
            tonight's performance would be a
            benign mix of Smoochy songs and
            ice dancing. But as an artist, I
            believe I must convey to you, my
            fans, what I'm feeling at any
            given moment in my life. To do
            otherwise would be dishonest. Art
            is communication. It's something
            we learn and hopefully grow from.
            With that in mind... I hope you
            enjoy the show.

                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                         110.

CONTINUED:

More applause as Smoochy skates over to the Rhinettes.
They form a circle around him and slap hands in
solidarity.

                     SHELDON
             This is for Spinner.

The lights go down. A full orchestra begins to play the
overture to WAGNER's Tristen et Isolde. The lights come
up as a soprano -- a heavyset woman in a modified rhino
costume -- skates out through the fog and begins singing
the opera. Smoochy -- now wearing a peasant's frock --
skates an interpretive dance in the b.g. with a few
Rhinettes who are also dressed as peasants. A beautiful
fairy princess floats down (on filament wire) from the
rafters and takes Smoochy's hand. She skates away with
him as he waves good-bye to the Rhinettes.


HIGH ANGLE

LOOKING DOWN AT the opera. The CAMERA PANS OVER TO the
catwalk high above the rink.


CATWALK

Buggy Ding-Dong, still in his Rhinette costume, settles
into his assassin's roost. He begins to assemble the
rifle and check the scope.


EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

Randolph emerges from a cab and runs through the crowd
outside the Garden. A few people recognize him.

                     MAN
             It's Rainbow Randolph!   Someone
             stop him!

Randolph finds a side exit and slips into the arena.


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - FEW MINUTES LATER

The "Opera on Ice" continues. The soprano continues
singing as Smoochy reenacts the incidents of his recent
life. The fairy princess brings Smoochy to a room with a
gleaming white desk. Smoochy takes a seat behind the
desk. The fairy princess places a crown on his head,
bids him good-bye, and floats away. Smoochy sits proudly
in his new world.

                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                        111.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, Rhinettes dressed as devils glide in and skate
in a circle around the desk. They throw money at Smoochy.
He jumps up and skates away, but the Rhinette devils
pursue him with daggers. The music from the orchestra
intensifies as the drama plays out.


NETWORK BOX

Nora continues to watch the opera, totally entranced.
Stokes and Burke look a little on edge. Burke glances at
his watch.


CATWALK

Buggy finishes loading the rifle. He shines the barrel
with his sleeve and looks through the scope as Smoochy
and company continue to perform below.


POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

Atmospheric fog created by the smoke machine is so thick
that Buggy has difficulty FINDING Sheldon THROUGH the
cross-hairs. Occasionally, Smoochy skates through a hole
in the clouds only to disappear again. BUGGY CURSES in
frustration.


ARENA

Randolph pushes his way past Garden security and runs
toward the rink. Several cops working the event spot
him. A few spectators scream in horror.


ICE RINK

The soprano's mournful aria reaches its crescendo as
Smoochy is now pursued by Rhinettes dressed as Nazis.
They hold signs with words like "SCANDAL" and "SHAME."
Smoochy skates to a section of the rink resembling
Chinatown where he lands over a fallen "Moochy." He
cradles Moochy's head in his arms as the Nazis glide past
him and disappear into the fog.


NETWORK BOX

Nora wipes a tear from her eye as she watches the tragedy
play out. Burke and Stokes glance skyward. Nora notices
this.

                                                         112.

RINK'S EDGE

Randolph reaches the rink as cops push their way toward
him.

                     RANDOLPH
             Sheldon!!!

But Sheldon can't hear over the orchestra.   The soprano
hits a high note.


CATWALK

Buggy aims the rifle.


POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

Smoochy glides THROUGH the cross-hairs followed by a
Rhinette.


TIGHT ON BUGGY'S FINGER

as he quickly squeezes off a SHOT.


RINK

The MUFFLED sound of GUNSHOT is absorbed by the intense
music. A wounded Rhinette falls to the ice, but no one
notices. Smoochy, oblivious, continues to skate toward
the "gates of heaven" with the angel Moochy. Giant white
gates slowly swing open at the rink's far end as floating
angels open their arms to welcome Moochy.


OUTER RINK

Randolph runs around the rink's perimeter, trying to get
Sheldon's attention. Cops and security push their way
towards Randolph. He suddenly notices the felled
Rhinette on the ice and looks skyward. He can make out
a rifle barrel protruding from the catwalk.


NETWORK BOX

Stokes and Burke notice a commotion in the audience.
They now see Randolph running through the crowd on his
way to the stairwell.

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        113.

                     STOKES
                (whispering to Burke)
             What's he doing here?! He's going
             to screw everything up!

Nora notices the distressed look on their faces and
follows their gaze to the rafters. She now sees the
rifle barrel.


ANGLE - NORA

jumps to her feet.      FAST PUSH IN TO Nora's mouth.

                     NORA
                (screaming)
             Sheldon!!!

She starts to climb out of the box but Burke stops her.

                       BURKE
             Nora...

                     NORA
             You're in on this, aren't you!
             You sold him out! You fucking
             snake!

Stokes tries to put his arm around her.

                     STOKES
             Nora, please. It's not what you
             think. I'm grooming you. You're
             going to run the division one
             day...

She pushes him. He goes down hard. She starts to climb
out of the box. Burke tries to grab her, but she spins
around and punches him. She runs for the rink.

Stokes stands in the box looking dumbstruck as pande-
monium plays out around him. People are running in all
directions, cops are everywhere.

                     STOKES
                (frightened; to Burke)
             What now? What do we do now?!

                     BURKE
             Survival of the fittest!

Burke runs off through the panicked crowd. Stokes looks
around and heads off in the opposite direction.

                                                      114.

OUTSIDE RINK

Tommy and her boys notice the commotion in the audience.
They see cops pursuing someone. They realize it's
Randolph. Tommy, Jimmy and Sammy take off after him.


CATWALK

Buggy, in position again, looks through the rifle scope.


POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

As the soprano reaches for an impossibly high note, the
fog dissipates slightly and Smoochy's foam rubber head
COMES perfectly INTO VIEW.


BUGGY

smiles.


RINK'S EDGE

Nora screams.

                  NORA
          Sheldon!!! Get down!!!


CLOSE ON BUGGY'S FINGER

He's about to squeeze the trigger.


CATWALK

Randolph reaches the catwalk as the orchestra plays a
dramatic series of smashing notes. He tackles Buggy just
as he squeezes off the SHOT.


RINK

The top of Smoochy's foam rubber head is blown off. In
SLOW MOTION, Smoochy's tattered horn sails through the
air and lands softly on the ice.


WIDE

Everyone in the arena screams and heads for the exits.
It's pandemonium. Thanks to Randolph, Buggy's shot was
too high and just missed Sheldon's skull.

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         115.

CONTINUED:

A confused Sheldon bends over to pick up a chunk of the
Smoochy head.

Nora, who's entered at the opposite end of the rink,
tries to reach him, but it's impossible. Panicked
audience members run across the rink, heading for the
exits. It's chaos. People slip, Rhinettes get trampled.


CATWALK

Randolph tries to get the rifle away from Buggy. They
struggle on a narrow beam high above the rink. The cops
have reached the outer edge of the catwalk now. Tommy
and the boys get there a second later. They all stand
back -- the catwalk is too unstable.

                     RANDOLPH
             Give me that gun, you fucking
             wacked-out freak!

Buggy manages to shove Randolph off him. He raises the
RIFLE and SHOOTS at the cops. Randolph grabs him. Both
he and Buggy lose their footing and slip from the
catwalk. Randolph is able to grab onto the edge and hold
on. Buggy clutches Randolph's leg which threatens to
bring them both down. They dangle 80 feet above the
rink. Randolph desperately tries to hold onto the
catwalk as Buggy clings to Randolph's ankle.


CLOSE ON RANDOLPH'S FINGERS

His knuckles turn white as his fingers start to slip from
the beam.


ANGLE ON BUGGY

Still clutching Randolph's ankle, he starts to lose his
grip. He desperately grabs Randolph's foot, but
Randolph's shoe slips off and Buggy begins his long
plunge to the next life.


INT. RINK - HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT

Buggy screams the whole way down, still holding onto
Randolph's shoe.


RINK

Buggy crashes into the middle of the rink, cob-webbing
the ice around him.

                                                        116.

CATWALK

Tommy and his boys runs off to find Sheldon. The COPS
help Randolph off the catwalk. He's a nervous wreck.

                  COP #1
          You okay?

                  RANDOLPH
          I don't know. I'm kind of fucked
          up in general, so it's hard to
          gauge.

They pat the dazed Randolph on the back.   He passes out.


RINK

People continue to run through the rink. Felled
Rhinettes litter the ice like broken dolls. Smoke fills
the air. Sheldon is helping a random woman to her feet
as Nora finally reaches him. She embraces him.

                  NORA
          Burke's with Stokes.   He's been in
          it all along.

Sheldon looks toward the network box. Beyond it, through
the smoke, he sees Burke shoving his way through people
who jam the exit trying to escape. Sheldon reaches into
his costume and pulls out his gun.

                  NORA
          No, Sheldon, don't!

Sheldon runs off leaving Nora.


EXIT

Burke is almost through the cluster of people. He
glances over his shoulder and sees Sheldon heading
toward him. He shoves even harder now and finally
gets through.


EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Burke makes a run for it down 33rd Street. A moment
later, Sheldon emerges from the building. He sees Burke
in the distance and takes off after him. He's still in
his skates and wearing the partially-blown-off Smoochy
head.

                                                        117.

FURTHER DOWN STREET

Burke looks behind and sees the nightmarish image of a
disfigured Smoochy chasing after him. He quickly rounds
the corner.


EXT. STREET

A few moments later Sheldon rounds the corner. He looks
down the street and sees no sign of Burke. He notices an
alley by an abandoned building.


EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon walks slowly into the alley, gun drawn.
Suddenly, Burke jumps out from behind some boxes. He
whacks Sheldon's head with a garbage can lid. The gun
goes flying. Burke goes for it, but Sheldon is quickly
on his feet and pounces on him. The two men fight it
out. Burke manages to get on top of Sheldon and starts
to strangle him.

                        BURKE
          You fucking point a gun at me? A
          gun I gave you as a gift?! Where's
          your fucking etiquette?

Just as Sheldon begins to lose consciousness, we hear a
GUNSHOT. Burke looks up. Nora stands there, pointing
Sheldon's gun directly at him.

                           NORA
          Let him go.

Burke just looks at her.

                        NORA
          Now. Before I pump one in that
          Grecian Formula scalp of yours.

Burke smirks as he releases Sheldon. Sheldon jumps up
and takes the gun from Nora. He shakily points it at
Burke.

                  BURKE
          You know something, kid? You've
          turned out to be an incredible
          pain in the ass.

Burke slowly stands up, brushing off his suit.

                             SHELDON
          You were behind the Spinner hit,
          weren't you?

                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                        118.

CONTINUED:

                     BURKE
             That was a tragic mistake.
                    (shakes head sadly)
             If only one could turn back time...
                    (beat)
             But what the hell, it's just one
             less mick in the world.

He laughs.

                           NORA
             You son-of-a-bitch.

Sheldon cocks the gun.

                     BURKE
             Oh my. What are you gonna do?
             Kill me? That wouldn't be very
             Smoochy-like behavior.

                      SHELDON
             You're right. There's just one
             thing...

Sheldon tears off the remains of his tattered costume and
steps out of it.

                     SHELDON
             I'm not Smoochy.

Sheldon is shaking as he extends the gun to Burke's head.

                     SHELDON
             I finally realized we're living in
             a different jungle.

Burke suddenly looks fearful, as does Nora.

                             NORA
             No, Sheldon.

Sheldon closes his eyes as he tries to summon up the
courage to pull the trigger.

                             NORA
             Sheldon!

Suddenly, there's a voice from behind.

                           VOICE (O.S.)
             Don't do it, Shel.

Sheldon turns around.       It's Tommy and her boys.

                                          (CONTINUED)

                                                     119.

                     SHELDON
                (sternly)
             Stay out of it, Tommy.   This is my
             business.

Tommy walks closer to Sheldon.

                     TOMMY
             No more killin', Shel. Enough's
             enough. Don't destroy who you are
             for this piece of shit. You mean
             something to the kids. Don't take
             Smoochy away from the kids.

Tommy extends her hand for the gun. Sheldon looks down
at the gun. He can't believe he's even holding it. He
hands it to Tommy.

                           SHELDON
             I don't know how I got pushed this
             far.

                           TOMMY
             You're only human, Shel. The
             important thing is... you never
             went over the cliff. You're a
             good boy. For some of us... it's
             too late.

Tommy pats Sheldon's shoulder affectionately.

                     TOMMY
             We'll take it from here, kid, you
             run along with your girl. Get on
             with your life.

Sheldon looks over at Burke, who's petrified.

                           SHELDON
             Tommy, you're not going to --

                           TOMMY
             Don't worry. Sometimes even a
             rat deserves a little mercy.

Sheldon and Nora take a final look at Burke before
walking out of the alley. Burke is wide-eyed with fear
as Tommy's boys advance on him. Just as they round the
corner there is the sound of TWO GUNSHOTS. Sheldon looks
at Nora.

                             NORA
             Bus backfire.

She pats him on the back.

                                                          120.

EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Stokes finally makes it out of the arena. He runs toward
his waiting limo and hops in the back seat. He barks to
his driver through the glass partition.

                  STOKES
          Get out of here!

The car doesn't move.   Stokes pounds on the partition.

                  STOKES
          Move this thing!

No response. Stokes frantically pushes the button that
lowers the partition. It slides down.

                  STOKES
          Are you deaf?! I said --

The driver turns around. Stokes recoils in horror. It's
Takashi. He smiles as the back doors open and the
Japanese thugs -- Chick, Sambo and Tobi -- pile in with
Stokes. They slam the doors shut.

                  CHICK
          I wish I could tell you it'll be
          quick and painless, Frank, but you
          know how these things go...

Stokes lets out a small whimper. Chick nods to Takashi
who steps on the gas as he sings "Anything Goes" in
Japanese.


EXT. TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The car heads into the night, passing Sheldon and Nora,
who have exited the alley. This will be Frank Stokes'
final limo ride.


EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Sheldon and Nora pause on the street.    Sheldon looks
around him.

                        SHELDON
          You know, a little grime here and
          there doesn't change the fact...
          it's still a beautiful city.

He looks at Nora.

Sheldon gazes back at her.

                     SHELDON
             No it's not. It's just beginning.

They kiss passionately as MUSIC SWELLS and the CAMERA
CRANES HIGH ABOVE the rink.

                                                 FADE OUT.


FADE UP ON:


INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ONE YEAR LATER

SUPERIMPOSE:    ONE YEAR LATER

The Garden is sold out.    The lights go down.    Through the
P.A. we hear...

             And now... it gives us great
             pleasure to introduce America's
             favorite rhino... ladies and
             gentlemen... boys and girls...

There's a dramatic pause; TYMPANY ROLL.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             Heeeeeere's Smoochy!

Smoochy skates out to thunderous applause.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             With his partner and comrade...
             the one, the only... Rainbow
             Randolph!

Randolph skates out, somewhat shakily, to huge applause.
Sheldon puts his arm around him. The audience is now on
their feet. Randolph especially basks in the adulation.

                     ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             All proceeds from tonight's
             performance, will benefit the
             Rainbow Randolph Center for
             Alcoholism and Delusional
             Behavior.

                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                     122.

CONTINUED:

Sheldon pats Randolph on the back. MUSIC BEGINS as
Rhinettes and Krinkle Kids skate out. The show starts
and the audience goes wild. Nora smiles from the stands
as Smoochy and the others glide across the ice. (SMOOCHY
/RANDOLPH DUET TO COME.)


                                    FADE OUT.




                        THE END
